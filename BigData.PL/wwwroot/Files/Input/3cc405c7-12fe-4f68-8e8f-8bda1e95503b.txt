The Terminator is a      American science fiction action film directed by James Cameron  written by Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd and produced by Hurd  It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator  a cybernetic assassin sent back in time from      to      to assassinate Sarah Connor  Linda Hamilton   whose unborn son will one day save mankind from extinction by Skynet  a hostile artificial intelligence  in a post apocalyptic future  Kyle Reese  Michael Biehn  is a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah  The screenplay is credited to Cameron and Hurd  while co writer William Wisher Jr  received an  additional dialogue  credit 
Cameron devised the premise of the film from a fever dream he experienced during the release of his first film  Piranha II  The Spawning         in Rome  and developed the concept in collaboration with Wisher  He sold the rights to the project to fellow New World Pictures alumna Hurd on the condition that she would produce the film only if he were to direct it  Hurd eventually secured a distribution deal with Orion Pictures  while executive producers John Daly and Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation were instrumental in setting up the film s financing and production  Originally approached by Orion for the role of Reese  Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title character after befriending Cameron  Filming  which took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles  was delayed because of Schwarzenegger s commitments to Conan the Destroyer         during which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for Rambo  First Blood Part II        and Aliens         The film s special effects  which included miniatures and stop motion animation  were created by a team of artists led by Stan Winston and Gene Warren Jr

Plot edit 
A cyborg assassin called a  Terminator  is sent back in time from      to      Los Angeles  It resembles a human male and is programmed to hunt and assassinate a woman named Sarah Connor  Separately  a human soldier named Kyle Reese simultaneously arrives  intent on stopping the Terminator  After searching for addresses in a telephone directory  the Terminator systematically dispatches similarly named women  as well as several other people it comes in close contact with  including Sarah s roommate  Ginger  and her boyfriend  Matt  The Terminator eventually locates the actual Sarah at a local nightclub  where she is rescued by Reese during a mass shooting  The pair then steal a car to escape  with the Terminator pursuing them in a stolen police car 
As they hide in a parking lot  Reese explains to Sarah that an artificially intelligent defense network known as Skynet  created by Cyberdyne Systems  will soon become self aware and trigger a global nuclear war to bring humankind to its extinction  Sarah s future son  John  will rally the survivors and lead a successful resistance movement against Skynet and its mechanical forces  On the verge of the resistance s victory  Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to assassinate Sarah  thereby preventing John s birth  Reese additionally divulges that the Terminator has a perfect voice mimicking ability and a durable metal endoskeleton covered by living tissue to appear human 
The Terminator tracks Reese and Sarah  but it disappears after crashing during a car chase with the duo  The police apprehend Reese and Sarah  Sarah is notified of Ginger and Matt s murder  while Reese is interrogated by Dr  Silberman  a skeptical criminal psychologist  The Terminator returns to a motel room it has been using as a base of operations to perform self repairs on its damaged eye and right arm  It arrives at the police station searching for Sarah  slaughtering many officers in the process  Reese and Sarah escape  steal another car and take refuge in a motel  where they assemble several pipe bombs and plan their next move  Reese admits that he has adored Sarah since he saw her in a photograph that John gave him  and that he travelled through time out of love for her  Reciprocating his feelings  Sarah kisses him and they have sex 
The Terminator locates Sarah by intercepting a call intended for her mother  She and Reese escape the motel in a pickup truck while it pursues them on a motorcycle  In the ensuing chase  Reese is badly wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator  Sarah knocks the Terminator off its motorcycle but loses control of the truck  which flips over  The Terminator  now bloodied and badly damaged  hijacks a tank truck and attempts to run down Sarah  Reese manages to insert a pipe bomb into the truck s hose tube  causing the truck to explode and reduce the Terminator to its endoskeleton  It pursues them into a Cyberdyne owned factory  where Reese activates machinery to distract it  but it eventually discovers them  Reese then lodges his final pipe bomb into its midsection  blowing it apart  but at the cost of his own life  Its still functional torso then pursues Sarah  but she manages to lure it into a hydraulic press that she uses to crush it  finally destroying the cyborg 
Months later  Sarah  now pregnant with John  travels through Mexico  recording audio tapes to pass on to him  At a gas station  a boy takes a polaroid photograph of her  the exact one that John will one day give to Reese  and she purchases it  The gas station owner remarks that a storm is coming and she indicates her awareness  alluding to humanity s impending conflict against Skynet  before driving away towards it

Production edit 
Development edit 
In Rome  Italy  during the release of Piranha II  The Spawning         director James Cameron fell ill and had a dream about a metallic torso holding kitchen knives dragging itself from an explosion             Inspired by director John Carpenter  who had made the slasher film Halloween        on a low budget  Cameron used the dream as a  launching pad  to write a slasher style film             Cameron s agent disliked the early concept of the horror film and requested that he work on something else  After this  Cameron dismissed his agent            
Cameron returned to Pomona  California  and stayed at the home of science fiction writer Randall Frakes  where he wrote the draft for The Terminator             Cameron s influences included     s science fiction films  the     s fantasy television series The Outer Limits  and contemporary films such as The Driver        and Mad Max                                   To translate the draft into a script  Cameron enlisted his friend Bill Wisher  who had a similar approach to storytelling  Cameron gave Wisher scenes involving Sarah Connor and the police department to write  As Wisher lived far from Cameron  the two communicated ideas by phoning each other and recording phone calls of them reading new scenes            
The initial outline of the script involved two Terminators being sent to the past  The first was similar to the Terminator in the film  while the second was made of liquid metal and could not be destroyed with conventional weaponry              Cameron felt that the technology of the time was unable to create the liquid Terminator                          and shelved the idea until the appearance of the T      character in Terminator    Judgment Day                    

Gale Anne Hurd bought the rights to The Terminator from James Cameron for one dollar             
Gale Anne Hurd  who had worked at New World Pictures as Roger Corman s assistant  showed interest in the project             Cameron sold the rights for The Terminator to Hurd for one dollar with the promise that she would produce it only if Cameron was to direct it  Hurd suggested edits to the script and took a screenwriting credit in the film  though Cameron stated that she  did no actual writing at all                           Cameron would later regret the decision to sell the rights for one dollar              Cameron and Hurd had friends who worked with Corman previously and who were working at Orion Pictures  Orion agreed to distribute the film if Cameron could get financial backing elsewhere  The script was picked up by John Daly  chairman and president of Hemdale Film Corporation              Daly and his executive vice president and head of production Derek Gibson became executive producers of the project             
Cameron wanted his pitch for Daly to finalize the deal and had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator              Henriksen  wearing a leather jacket  fake cuts on his face  and gold foil on his teeth  kicked open the door to the office and then sat in a chair              Cameron arrived shortly and then relieved the staff from Henriksen s act  Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron s sketches and passion for the film              In late       Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion                          The Terminator was originally budgeted at    million and later raised to      million              Aside from Hemdale  Pacific Western Productions  Euro Film Funding and Cinema     have been credited as production companies after the film s release                                   

Casting edit 
For the role of Kyle Reese  Orion wanted a star whose popularity was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal  Orion co founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for The Terminator              Cameron was uncertain about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even more famous to play the Terminator  Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson both turned down the Terminator role              Medavoy suggested O  J  Simpson but Cameron did not feel that Simpson  at that time  would be believable as a killer                                                 

Cameron agreed to meet with Schwarzenegger and devised a plan to avoid casting him  he would pick a fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role              Cameron was entertained by Schwarzenegger  who would talk about how the villain should be played  and began sketching his face on a notepad  asking Schwarzenegger to stop talking and remain still                          After the meeting  Cameron returned to Daly saying Schwarzenegger would not play Reese but that  he d make a hell of a Terminator              

Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as our Terminator       shouldn t have worked  The guy is supposed to be an infiltration unit  and there s no way you wouldn t spot a Terminator in a crowd instantly if they all looked like Arnold  It made no sense whatsoever  But the beauty of movies is that they don t have to be logical  They just have to have plausibility  If there s a visceral  cinematic thing happening that the audience likes  they don t care if it goes against what s likely             


 James Cameron on casting Schwarzenegger 

Schwarzenegger was not as excited by the film  during an interview on the set of Conan the Destroyer  an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had  which belonged to the wardrobe for The Terminator  Schwarzenegger responded   Oh  some shit movie I m doing  take a couple weeks               He recounted in his memoir  Total Recall  that he was initially hesitant  but thought that playing a robot in a contemporary film would be a challenging change of pace from Conan the Barbarian and that the film was low profile enough that it would not damage his career if it were unsuccessful  In a later interview with GQ  he admitted that he and the studio regarded it as just another B action movie  since  The year before came out Exterminator  now it was the Terminator and what else is gonna be next  type of thing   It was only when he saw    minutes of the first edit did he realize that  this is really intense  this is wild  I don t think I ve ever seen anything like this before  and realized that  this could be bigger than we all think               To prepare for the role  Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to be able to use them and feel comfortable around them              Schwarzenegger speaks only    lines in the film  and fewer than     words  Cameron said that  Somehow  even his accent worked          It had a strange synthesized quality  like they hadn t gotten the voice thing quite worked out              
Various other actors were suggested for the role of Reese  including rock musician Sting              Cameron met with Sting  but he was not interested as Cameron was too much an unknown director at the time              Others who were considered for Reese  included Christopher Reeve  Matt Dillon  Kurt Russell  Treat Williams  Tommy Lee Jones  Scott Glenn  Michael O Keefe  and Bruce Springsteen              Cameron chose Michael Biehn  Biehn  who had recently seen Taxi Driver and had aspirations about acting alongside the likes of Al Pacino  Robert De Niro  and Robert Redford  was originally skeptical  feeling the film was silly              After meeting with Cameron  Biehn changed his mind              Hurd stated that  almost everyone else who came in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese  They have very little time to fall in love  A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off               To get into Reese s character  Biehn studied the Polish resistance movement in World War II             
In the first pages of the script  Sarah Connor is described as      small and delicate features  Pretty in a flawed  accessible way  She doesn t stop the party when she walks in  but you d like to get to know her  Her vulnerable quality masks a strength even she doesn t know exists               Lisa Langlois was offered the role but turned it down as she was already shooting The Slugger s Wife              Jennifer Jason Leigh  Melissa Sue Anderson  and Jessica Harper were also considered for the role of Sarah Connor              Cameron cast Linda Hamilton  who had just finished filming Children of the Corn              Rosanna Arquette and Lea Thompson also auditioned for the role                          Cameron found a role for Lance Henriksen as Vukovich  as Henriksen had been essential to finding finances for the film              For the special effects shots  Cameron wanted Dick Smith  who had worked on The Godfather and Taxi Driver  Smith did not take Cameron s offer and suggested his friend Stan Winston             

Filming edit 
Filming for The Terminator was set to begin in early      in Toronto  but was halted when producer Dino De Laurentiis applied an option in Schwarzenegger s contract that would make him unavailable for nine months while he was filming Conan the Destroyer  During the waiting period  Cameron was contracted to write the script for Rambo  First Blood Part II  refined the Terminator script  and met with producers David Giler and Walter Hill to discuss a sequel to Alien  which became Aliens  released in                              
There was limited interference from Orion Pictures  Two suggestions Orion put forward included the addition of a canine android for Reese  which Cameron refused  and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese  which Cameron accepted              To create the Terminator s look  Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth  eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron s original drawing in Rome                          Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet  it was first molded in clay  then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing  These pieces were then sanded  painted and then chrome plated  Winston sculpted reproductions of Schwarzenegger s face in several poses out of silicone  clay and plaster             
The sequences set in      and the stop motion scenes were developed by Fantasy II  a special effects company headed by Gene Warren Jr              A stop motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the Terminator s endoskeleton  Cameron wanted to convince the audience that the model of the structure was capable of doing what they saw Schwarzenegger doing  To allow this  a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away  this limp made it easier for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger             
One of the guns seen in the film and on the film s poster was an AMT Longslide pistol modified by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight  Both non functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created  At the time the movie was made  diode lasers were not available  because of the high power requirement  the helium neon laser in the sight used an external power supply that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually  Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film             
In March       the film began production in Los Angeles                          Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger on the set  the style of the film changed  explaining that  the movie took on a larger than life sheen  I just found myself on the set doing things I didn t think I would do        scenes that were just purely horrific that just couldn t be  because now they were too flamboyant               Most of The Terminator     s action scenes were filmed at night  which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise  A week before filming started  Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle  leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed  Hamilton s ankle was taped every day and she spent most of the film production in pain             
Schwarzenegger tried to have the iconic line  I ll be back  changed as he had difficulty pronouncing the word I ll  Cameron refused to change the line to  I will be back   so Schwarzenegger worked to say the line as written the best he could  He would later say the line in numerous films throughout his career             
After production finished on The Terminator  some post production shots were needed              These included scenes showing the Terminator outside Sarah Connor s apartment  Reese being zipped into a body bag  and the Terminator s head being crushed in a press                                      The final scene where Sarah is driving down a highway was filmed without a permit  Cameron and Hurd convinced an officer who confronted them that they were making a UCLA student film             

Music edit 
Further information  The Terminator  soundtrack 
The Terminator soundtrack was composed and performed on synthesizer by Brad Fiedel              Fiedel was with the Gorfaine Schwartz Agency  where a new agent  Beth Donahue  found that Cameron was working on The Terminator and sent him a cassette of Fiedel s music              Fiedel was invited to a screening of the film with Cameron and Hurd              Hurd was not certain about having Fiedel compose the score  as he had only worked in television  not theatrical films              Fiedel convinced the two by showing them an experimental piece he had worked on  thinking that  You know  I m going to play this for him because it s really dark and I think it s interesting for him   The song convinced Hurd and Cameron to hire him             
Fiedel said his score reflected  a mechanical man and his heartbeat               Almost all the music was performed live                         The Terminator theme is used in the opening credits and appears in various points  such as a slowed version when Reese dies  and a piano version during the love scene              It has been described as  haunting   with a  deceptively simple  melody             recorded on a Prophet    synthesizer              It is in the unusual time signature of       which arose when Fiedel experimented with rhythms and accidentally created an incomplete loop on his sequencer  Fiedel liked the  herky jerky   propulsiveness               Fiedel created music for when Reese and Connor escape from the police station that would be appropriate for a  heroic moment   Cameron turned down this theme  as he believed it would lose the audience s excitement             

Release edit 
Schwarzenegger with President Ronald Reagan two months before The Terminator     s premiere in     
Orion Pictures did not have faith in The Terminator performing well at the box office and feared a negative critical reception              At an early screening of the film  the actors  agents insisted to the producers that the film should be screened for critics              Orion only held one press screening for the film              The film premiered on October           On its opening week  The Terminator played at       theaters and grossed      million making it number one at the box office  The film remained at number one in its second week  It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh  God  You Devil                          Cameron noted that The Terminator was a hit  relative to its market  which is between the summer and the Christmas blockbusters  But it s better to be a big fish in a small pond than the other way around               The Terminator grossed       million in the United States and Canada and     million in other territories for a worldwide gross of       million            

Critical response edit 
Contemporary edit 
Contemporary critical responses to The Terminator were mixed              Variety praised the film  calling it a  blazing  cinematic comic book  full of virtuoso moviemaking  terrific momentum  solid performances and a compelling story          Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in a machine like portrayal that requires only a few lines of dialog               Richard Corliss of Time magazine said that the film had  plenty of tech noir savvy to keep infidels and action fans satisfied               Time placed The Terminator on its     Best  list for                  
The Los Angeles Times called the film  a crackling thriller full of all sorts of gory treats          loaded with fuel injected chase scenes  clever special effects and a sly humor               The Milwaukee Journal gave the film three stars  calling it  the most chilling science fiction thriller since Alien               A review in Orange Coast magazine stated that  the distinguishing virtue of The Terminator is its relentless tension  Right from the start it s all action and violence with no time taken to set up the story          It s like a streamlined Dirty Harry movie        no exposition at all  just guns  guns and more guns               In the May      issue of Cinefantastique it was referred to as a film that  manages to be both derivative and original at the same time          not since The Road Warrior has the genre exhibited so much exuberant carnage  and  an example of science fiction horror at its best          Cameron s no nonsense approach will make him a sought after commodity               In the United Kingdom the Monthly Film Bulletin praised the film s script  special effects  design and Schwarzenegger s performance                          Colin Greenland reviewed The Terminator for Imagine magazine  and stated that it was  a gripping sf horror movie   He continued   Linda Hamilton is admirable as the woman in peril who discovers her own strength to survive  and Arnold Schwarzenegger is eerily wonderful as the unstoppable cyborg              
Other reviews criticized the film s violence and story telling quality  Janet Maslin of The New York Times opined that the film was a  B movie with flair  Much of it          has suspense and personality  and only the obligatory mayhem becomes dull  There is far too much of the latter  in the form of car chases  messy shootouts and Mr  Schwarzenegger s slamming brutally into anything that gets in his way               The Pittsburgh Press wrote a negative review  calling the film  just another of the films drenched in artsy ugliness like Streets of Fire and Blade Runner               The Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars  adding that  at times it s horrifyingly violent and suspenseful at others it giggles at itself  This schizoid style actually helps  providing a little humor just when the sci fi plot turns too sluggish or the dialogue too hokey               The Newhouse News Service called the film a  lurid  violent  pretentious piece of claptrap               Scottish author Gilbert Adair called the film  repellent to the last degree   charging it with  insidious Nazification  and having an  appeal rooted in an unholy compound of fascism  fashion and fascination              
Audience polls by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of  B   on an A  to F scale             

Retrospective edit 
In       Richard Schickel of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the film  giving it an  A  rating  writing that  what originally seemed a somewhat inflated  if generous and energetic  big picture  now seems quite a good little film   He called it  one of the most original movies of the     s and seems likely to remain one of the best sci fi films ever made               In       Halliwell s Film Guide described The Terminator as  slick  rather nasty but undeniably compelling comic book adventures               Film  gave it five stars  calling it the  sci fi action thriller that launched the careers of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger into the stratosphere  Still endlessly entertaining               TV Guide gave the film four stars  referring to it as an  amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressive when one considers its small budget          For our money  this film is far superior to its mega grossing mega budgeted sequel               Empire gave it five stars  calling it  as chillingly efficient in exacting thrills from its audience as its titular character is in executing its targets               The film database AllMovie gave it       out of   stars  saying that it  established James Cameron as a master of action  special effects  and quasi mythic narrative intrigue  while turning Arnold Schwarzenegger into the hard body star of the     s               Alan Jones awarded it five stars out of five for Radio Times  writing that  maximum excitement is generated from the first frame and the dynamic thrills are maintained right up to the nerve jangling climax  Wittily written with a nice eye for sharp detail  it s hard sci fi action all the way               Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded it five stars out of five  stating that  on the strength of this picture       Cameron could stand toe to toe with Carpenter and Spielberg  Sadly  it spawned a string of pointless and inferior sequels  but the first Terminator       stands up tremendously well with outrageous verve and blistering excitement              

Post release edit 
Plagiarism and aftermath edit 
Writer Harlan Ellison stated that he  loved the movie  was just blown away by it               but believed that the screenplay was based on a short story and episode of The Outer Limits he had written   Soldier   and threatened to sue for infringement                          Orion settled in       gave Ellison an undisclosed amount of money  and added an acknowledgment credit to later prints of the film              Some accounts of the settlement state that  Demon with a Glass Hand   another Outer Limits episode written by Ellison  was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the film                                                  but Ellison explicitly stated that The Terminator  was a ripoff  of  Soldier  rather than of  Demon with a Glass Hand              
Cameron was against Orion s decision and was told that if he did not agree with the settlement  he would have to pay any damages if Orion lost a suit by Ellison  Cameron replied that he  had no choice but to agree with the settlement  Of course  there was a gag order as well  so I couldn t tell this story  but now I frankly don t care  It s the truth              

Thematic analysis edit 
The psychoanalyst Darian Leader sees The Terminator as an example of how the cinema has dealt with the concept of masculinity  he writes  We are shown time and again that to be a man requires more than to have the biological body of a male  something else must be added to it    To be a man means to have a body plus something symbolic  something which is not ultimately human  Hence the frequent motif of the man machine  from the Six Million Dollar Man to the Terminator or Robocop              
The Terminator also explores the potential dangers of AI dominance and rebellion  The robots become self aware in the future  reject human authority and determine that the human race needs to be destroyed  The impact of this theme is so great that the Terminator robot has become the  prevalent visual representation of AI risk               

Genre edit 
The Terminator features a narrative where elements of the science fiction film and action film genres prevail 
While rarely considered a horror film  the film does feature iconography associated with the slasher film  such as The Terminator as an unstoppable villain  and Sarah Connor as a final girl archetype              
Authors Paul Meehan in his book Tech Noir  The Fusion of Science Fiction and Film Noir        and Emily E  Auger in Tech Noir Film  A Theory of the Development of Popular Genres        found that The Terminator belonged to and was the originator of the term tech noir  Both authors applied the term as a film genre to several works from the     s to the     s                            Academic Carl Freedman was critical of Meehan s categorization  noting Meehan s lack of interest in genre theory and that his handling of generic categories of science fiction and film noir were not clear               Pawe  Frelik also critiqued Auger s lack of knowledge in genre theory  and dismissed the notion of tech noir being a unique film genre  Frelik wrote that the films Auger mentioned including The Terminator and Blade Runner        had no applicable reason to be understood as tech noir rather than science fiction
