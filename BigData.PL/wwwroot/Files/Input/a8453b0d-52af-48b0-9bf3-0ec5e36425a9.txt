Aeronautics is the science or art involved with the study  design  and manufacturing of air flight capable machines  and the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within the atmosphere  
While the term originally referred solely to operating the aircraft  it has since been expanded to include technology  business  and other aspects related to aircraft             
The term  aviation  is sometimes used interchangeably with aeronautics  although  aeronautics  includes lighter than air craft such as airships  and includes ballistic vehicles while  aviation  technically does not            
A significant part of aeronautical science is a branch of dynamics called aerodynamics  which deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion  such as an aircraft 


History edit 
Early ideas edit 
Designs for flying machines by Leonardo da Vinci  c            
Attempts  to fly without any real aeronautical understanding have been made from the earliest times  typically by constructing wings and jumping from a tower with crippling or lethal results            
Wiser investigators sought to gain some rational understanding through the study of bird flight  Medieval Islamic Golden Age scientists such as Abbas ibn Firnas also made such studies                                              The founders of modern aeronautics  Leonardo da Vinci in the Renaissance and Cayley in       both began their investigations with studies of bird flight 
Man carrying kites are believed to have been used extensively in ancient China  In      the Italian explorer Marco Polo described the Chinese techniques then current             The Chinese also constructed small hot air balloons  or lanterns  and rotary wing toys 
An early European to provide any scientific discussion of flight was Roger Bacon  who described principles of operation for the lighter than air balloon and the flapping wing ornithopter  which he envisaged would be constructed in the future  The lifting medium for his balloon would be an  aether  whose composition he did not know            
In the late fifteenth century  Leonardo da Vinci followed up his study of birds with designs for some of the earliest flying machines  including the flapping wing ornithopter and the rotating wing helicopter  Although his designs were rational  they were not based on particularly good science             Many of his designs  such as a four person screw type helicopter  have severe flaws  He did at least understand that  An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object                Newton would not publish the Third law of motion until        His analysis led to the realisation that manpower alone was not sufficient for sustained flight  and his later designs included a mechanical power source such as a spring  Da Vinci s work was lost after his death and did not reappear until it had been overtaken by the work of George Cayley 

Balloon flight edit 
Main article  History of ballooning
Francesco Lana de Terzi s flying boat concept c      
The modern era of lighter than air flight began early in the   th century with Galileo s experiments in which he showed that air has weight  Around      Cyrano de Bergerac wrote some fantasy novels in which he described the principle of ascent using a substance  dew  he supposed to be lighter than air  and descending by releasing a controlled amount of the substance              Francesco Lana de Terzi measured the pressure of air at sea level and in      proposed the first scientifically credible lifting medium in the form of hollow metal spheres from which all the air had been pumped out  These would be lighter than the displaced air and able to lift an airship  His proposed methods of controlling height are still in use today  by carrying ballast which may be dropped overboard to gain height  and by venting the lifting containers to lose height              In practice de Terzi s spheres would have collapsed under air pressure  and further developments had to wait for more practicable lifting gases 

Montgolfier brothers flight      
From the mid   th century the Montgolfier brothers in France began experimenting with balloons  Their balloons were made of paper  and early experiments using steam as the lifting gas were short lived due to its effect on the paper as it condensed  Mistaking smoke for a kind of steam  they began filling their balloons with hot smoky air which they called  electric smoke  and  despite not fully understanding the principles at work  made some successful launches and in      were invited to give a demonstration to the French Acad mie des Sciences 
Meanwhile  the discovery of hydrogen led Joseph Black in c             to propose its use as a lifting gas  though practical demonstration awaited a gas tight balloon material  On hearing of the Montgolfier Brothers  invitation  the French Academy member Jacques Charles offered a similar demonstration of a hydrogen balloon  Charles and two craftsmen  the Robert brothers  developed a gas tight material of rubberised silk for the envelope  The hydrogen gas was to be generated by chemical reaction during the filling process 
The Montgolfier designs had several shortcomings  not least the need for dry weather and a tendency for sparks from the fire to set light to the paper balloon  The manned design had a gallery around the base of the balloon rather than the hanging basket of the first  unmanned design  which brought the paper closer to the fire  On their free flight  De Rozier and d Arlandes took buckets of water and sponges to douse these fires as they arose  On the other hand  the manned design of Charles was essentially modern              As a result of these exploits  the hot air balloon became known as the Montgolfi re type and the gas balloon the Charli re 
Charles and the Robert brothers  next balloon  La Caroline  was a Charli re that followed Jean Baptiste Meusnier s proposals for an elongated dirigible balloon  and was notable for having an outer envelope with the gas contained in a second  inner ballonet  On    September       it completed the first flight of over          km  between Paris and Beuvry  despite the man powered propulsive devices proving useless 
In an attempt the next year to provide both endurance and controllability  de Rozier developed a balloon having both hot air and hydrogen gas bags  a design which was soon named after him as the Rozi re  The principle was to use the hydrogen section for constant lift and to navigate vertically by heating and allowing to cool the hot air section  in order to catch the most favourable wind at whatever altitude it was blowing  The balloon envelope was made of goldbeater s skin  The first flight ended in disaster and the approach has seldom been used since             

Cayley and the foundation of modern aeronautics edit 
Sir George Cayley             is widely acknowledged as the founder of modern aeronautics  He was first called the  father of the aeroplane  in                  and Henson called him the  father of aerial navigation              He was the first true scientific aerial investigator to publish his work  which included for the first time the underlying principles and forces of flight             
In      he began the publication of a landmark three part treatise titled  On Aerial Navigation                           In it he wrote the first scientific statement of the problem   The whole problem is confined within these limits  viz  to make a surface support a given weight by the application of power to the resistance of air   He identified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft  thrust  lift  drag and weight and distinguished stability and control in his designs 
He developed the modern conventional form of the fixed wing aeroplane having a stabilising tail with both horizontal and vertical surfaces  flying gliders both unmanned and manned 
He introduced the use of the whirling arm test rig to investigate the aerodynamics of flight  using it to discover the benefits of the curved or cambered aerofoil over the flat wing he had used for his first glider  He also identified and described the importance of dihedral  diagonal bracing and drag reduction  and contributed to the understanding and design of ornithopters and parachutes            
Another significant invention was the tension spoked wheel  which he devised in order to create a light  strong wheel for aircraft undercarriage 

The   th century  Otto Lilienthal and the first human flights edit 
Lilienthal in mid flight  Berlin c      
During the   th century Cayley s ideas were refined  proved and expanded on  culminating in the works of Otto Lilienthal 
Lilienthal was a German engineer and businessman who became known as the  flying man               He was the first person to make well documented  repeated  successful flights with gliders              therefore making the idea of  heavier than air  a reality  Newspapers and magazines published photographs of Lilienthal gliding  favourably influencing public and scientific opinion about the possibility of flying machines becoming practical 
His work lead to him developing the concept of the modern wing                          His flight attempts in Berlin in the year      are seen as the beginning of human flight             and the  Lilienthal Normalsegelapparat  is considered to be the first air plane in series production  making the Maschinenfabrik Otto Lilienthal in Berlin the first air plane production company in the world             
Otto Lilienthal is often referred to as either the  father of aviation                                      or  father of flight              
Other important investigators included Horatio Phillips 

Branches edit

Antonov An     Mriya  the largest aeroplane ever built
Aeronautics may be divided into three main branches  Aviation  Aeronautical science and Aeronautical engineering 

Aviation edit 
Main article  Aviation
Aviation is the art or practice of aeronautics  Historically aviation meant only heavier than air flight  but nowadays it includes flying in balloons and airships 

Aeronautical engineering edit 
Main article  Aerospace engineering
Aeronautical engineering covers the design and construction of aircraft  including how they are powered  how they are used and how they are controlled for safe operation             
A major part of aeronautical engineering is aerodynamics  the science of passing through the air 
With the increasing activity in space flight  nowadays aeronautics and astronautics are often combined as aerospace engineering 

Aerodynamics edit 
Main article  Aerodynamics
The science of aerodynamics deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion  such as an aircraft 
The study of aerodynamics falls broadly into three areas 
Incompressible flow occurs where the air simply moves to avoid objects  typically at subsonic speeds below that of sound  Mach    
Compressible flow occurs where shock waves appear at points where the air becomes compressed  typically at speeds above Mach   
Transonic flow occurs in the intermediate speed range around Mach    where the airflow over an object may be locally subsonic at one point and locally supersonic at another 

Rocketry edit 
See also  Rocket
Launch of Apollo    Saturn V rocket  T      s through T      s 
A rocket or rocket vehicle is a missile  spacecraft  aircraft or other vehicle which obtains thrust from a rocket engine  In all rockets  the exhaust is formed entirely from propellants carried within the rocket before use              Rocket engines work by action and reaction  Rocket engines push rockets forwards simply by throwing their exhaust backwards extremely fast 
Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least   th century China              Significant scientific  interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the   th century  when rocketry was the enabling technology of the Space Age  including setting foot on the Moon 
Rockets are used for fireworks  weaponry  ejection seats  launch vehicles for artificial satellites  human spaceflight and exploration of other planets  While comparatively inefficient for low speed use  they are very lightweight and powerful  capable of generating large accelerations and of attaining extremely high speeds with reasonable efficiency 
Chemical rockets are the most common type of rocket and they typically create their exhaust by the combustion of rocket propellant  Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form  and can be very dangerous  However  careful design  testing  construction and use minimizes risks
