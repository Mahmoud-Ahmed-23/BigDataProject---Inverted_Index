A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations  computation   Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs  These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks  The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware  operating system  software  and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation  or to a group of computers that are linked and function together  such as a computer network or computer cluster 
A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems  including simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls  and factory devices like industrial robots  Computers are at the core of general purpose devices such as personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones  Computers power the Internet  which links billions of computers and users      citation needed     
Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations  Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times  Early in the Industrial Revolution  some mechanical devices were built to automate long  tedious tasks  such as guiding patterns for looms  More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early   th century  The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II  both electromechanical and using thermionic valves  The first semiconductor transistors in the late     s were followed by the silicon based MOSFET  MOS transistor  and monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies in the late     s  leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the     s  The speed  power  and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then  with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace  Moore s law noted that counts doubled every two years   leading to the Digital Revolution during the late   th and early   st centuries      citation needed     
Conventionally  a modern computer consists of at least one processing element  typically a central processing unit  CPU  in the form of a microprocessor  together with some type of computer memory  typically semiconductor memory chips  The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations  and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information  Peripheral devices include input devices  keyboards  mice  joysticks  etc    output devices  monitors  printers  etc    and input output devices that perform both functions  e g  touchscreens   Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source  and they enable the results of operations to be saved and retrieved      citation needed     


Etymology
A human computer  with microscope and calculator      
It was not until the mid   th century that the word acquired its modern definition  according to the Oxford English Dictionary  the first known use of the word computer was in a different sense  in a      book called The Yong Mans Gleanings by the English writer Richard Brathwait   I haue           sic      read the truest computer of Times  and the best Arithmetician that euer           sic      breathed  and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number   This usage of the term referred to a human computer  a person who carried out calculations or computations  The word continued to have the same meaning until the middle of the   th century  During the latter part of this period  women were often hired as computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts             By       most human computers were women            
The Online Etymology Dictionary gives the first attested use of computer in the     s  meaning  one who calculates   this is an  agent noun from compute  v     The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the use of the term to mean   calculating machine   of any type  is from        The Online Etymology Dictionary indicates that the  modern use  of the term  to mean  programmable digital electronic computer  dates from       under this name   in a  theoretical  sense  from       as Turing machine              The name has remained  although modern computers are capable of many higher level functions

The Ishango bone  a bone tool dating back to prehistoric Africa
Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years  mostly using one to one correspondence with fingers  The earliest counting device was most likely a form of tally stick  Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi  clay spheres  cones  etc   which represented counts of items  likely livestock or grains  sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers      a                 The use of counting rods is one example 

The Chinese suanpan       The number represented on this abacus is               
The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks  The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in Babylonia as early as      BCE  Since then  many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented  In a medieval European counting house  a checkered cloth would be placed on a table  and markers moved around on it according to certain rules  as an aid to calculating sums of money            

The Antikythera mechanism  dating back to ancient Greece circa        BCE  is an early analog computing device 
The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer  according to Derek J  de Solla Price             It was designed to calculate astronomical positions  It was discovered in      in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera  between Kythera and Crete  and has been dated to approximately c            BCE  Devices of comparable complexity to the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until the fourteenth century            
Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use  The planisphere was a star chart invented by Ab  Rayh n al B r n  in the early   th century             The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the  st or  nd centuries BCE and is often attributed to Hipparchus  A combination of the planisphere and dioptra  the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy  An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer                        and gear wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan  Persia in                   Ab  Rayh n al B r n  invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe              an early fixed wired knowledge processing machine             with a gear train and gear wheels              c             AD 
The sector  a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion  trigonometry  multiplication and division  and for various functions  such as squares and cube roots  was developed in the late   th century and found application in gunnery  surveying and navigation 
The planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage 

A slide rule
The slide rule was invented around            by the English clergyman William Oughtred  shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm  It is a hand operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division  As slide rule development progressed  added scales provided reciprocals  squares and square roots  cubes and cube roots  as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials  circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions  Slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations  such as the E B circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft 
In the     s  Pierre Jaquet Droz  a Swiss watchmaker  built a mechanical doll  automaton  that could write holding a quill pen  By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters  and hence different messages  could be produced  In effect  it could be mechanically  programmed  to read instructions  Along with two other complex machines  the doll is at the Mus e d Art et d Histoire of Neuch tel  Switzerland  and still operates             
In            mathematician and engineer Giovanni Plana devised a Perpetual Calendar machine  which through a system of pulleys and cylinders could predict the perpetual calendar for every year from   CE  that is    BCE  to      CE  keeping track of leap years and varying day length  The tide predicting machine invented by the Scottish scientist Sir William Thomson in      was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters  It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location 
The differential analyser  a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration  used wheel and disc mechanisms to perform the integration  In       Sir William Thomson had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators  but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball and disk integrators              In a differential analyzer  the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator  or a graphing output  The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work  Starting in the     s  Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers 
In the     s  the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo began to develop a series of advanced analog machines that could solve real and complex roots of polynomials                                                  which were published in      by the Paris Academy of Sciences             

First computer
Charles Babbage
A diagram of a portion of Babbage s Difference engineThe Difference Engine Number   at the Intellectual Ventures laboratory in Seattle
Charles Babbage  an English mechanical engineer and polymath  originated the concept of a programmable computer  Considered the  father of the computer               he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early   th century 
After working on his difference engine he announced his invention in       in a paper to the Royal Astronomical Society  titled  Note on the application of machinery to the computation of astronomical and mathematical tables               He also designed to aid in navigational calculations  in      he realized that a much more general design  an analytical engine  was possible  The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards  a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom  For output  the machine would have a printer  a curve plotter and a bell  The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later  The engine would incorporate an arithmetic logic unit  control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops  and integrated memory  making it the first design for a general purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing complete                         
The machine was about a century ahead of its time  All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand   this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts  Eventually  the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding  Babbage s failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to political and financial difficulties as well as his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow  Nevertheless  his son  Henry Babbage  completed a simplified version of the analytical engine s computing unit  the mill  in       He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in

  for a sequence of sets of values  The whole machine was to be controlled by a read only program  which was complete with provisions for conditional branching  He also introduced the idea of floating point arithmetic                                      In       to celebrate the    th anniversary of the invention of the arithmometer  Torres presented in Paris the Electromechanical Arithmometer  which allowed a user to input arithmetic problems through a keyboard  and computed and printed the results                                                  demonstrating the feasibility of an electromechanical analytical engine             

Analog computers

Sir William Thomson s third tide predicting machine design         
During the first half of the   th century  many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers  which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation  However  these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers              The first modern analog computer was a tide predicting machine  invented by Sir William Thomson  later to become Lord Kelvin  in       The differential analyser  a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel and disc mechanisms  was conceptualized in      by James Thomson  the elder brother of the more famous Sir William Thomson             
The art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the differential analyzer  built by H  L  Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT starting in       This built on the mechanical integrators of James Thomson and the torque amplifiers invented by H  W  Nieman  A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious      citation needed      By the     s  the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines  but analog computers remained in use during the     s in some specialized applications such as education  slide rule  and aircraft  control systems       citation needed

Claude Shannon s      master s thesis laid the foundations of digital computing  with his insight of applying Boolean algebra to the analysis and synthesis of switching circuits being the basic concept which underlies all electronic digital computers                         
By       the United States Navy had developed an electromechanical analog computer small enough to use aboard a submarine  This was the Torpedo Data Computer  which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target      citation needed      During World War II similar devices were developed in other countries as well      citation needed     

Replica of Konrad Zuse s Z   the first fully automatic  digital  electromechanical  computer
Early digital computers were electromechanical  electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation  These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all electric computers  originally using vacuum tubes  The Z   created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in      in Berlin  was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer             

Konrad Zuse  inventor of the modern computer                        
In       Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the Z   the world s first working electromechanical programmable  fully automatic digital computer                          The Z  was built with      relays  implementing a    bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about      Hz              Program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored in    words of memory or supplied from the keyboard  It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects  pioneering numerous advances such as floating point numbers  Rather than the harder to implement decimal system  used in Charles Babbage s earlier design   using a binary system meant that Zuse s machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable  given the technologies available at that time              The Z  was not itself a universal computer but could be extended to be Turing complete                         
Zuse s next computer  the Z   became the world s first commercial computer  after initial delay due to the Second World War  it was completed in      and delivered to the ETH Zurich              The computer was manufactured by Zuse s own company  Zuse KG  which was founded in      as the first company with the sole purpose of developing computers in Berlin              The Z  served as the inspiration for the construction of the ERMETH  the first Swiss computer and one of the first in Europe             

Vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits

Purely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents  at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog  The engineer Tommy Flowers  working at the Post Office Research Station in London in the     s  began to explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange  Experimental equipment that he built in      went into operation five years later  converting a portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system  using thousands of vacuum tubes              In the US  John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E  Berry of Iowa State University developed and tested the Atanasoff Berry Computer  ABC  in                   the first  automatic electronic digital computer               This design was also all electronic and used about     vacuum tubes  with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory             

Colossus  the first electronic digital programmable computing device  was used to break German ciphers during World War II  It is seen here in use at Bletchley Park in      
During World War II  the British code breakers at Bletchley Park achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military communications  The German encryption machine  Enigma  was first attacked with the help of the electro mechanical bombes which were often run by women                          To crack the more sophisticated German Lorenz SZ       machine  used for high level Army communications  Max Newman and his colleagues commissioned Flowers to build the Colossus              He spent eleven months from early February      designing and building the first Colossus              After a functional test in December       Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park  where it was delivered on    January                  and attacked its first message on   February             
Colossus was the world s first electronic digital programmable computer              It used a large number of valves  vacuum tubes   It had paper tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data  but it was not Turing complete  Nine Mk II Colossi were built  The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total   Colossus Mark I contained       thermionic valves  tubes   but Mark II with       valves  was both five times faster and simpler to operate than Mark I  greatly speeding the decoding process                         

ENIAC was the first electronic  Turing complete device  and performed ballistics trajectory calculations for the United States Army 
The ENIAC              Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer  was the first electronic programmable computer built in the U S  Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus  it was much faster  more flexible  and it was Turing complete  Like the Colossus  a  program  on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches  a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later  Once a program was written  it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches  The programmers of the ENIAC were six women  often known collectively as the  ENIAC girls                          
It combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems  It could add or subtract      times a second  a thousand times faster than any other machine  It also had modules to multiply  divide  and square root  High speed memory was limited to    words  about    bytes   Built under the direction of John Mauchly and J  Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania  ENIAC s development and construction lasted from      to full operation at the end of       The machine was huge  weighing    tons  using     kilowatts of electric power and contained over        vacuum tubes        relays  and hundreds of thousands of resistors  capacitors  and inductors             

Modern computers
Concept of modern computer
The principle of the modern computer was proposed by Alan Turing in his seminal      paper              On Computable Numbers  Turing proposed a simple device that he called  Universal Computing machine  and that is now known as a universal Turing machine  He proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions  program  stored on tape  allowing the machine to be programmable  The fundamental concept of Turing s design is the stored program  where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory  Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper              Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation  Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores  modern computers are said to be Turing complete  which is to say  they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine 

Stored programs
Main article  Stored program computer
A section of the reconstructed Manchester Baby  the first electronic stored program computer
Early computing machines had fixed programs  Changing its function required the re wiring and re structuring of the machine              With the proposal of the stored program computer this changed  A stored program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions  a program  that details the computation  The theoretical basis for the stored program computer was laid out by Alan Turing in his      paper  In       Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored program digital computer  His      report  Proposed Electronic Calculator  was the first specification for such a device  John von Neumann at the University of Pennsylvania also circulated his First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC in                  
The Manchester Baby was the world s first stored program computer  It was built at the University of Manchester in England by Frederic C  Williams  Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill  and ran its first program on    June                   It was designed as a testbed for the Williams tube  the first random access digital storage device              Although the computer was described as  small and primitive  by a      retrospective  it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer              As soon as the Baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design  a project began at the university to develop it into a practically useful computer  the Manchester Mark   
The Mark   in turn quickly became the prototype for the Ferranti Mark    the world s first commercially available general purpose computer              Built by Ferranti  it was delivered to the University of Manchester in February       At least seven of these later machines were delivered between      and       one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam              In October      the directors of British catering company J  Lyons  amp  Company decided to take an active role in promoting the commercial development of computers  Lyons s LEO I computer  modelled closely on the Cambridge EDSAC of       became operational in April                  and ran the world s first routine office computer job

Bipolar junction transistor  BJT 
The concept of a field effect transistor was proposed by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in       John Bardeen and Walter Brattain  while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs  built the first working transistor  the point contact transistor  in       which was followed by Shockley s bipolar junction transistor in                               From      onwards  transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs  giving rise to the  second generation  of computers  Compared to vacuum tubes  transistors have many advantages  they are smaller  and require less power than vacuum tubes  so give off less heat  Junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer  indefinite  service life  Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space  However  early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass production basis  which limited them to a number of specialized applications             
At the University of Manchester  a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves              Their first transistorized computer and the first in the world  was operational by       and a second version was completed there in April       However  the machine did make use of valves to generate its          kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory  so it was not the first completely transistorized computer  That distinction goes to the Harwell CADET of                   built by the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell

The metal oxide silicon field effect transistor  MOSFET   also known as the MOS transistor  was invented at Bell Labs between      and                                                                              and was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturized and mass produced for a wide range of uses              With its high scalability              and much lower power consumption and higher density than bipolar junction transistors              the MOSFET made it possible to build high density integrated circuits                          In addition to data processing  it also enabled the practical use of MOS transistors as memory cell storage elements  leading to the development of MOS semiconductor memory  which replaced earlier magnetic core memory in computers  The MOSFET led to the microcomputer revolution              and became the driving force behind the computer revolution                          The MOSFET is the most widely used transistor in computers                          and is the fundamental building block of digital electronics             

Integrated circuits

Further information  Planar process and Microprocessor
Integrated circuits are typically packaged in plastic  metal  or ceramic cases to protect the IC from damage and for ease of assembly 
The next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the integrated circuit  IC  
The idea of the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment of the Ministry of Defence  Geoffrey W A  Dummer  Dummer presented the first public description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic Components in Washington       D C   on   May                  
The first working ICs were invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor              Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July       successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on    September                   In his patent application of   February       Kilby described his new device as  a body of semiconductor material          wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely integrated                           However  Kilby s invention was a hybrid integrated circuit  hybrid IC   rather than a monolithic integrated circuit  IC  chip              Kilby s IC had external wire connections  which made it difficult to mass produce             
Noyce also came up with his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than Kilby              Noyce s invention was the first true monolithic IC chip                          His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby s had not  Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor  it was made of silicon  whereas Kilby s chip was made of germanium  Noyce s monolithic IC was fabricated using the planar process  developed by his colleague Jean Hoerni in early       In turn  the planar process was based on Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick work on semiconductor surface passivation by silicon dioxide                                                                               
Modern monolithic ICs are predominantly MOS  metal oxide semiconductor  integrated circuits  built from MOSFETs  MOS transistors                The earliest experimental MOS IC to be fabricated was a    transistor chip built by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA in                    General Microelectronics later introduced the first commercial MOS IC in                    developed by Robert Norman               Following the development of the self aligned gate  silicon gate  MOS transistor by Robert Kerwin  Donald Klein and John Sarace at Bell Labs in       the first silicon gate MOS IC with self aligned gates was developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild Semiconductor in                    The MOSFET has since become the most critical device component in modern ICs

The development of the MOS integrated circuit led to the invention of the microprocessor                            and heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers  While the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious  partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term  microprocessor   it is largely undisputed that the first single chip microprocessor was the Intel                    designed and realized by Federico Faggin with his silicon gate MOS IC technology               along with Ted Hoff  Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel      b                   In the early     s  MOS IC technology enabled the integration of more than        transistors on a single chip             
System on a Chip  SoCs  are complete computers on a microchip  or chip  the size of a coin               They may or may not have integrated RAM and flash memory  If not integrated  the RAM is usually placed directly above  known as Package on package  or below  on the opposite side of the circuit board  the SoC  and the flash memory is usually placed right next to the SoC  This is done to improve data transfer speeds  as the data signals do not have to travel long distances  Since ENIAC in       computers have advanced enormously  with modern SoCs  such as the Snapdragon      being the size of a coin while also being hundreds of thousands of times more powerful than ENIAC  integrating billions of transistors  and consuming only a few watts of power 

Mobile computers
The first mobile computers were heavy and ran from mains power  The         lb          kg  IBM      was an early example  Later portables such as the Osborne   and Compaq Portable were considerably lighter but still needed to be plugged in  The first laptops  such as the Grid Compass  removed this requirement by incorporating batteries   and with the continued miniaturization of computing resources and advancements in portable battery life  portable computers grew in popularity in the     s               The same developments allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular mobile phones by the early     s 
These smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and recently became the dominant computing device on the market               These are powered by System on a Chip  SoCs   which are complete computers on a microchip the size of a coin

A general purpose computer has four main components  the arithmetic logic unit  ALU   the control unit  the memory  and the input and output devices  collectively termed I O   These parts are interconnected by buses  often made of groups of wires  Inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small electrical circuits which can be turned off or on by means of an electronic switch  Each circuit represents a bit  binary digit  of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a      and when off it represents a      in positive logic representation   The circuits are arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits 

Input devices
When unprocessed data is sent to the computer with the help of input devices  the data is processed and sent to output devices  The input devices may be hand operated or automated  The act of processing is mainly regulated by the CPU  Some examples of input devices are 

Computer keyboard

Image scanner
Joystick
Microphone
Mouse
Overlay keyboard

Control unit
Main articles  CPU design and Control unit
Diagram showing how a particular MIPS architecture instruction would be decoded by the control system
The control unit  often called a control system or central controller  manages the computer s various components  it reads and interprets  decodes  the program instructions  transforming them into control signals that activate other parts of the computer      d      Control systems in advanced computers may change the order of execution of some instructions to improve performance 
A key component common to all CPUs is the program counter  a special memory cell  a register  that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from      e     
The control system s function is as follows  this is a simplified description  and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of CPU 

Read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter 
Decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems 
Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction 
Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory  or perhaps from an input device   The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code 
Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register 
If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete  instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation 
Write the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device 
Jump back to step     
Since the program counter is  conceptually  just another set of memory cells  it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU  Adding     to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place     locations further down the program  Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as  jumps  and allow for loops  instructions that are repeated by the computer  and often conditional instruction execution  both examples of control flow  
The sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program  and indeed  in some more complex CPU designs  there is another yet smaller computer called a microsequencer  which runs a microcode program that causes all of these events to happen 

Central processing unit  CPU 
Main articles  Central processing unit and Microprocessor
The control unit  ALU  and registers are collectively known as a central processing unit  CPU   Early CPUs were composed of many separate components  Since the     s  CPUs have typically been constructed on a single MOS integrated circuit chip called a microprocessor 

Arithmetic logic unit  ALU 
Main article  Arithmetic logic unit
The ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations  arithmetic and logic               The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction  or might include multiplication  division  trigonometry functions such as sine  cosine  etc   and square roots  Some can operate only on whole numbers  integers  while others use floating point to represent real numbers  albeit with limited precision  However  any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform  Therefore  any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation although it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation  An ALU may also compare numbers and return Boolean truth values  true or false  depending on whether one is equal to  greater than or less than the other   is    greater than        Logic operations involve Boolean logic  AND  OR  XOR  and NOT  These can be useful for creating complicated conditional statements and processing Boolean logic 
Superscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs  allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously               Graphics processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often contain ALUs that can perform arithmetic on vectors and matrices 

Memory
Main articles  Computer memory and Computer data storage
Magnetic core memory  using magnetic cores  was the computer memory of choice in the     s  until it was replaced by semiconductor memory  using MOS memory cells  
A computer s memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read  Each cell has a numbered  address  and can store a single number  The computer can be instructed to  put the number     into the cell numbered       or to  add the number that is in cell      to the number that is in cell      and put the answer into cell        The information stored in memory may represent practically anything  Letters  numbers  even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease  Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information  it is the software s responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers 
In almost all modern computers  each memory cell is set up to store binary numbers in groups of eight bits  called a byte   Each byte is able to represent     different numbers             either from   to     or      to       To store larger numbers  several consecutive bytes may be used  typically  two  four or eight   When negative numbers are required  they are usually stored in two s complement notation  Other arrangements are possible  but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts  A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically  Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory 
The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called registers that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area  There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU  Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed  As data is constantly being worked on  reducing the need to access main memory  which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units  greatly increases the computer s speed 
Computer main memory comes in two principal varieties 

random access memory or RAM
read only memory or ROM
RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it  but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes  therefore the CPU can only read from it  ROM is typically used to store the computer s initial start up instructions  In general  the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off  but ROM retains its data indefinitely  In a PC  the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer s operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset  In embedded computers  which frequently do not have disk drives  all of the required software may be stored in ROM  Software stored in ROM is often called firmware  because it is notionally more like hardware than software  Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM  as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable  It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however  so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary      f     
In more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM cache memories  which are slower than registers but faster than main memory  Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically  often without the need for any intervention on the programmer s part 

Input output  I O 
Main article  Input output
Hard disk drives are common storage devices used with computers 
I O is the means by which a computer exchanges information with the outside world               Devices that provide input or output to the computer are called peripherals               On a typical personal computer  peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and mouse  and output devices such as the display and printer  Hard disk drives  floppy disk drives and optical disc drives serve as both input and output devices  Computer networking is another form of I O 
I O devices are often complex computers in their own right  with their own CPU and memory  A graphics processing unit might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display  D graphics      citation needed      Modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist the main CPU in performing I O  A      era flat screen display contains its own computer circuitry 

Multitasking
Main article  Computer multitasking
While a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory  in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously  This is achieved by multitasking  i e  having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn               One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt  which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead  By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt  the computer can return to that task later  If several programs are running  at the same time   Then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second  causing a program switch each time  Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception  it may appear that many programs are running at the same time  even though only one is ever executing in any given instant  This method of multitasking is sometimes termed  time sharing  since each program is allocated a  slice  of time in turn              
Before the era of inexpensive computers  the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer  Seemingly  multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly  in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running  but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input output devices to complete their tasks  If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard  then it will not take a  time slice  until the event it is waiting for has occurred  This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss 

Multiprocessing
Main article  Multiprocessing
Cray designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily 
Some computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration  a technique once employed in only large and powerful machines such as supercomputers  mainframe computers and servers  Multiprocessor and multi core  multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit  personal and laptop computers are now widely available  and are being increasingly used in lower end markets as a result 
Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored program architecture and from general purpose computers      g      They often feature thousands of CPUs  customized high speed interconnects  and specialized computing hardware  Such designs tend to be useful for only specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to use most of the available resources at once  Supercomputers usually see usage in large scale simulation  graphics rendering  and cryptography applications  as well as with other so called  embarrassingly parallel  tasks 

Software
Main article  Software
Software refers to parts of the computer which do not have a material form  such as programs  data  protocols  etc  Software is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions  in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built  Computer software includes computer programs  libraries and related non executable data  such as online documentation or digital media  It is often divided into system software and application software  Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own  When software is stored in hardware that cannot easily be modified  such as with BIOS ROM in an IBM PC compatible computer  it is sometimes called  firmware

Programs
The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can be programmed  That is to say that some type of instructions  the program  can be given to the computer  and it will process them  Modern computers based on the von Neumann architecture often have machine code in the form of an imperative programming language  In practical terms  a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions  as do the programs for word processors and web browsers for example  A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second  gigaflops  and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation  Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to write  and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors 

Stored program architecture
Main articles  Computer program and Computer programming
Replica of the Manchester Baby  the world s first electronic stored program computer  at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester  England
This section applies to most common RAM machine based computers 
In most cases  computer instructions are simple  add one number to another  move some data from one location to another  send a message to some external device  etc  These instructions are read from the computer s memory and are generally carried out  executed  in the order they were given  However  there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there  These are called  jump  instructions  or branches   Furthermore  jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event  Many computers directly support subroutines by providing a type of jump that  remembers  the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction 
Program execution might be likened to reading a book  While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence  they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest  Similarly  a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met  This is called the flow of control within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention 
Comparatively  a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses  But to add together all of the numbers from   to       would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time  with a near certainty of making a mistake  On the other hand  a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions  The following example is written in the MIPS assembly language 


  begin 
  addi                       initialize sum to  
  addi                       set first number to add    
  loop 
  slti                       check if the number is less than     
  beq          finish        if odd number is greater than n then exit
  add                        update sum
  addi                       get next number
  j loop                     repeat the summing process
  finish 
  add                        put sum in output register

Once told to run this program  the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention  It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in a fraction of a second 

Machine code
In most computers  individual instructions are stored as machine code with each instruction being given a unique number  its operation code or opcode for short   The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode  the command to multiply them would have a different opcode  and so on  The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions  the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from  each with a unique numerical code  Since the computer s memory is able to store numbers  it can also store the instruction codes  This leads to the important fact that entire programs  which are just lists of these instructions  can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data  The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer s memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann  or stored program  architecture                            In some cases  a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on  This is called the Harvard architecture after the Harvard Mark I computer  Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs  such as in CPU caches 
While it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers  machine language  and while this technique was used with many early computers      h      it is extremely tedious and potentially error prone to do so in practice  especially for complicated programs  Instead  each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember        a mnemonic such as ADD  SUB  MULT or JUMP  These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer s assembly language  Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand  machine language  is usually done by a computer program called an assembler

Programming language
Main article  Programming language
Programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run  Unlike natural languages  programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise  They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud  They are generally either translated into machine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run  or translated directly at run time by an interpreter  Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques 

Low level languages
Main article  Low level programming language
Machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them  collectively termed low level programming languages  are generally unique to the particular architecture of a computer s central processing unit  CPU   For instance  an ARM architecture CPU  such as may be found in a smartphone or a hand held videogame  cannot understand the machine language of an x   CPU that might be in a PC      i      Historically a significant number of other CPU architectures were created and saw extensive use  notably including the MOS Technology      and      in addition to the Zilog Z   

High level languages
Main article  High level programming language
Although considerably easier than in machine language  writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone  Therefore  most practical programs are written in more abstract high level programming languages that are able to express the needs of the programmer more conveniently  and thereby help reduce programmer error   High level languages are usually  compiled  into machine language  or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language  using another computer program called a compiler      j      High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language  and more related to the language and structure of the problem s  to be solved by the final program  It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer  This is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various video game consoles 

Program design
Program design of small programs is relatively simple and involves the analysis of the problem  collection of inputs  using the programming constructs within languages  devising or using established procedures and algorithms  providing data for output devices and solutions to the problem as applicable               As problems become larger and more complex  features such as subprograms  modules  formal documentation  and new paradigms such as object oriented programming are encountered               Large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies               The task of developing large software systems presents a significant intellectual challenge               Producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult               the academic and professional discipline of software engineering concentrates specifically on this challenge              

Bugs
Main article  Software bug
The actual first computer bug  a moth found trapped on a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer
Errors in computer programs are called  bugs   They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program  or have only subtle effects  However  in some cases they may cause the program or the entire system to  hang   becoming unresponsive to input such as mouse clicks or keystrokes  to completely fail  or to crash               Otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an exploit  code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer s proper execution  Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer  Since computers merely execute the instructions they are given  bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program s design      k      Admiral Grace Hopper  an American computer scientist and developer of the first compiler  is credited for having first used the term  bugs  in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in the Harvard Mark II computer in September

In the     s  computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology  The effort was funded by ARPA  now DARPA   and the computer network that resulted was called the ARPANET               The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved  In time  the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet 
The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of computers  Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network  such as peripheral devices  stored information  and the like  as extensions of the resources of an individual computer  Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high tech environments  but in the     s  computer networking become almost ubiquitous  due to the spread of applications like e mail and the World Wide Web  combined with the development of cheap  fast networking technologies like Ethernet and ADSL 
The number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally  A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information   Wireless  networking  often utilizing mobile phone networks  has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments 


Unconventional computers
Main article  Human computer

A computer does not need to be electronic  nor even have a processor  nor RAM  nor even a hard disk  While popular usage of the word  computer  is synonymous with a personal electronic computer      l      a typical modern definition of a computer is   A device that computes  especially a programmable  usually  electronic machine that performs high speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles  stores  correlates  or otherwise processes information                According to this definition  any device that processes information qualifies as a computer 

Future
There is active research to make unconventional computers out of many promising new types of technology  such as optical computers  DNA computers  neural computers  and quantum computers  Most computers are universal  and are able to calculate any computable function  and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed  However different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems  for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms  by quantum factoring  very quickly 

Computer architecture paradigms
There are many types of computer architectures 

Quantum computer vs  Chemical computer
Scalar processor vs  Vector processor
Non Uniform Memory Access  NUMA  computers
Register machine vs  Stack machine
Harvard architecture vs  von Neumann architecture
Cellular architecture
Of all these abstract machines  a quantum computer holds the most promise for revolutionizing computing               Logic gates are a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above digital or analog paradigms  The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely versatile  distinguishing them from calculators  The Church Turing thesis is a mathematical statement of this versatility  any computer with a minimum capability  being Turing complete  is  in principle  capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform  Therefore  any type of computer  netbook  supercomputer  cellular automaton  etc   is able to perform the same computational tasks  given enough time and storage capacity 

Artificial intelligence
A computer will solve problems in exactly the way it is programmed to  without regard to efficiency  alternative solutions  possible shortcuts  or possible errors in the code  Computer programs that learn and adapt are part of the emerging field of artificial intelligence and machine learning  Artificial intelligence based products generally fall into two major categories  rule based systems and pattern recognition systems  Rule based systems attempt to represent the rules used by human experts and tend to be expensive to develop  Pattern based systems use data about a problem to generate conclusions  Examples of pattern based systems include voice recognition  font recognition  translation and the emerging field of on line marketing

Notes


  According to Schmandt Besserat       these clay containers contained tokens  the total of which were the count of objects being transferred  The containers thus served as something of a bill of lading or an accounts book  In order to avoid breaking open the containers  first  clay impressions of the tokens were placed on the outside of the containers  for the count  the shapes of the impressions were abstracted into stylized marks  finally  the abstract marks were systematically used as numerals  these numerals were finally formalized as numbers Eventually the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count  and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count  Schmandt Besserat      estimates it took      years 

  The Intel             die was         mm   composed of      transistors  by comparison  the Pentium Pro was          mm   composed of          million transistors              

  Most major    bit instruction set architectures are extensions of earlier designs  All of the architectures listed in this table  except for Alpha  existed in    bit forms before their    bit incarnations were introduced 

  The control unit s role in interpreting instructions has varied somewhat in the past  Although the control unit is solely responsible for instruction interpretation in most modern computers  this is not always the case  Some computers have instructions that are partially interpreted by the control unit with further interpretation performed by another device  For example  EDVAC  one of the earliest stored program computers  used a central control unit that interpreted only four instructions  All of the arithmetic related instructions were passed on to its arithmetic unit and further decoded there 

  Instructions often occupy more than one memory address  therefore the program counter usually increases by the number of memory locations required to store one instruction 

  Flash memory also may only be rewritten a limited number of times before wearing out  making it less useful for heavy random access usage               

  However  it is also very common to construct supercomputers out of many pieces of cheap commodity hardware  usually individual computers connected by networks  These so called computer clusters can often provide supercomputer performance at a much lower cost than customized designs  While custom architectures are still used for most of the most powerful supercomputers  there has been a proliferation of cluster computers in recent years               

  Even some later computers were commonly programmed directly in machine code  Some minicomputers like the DEC PDP   could be programmed directly from a panel of switches  However  this method was usually used only as part of the booting process  Most modern computers boot entirely automatically by reading a boot program from some non volatile memory 

  However  there is sometimes some form of machine language compatibility between different computers  An x      compatible microprocessor like the AMD Athlon    is able to run most of the same programs that an Intel Core   microprocessor can  as well as programs designed for earlier microprocessors like the Intel Pentiums and Intel        This contrasts with very early commercial computers  which were often one of a kind and totally incompatible with other computers 

  High level languages are also often interpreted rather than compiled  Interpreted languages are translated into machine code on the fly  while running  by another program called an interpreter 

  It is not universally true that bugs are solely due to programmer oversight  Computer hardware may fail or may itself have a fundamental problem that produces unexpected results in certain situations  For instance  the Pentium FDIV bug caused some Intel microprocessors in the early     s to produce inaccurate results for certain floating point division operations  This was caused by a flaw in the microprocessor design and resulted in a partial recall of the affected devices 

  According to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary   th ed         the word computer dates back to the mid   th century  when it referred to  A person who makes calculations  specifically a person employed for this in an observatory etc
