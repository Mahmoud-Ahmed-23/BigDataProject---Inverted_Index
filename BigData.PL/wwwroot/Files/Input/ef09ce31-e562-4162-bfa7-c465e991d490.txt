The Turing test  originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in                  is a test of a machine s ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to that of a human  In the test  a human evaluator judges a text transcript of a natural language conversation between a human and a machine  The evaluator tries to identify the machine  and the machine passes if the evaluator cannot reliably tell them apart  The results would not depend on the machine s ability to answer questions correctly  only on how closely its answers resembled those of a human  Since the Turing test is a test of indistinguishability in performance capacity  the verbal version generalizes naturally to all of human performance capacity  verbal as well as nonverbal  robotic             
The test was introduced by Turing in his      paper  Computing Machinery and Intelligence  while working at the University of Manchester             It opens with the words   I propose to consider the question   Can machines think    Because  thinking  is difficult to define  Turing chooses to  replace the question by another  which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words              Turing describes the new form of the problem in terms of a three person party game called the  imitation game   in which an interrogator asks questions of a man and a woman in another room in order to determine the correct sex of the two players  Turing s new question is   Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game              This question  Turing believed  was one that could actually be answered  In the remainder of the paper  he argued against the major objections to the proposition that  machines can think             
Since Turing introduced his test  it has been highly influential in the philosophy of artificial intelligence  resulting in substantial discussion and controversy  as well as criticism from philosophers like John Searle  who argue against the test s ability to detect consciousness                         
Since the mid     s  several large language models such as ChatGPT have passed modern  rigorous variants of the Turing test                                    


Attempts edit 
Several early symbolic AI programs were controversially claimed to pass the Turing test  either by limiting themselves to scripted situations or by presenting  excuses  for poor reasoning and conversational abilities  such as mental illness or a poor grasp of English                                     
In       Joseph Weizenbaum created a program called ELIZA  which mimicked a Rogerian psychotherapist  The program would search the user s sentence for keywords before repeating them back to the user  providing the impression of a program listening and paying attention              Weizenbaum thus succeeded by designing a context where a chatbot could mimic a person despite  knowing almost nothing of the real world               Weizenbaum s program was able to fool some people into believing that they were talking to a real person             
Kenneth Colby created PARRY in       a program modeled after the behaviour of paranoid schizophrenics              Psychiatrists asked to compare transcripts of conversations generated by the program to those of conversations by actual schizophrenics could only identify about    percent of cases correctly  a figure consistent with random guessing              
In       three programmers developed Eugene Goostman  a chatbot portraying itself as a    year old boy from Odesa who spoke English as a second language  This background was intentionally chosen so judges would forgive mistakes by the program  In a competition      of judges thought Goostman was human

In June       Google s LaMDA model received widespread coverage after claims about it having achieved sentience  Initially in an article in The Economist Google Research Fellow Blaise Ag era y Arcas said the chatbot had demonstrated a degree of understanding of social relationships              Several days later  Google engineer Blake Lemoine claimed in an interview with the Washington Post that LaMDA had achieved sentience  Lemoine had been placed on leave by Google for internal assertions to this effect  Google had investigated the claims but dismissed them                         

ChatGPT edit 
Main article  ChatGPT
OpenAI s chatbot  ChatGPT  released in November       is based on GPT     and GPT   large language models  Celeste Biever wrote in a Nature article that  ChatGPT broke the Turing test               Stanford researchers reported that ChatGPT passes the test  they found that ChatGPT    passes a rigorous Turing test  diverging from average human behavior chiefly to be more cooperative              making it the first computer program to successfully do so             
In late March       a study evaluated four systems  ELIZA  GPT  o  LLaMa        B  and GPT      in two randomized  controlled  and pre registered Turing tests with independent participant groups  Participants engaged in simultaneous   minute conversations with another human participant and one of these systems  then judged which conversational partner they believed to be human  When instructed to adopt a humanlike persona  GPT     was identified as the human     of the time significantly more often than the actual human participants  LLaMa      under the same conditions  was judged to be human     of the time  not significantly more or less often than the humans they were compared to  Baseline models  ELIZA and GPT  o  achieved win rates significantly below chance      and      respectively   These results provide the first empirical evidence that any artificial system passes a standard three party Turing test  The findings have implications for debates about the nature of intelligence exhibited by Large Language Models  LLMs  and the social and economic impacts these systems are likely to have             

History edit 
Philosophical background edit 
The question of whether it is possible for machines to think has a long history  which is firmly entrenched in the distinction between dualist and materialist views of the mind  Ren  Descartes prefigures aspects of the Turing test in his      Discourse on the Method when he writes   H ow many different automata or moving machines could be made by the industry of man          For we can easily understand a machine s being constituted so that it can utter words  and even emit some responses to action on it of a corporeal kind  which brings about a change in its organs  for instance  if touched in a particular part it may ask what we wish to say to it  if in another part it may exclaim that it is being hurt  and so on  But it never happens that it arranges its speech in various ways  in order to reply appropriately to everything that may be said in its presence  as even the lowest type of man can do             
Here Descartes notes that automata are capable of responding to human interactions but argues that such automata cannot respond appropriately to things said in their presence in the way that any human can  Descartes therefore prefigures the Turing test by defining the insufficiency of appropriate linguistic response as that which separates the human from the automaton  Descartes fails to consider the possibility that future automata might be able to overcome such insufficiency  and so does not propose the Turing test as such  even if he prefigures its conceptual framework and criterion 
Denis Diderot formulates in his      book Pens es philosophiques a Turing test criterion  though with the important implicit limiting assumption maintained  of the participants being natural living beings  rather than considering created artifacts 

If they find a parrot who could answer to everything  I would claim it to be an intelligent being without hesitation 
This does not mean he agrees with this  but that it was already a common argument of materialists at that time 
According to dualism  the mind is non physical  or  at the very least  has non physical properties              and  therefore  cannot be explained in purely physical terms  According to materialism  the mind can be explained physically  which leaves open the possibility of minds that are produced artificially             
In       philosopher Alfred Ayer considered the standard philosophical question of other minds  how do we know that other people have the same conscious experiences that we do  In his book  Language  Truth and Logic  Ayer suggested a protocol to distinguish between a conscious man and an unconscious machine   The only ground I can have for asserting that an object which appears to be conscious is not really a conscious being  but only a dummy or a machine  is that it fails to satisfy one of the empirical tests by which the presence or absence of consciousness is determined                This suggestion is very similar to the Turing test  but it is not certain that Ayer s popular philosophical classic was familiar to Turing   In other words  a thing is not conscious if it fails the consciousness test 

Cultural background edit 
A rudimentary idea of the Turing test appears in the      novel Gulliver s Travels by Jonathan Swift                          When Gulliver is brought before the king of Brobdingnag  the king thinks at first that Gulliver might be a  a piece of clock work  which is in that country arrived to a very great perfection  contrived by some ingenious artist   Even when he hears Gulliver speaking  the king still doubts whether Gulliver was taught  a set of words  to make him  sell at a better price   Gulliver tells that only after  he put several other questions to me  and still received rational answers  the king became satisfied that Gulliver was not a machine             
Tests where a human judges whether a computer or an alien is intelligent were an established convention in science fiction by the     s  and it is likely that Turing would have been aware of these              Stanley G  Weinbaum s  A Martian Odyssey         provides an example of how nuanced such tests could be             
Earlier examples of machines or automatons attempting to pass as human include the Ancient Greek myth of Pygmalion who creates a sculpture of a woman that is animated by Aphrodite  Carlo Collodi s novel The Adventures of Pinocchio  about a puppet who wants to become a real boy  and E  T  A  Hoffmann s      story  The Sandman   where the protagonist falls in love with an automaton  In all these examples  people are fooled by artificial beings that   up to a point   pass as human             

Alan Turing and the Imitation Game edit 
Researchers in the United Kingdom had been exploring  machine intelligence  for up to ten years prior to the founding of the field of artificial intelligence  AI  research in                   It was a common topic among the members of the Ratio Club  an informal group of British cybernetics and electronics researchers that included Alan Turing             
Turing  in particular  had been running the notion of machine intelligence since at least                  and one of the earliest known mentions of  computer intelligence  was made by him in                   In Turing s report   Intelligent Machinery               he investigated  the question of whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour              and  as part of that investigation  proposed what may be considered the forerunner to his later tests 

It is not difficult to devise a paper machine which will play a not very bad game of chess              Now get three men A  B and C as subjects for the experiment  A and C are to be rather poor chess players  B is the operator who works the paper machine      Two rooms are used with some arrangement for communicating moves  and a game is played between C and either A or the paper machine  C may find it quite difficult to tell which he is playing             
 Computing Machinery and Intelligence         was the first published paper by Turing to focus exclusively on machine intelligence  Turing begins the      paper with the claim   I propose to consider the question  Can machines think               As he highlights  the traditional approach to such a question is to start with definitions  defining both the terms  machine  and  think   Turing chooses not to do so  instead  he replaces the question with a new one   which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words              In essence he proposes to change the question from  Can machines think   to  Can machines do what we  as thinking entities  can do               The advantage of the new question  Turing argues  is that it draws  a fairly sharp line between the physical and intellectual capacities of a man              
To demonstrate this approach Turing proposes a test inspired by a party game  known as the  imitation game   in which a man and a woman go into separate rooms and guests try to tell them apart by writing a series of questions and reading the typewritten answers sent back  In this game  both the man and the woman aim to convince the guests that they are the other   Huma Shah argues that this two human version of the game was presented by Turing only to introduce the reader to the machine human question answer test               Turing described his new version of the game as follows 

We now ask the question   What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game   Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman  These questions replace our original   Can machines think              
Later in the paper  Turing suggests an  equivalent  alternative formulation involving a judge conversing only with a computer and a man              While neither of these formulations precisely matches the version of the Turing test that is more generally known today  he proposed a third in       In this version  which Turing discussed in a BBC radio broadcast  a jury asks questions of a computer and the role of the computer is to make a significant proportion of the jury believe that it is really a man             
Turing s paper considered nine putative objections  which include some of the major arguments against artificial intelligence that have been raised in the years since the paper was published  see  Computing Machinery and Intelligence              

The Chinese room edit 
Main article  Chinese room
John Searle s      paper Minds  Brains  and Programs proposed the  Chinese room  thought experiment and argued that the Turing test could not be used to determine if a machine could think  Searle noted that software  such as ELIZA  could pass the Turing test simply by manipulating symbols of which they had no understanding  Without understanding  they could not be described as  thinking  in the same sense people did  Therefore  Searle concluded  the Turing test could not prove that machines could think              Much like the Turing test itself  Searle s argument has been both widely criticised             and endorsed             
Arguments such as Searle s and others working on the philosophy of mind sparked off a more intense debate about the nature of intelligence  the possibility of machines with a conscious mind and the value of the Turing test that continued through the     s and     s             

Loebner Prize edit 
Main article  Loebner Prize
The Loebner Prize  now reported as defunct              provided an annual platform for practical Turing tests with the first competition held in November                   It was underwritten by Hugh Loebner  The Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies in Massachusetts  United States  organised the prizes up to and including the      contest  As Loebner described it  one reason the competition was created is to advance the state of AI research  at least in part  because no one had taken steps to implement the Turing test despite    years of discussing it             
The first Loebner Prize competition in      led to a renewed discussion of the viability of the Turing test and the value of pursuing it  in both the popular press             and academia              The first contest was won by a mindless program with no identifiable intelligence that managed to fool na ve interrogators into making the wrong identification  This highlighted several of the shortcomings of the Turing test  discussed below   The winner won  at least in part  because it was able to  imitate human typing errors               the unsophisticated interrogators were easily fooled              and some researchers in AI have been led to feel that the test is merely a distraction from more fruitful research             
The silver  text only  and gold  audio and visual  prizes have never been won  However  the competition has awarded the bronze medal every year for the computer system that  in the judges  opinions  demonstrates the  most human  conversational behaviour among that year s entries  Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity  A L I C E   has won the bronze award on three occasions in recent times                     Learning AI Jabberwacky won in      and      
The Loebner Prize tested conversational intelligence  winners were typically chatterbot programs  or Artificial Conversational Entities  ACE s  Early Loebner Prize rules restricted conversations  Each entry and hidden human conversed on a single topic              thus the interrogators were restricted to one line of questioning per entity interaction  The restricted conversation rule was lifted for the      Loebner Prize  Interaction duration between judge and entity has varied in Loebner Prizes  In Loebner       at the University of Surrey  each interrogator was allowed five minutes to interact with an entity  machine or hidden human  Between      and       the interaction time allowed in Loebner Prizes was more than twenty minutes  The final competition was in       due to a lack of funding for the prize following Loebner s death in                  

CAPTCHA edit 
Main article  CAPTCHA
CAPTCHA  Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart  is one of the oldest concepts for artificial intelligence  The CAPTCHA system is commonly used online to tell humans and bots apart on the internet  It is based on the Turing test  Displaying distorted letters and numbers  it asks the user to identify the letters and numbers and type them into a field  which bots struggle to do                         
The reCaptcha is a CAPTCHA system owned by Google  The reCaptcha v  and v  both used to operate by asking the user to match distorted pictures or identify distorted letters and numbers  The reCaptcha v  is designed to not interrupt users and run automatically when pages are loaded or buttons are clicked  This  invisible  CAPTCHA verification happens in the background and no challenges appear  which filters out most basic bots                         

Versions edit 
The imitation game  as described by Alan Turing in  Computing Machinery and Intelligence   Player C  through a series of written questions  attempts to determine which of the other two players is a man  and which of the two is the woman  Player A  the man  tries to trick player C into making the wrong decision  while player B tries to help player C  Figure adapted from Saygin                  
Saul Traiger argues that there are at least three primary versions of the Turing test  two of which are offered in  Computing Machinery and Intelligence  and one that he describes as the  Standard Interpretation               While there is some debate regarding whether the  Standard Interpretation  is that described by Turing or  instead  based on a misreading of his paper  these three versions are not regarded as equivalent              and their strengths and weaknesses are distinct             
Turing s original article describes a simple party game involving three players  Player A is a man  player B is a woman and player C  who plays the role of the interrogator  is of either gender  In the imitation game  player C is unable to see either player A or player B  and can communicate with them only through written notes  By asking questions of player A and player B  player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman  Player A s role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision  while player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the right one            
Turing then asks 

 What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game  Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman   These questions replace our original   Can machines think              
The original imitation game test  in which the player A is replaced with a computer  The computer is now charged with the role of the man  while player B continues to attempt to assist the interrogator  Figure adapted from Saygin                  
The second version appeared later in Turing s      paper  Similar to the original imitation game test  the role of player A is performed by a computer  However  the role of player B is performed by a man rather than a woman 

Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C  Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage  suitably increasing its speed of action  and providing it with an appropriate programme  C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game  the part of B being taken by a man             
In this version  both player A  the computer  and player B are trying to trick the interrogator into making an incorrect decision 
The standard interpretation is not included in the original paper  but is both accepted and debated 
Common understanding has it that the purpose of the Turing test is not specifically to determine whether a computer is able to fool an interrogator into believing that it is a human  but rather whether a computer could imitate a human             While there is some dispute whether this interpretation was intended by Turing  Sterrett believes that it was             and thus conflates the second version with this one  while others  such as Traiger  do not                    this has nevertheless led to what can be viewed as the  standard interpretation   In this version  player A is a computer and player B a person of either sex  The role of the interrogator is not to determine which is male and which is female  but which is a computer and which is a human              The fundamental issue with the standard interpretation is that the interrogator cannot differentiate which responder is human  and which is machine  There are issues about duration  but the standard interpretation generally considers this limitation as something that should be reasonable 

Interpretations edit 
Controversy has arisen over which of the alternative formulations of the test Turing intended              Sterrett argues that two distinct tests can be extracted from his      paper and that  pace Turing s remark  they are not equivalent  The test that employs the party game and compares frequencies of success is referred to as the  Original Imitation Game Test   whereas the test consisting of a human judge conversing with a human and a machine is referred to as the  Standard Turing Test   noting that Sterrett equates this with the  standard interpretation  rather than the second version of the imitation game  Sterrett agrees that the standard Turing test  STT  has the problems that its critics cite but feels that  in contrast  the original imitation game test  OIG test  so defined is immune to many of them  due to a crucial difference  Unlike the STT  it does not make similarity to human performance the criterion  even though it employs human performance in setting a criterion for machine intelligence  A man can fail the OIG test  but it is argued that it is a virtue of a test of intelligence that failure indicates a lack of resourcefulness  The OIG test requires the resourcefulness associated with intelligence and not merely  simulation of human conversational behaviour   The general structure of the OIG test could even be used with non verbal versions of imitation games             
According to Huma Shah  Turing himself was concerned with whether a machine could think and was providing a simple method to examine this  through human machine question answer sessions              Shah argues the imitation game which Turing described could be practicalized in two different ways  a  one to one interrogator machine test  and b  simultaneous comparison of a machine with a human  both questioned in parallel by an interrogator             
Still other writers             have interpreted Turing as proposing that the imitation game itself is the test  without specifying how to take into account Turing s statement that the test that he proposed using the party version of the imitation game is based upon a criterion of comparative frequency of success in that imitation game  rather than a capacity to succeed at one round of the game 

Some writers argue that the imitation game is best understood by its social aspects  In his      paper  Turing refers to intelligence as an  emotional concept   and notes that The extent to which we regard something as behaving in an intelligent manner is determined as much by our own state of mind and training as by the properties of the object under consideration  If we are able to explain and predict its behaviour or if there seems to be little underlying plan  we have little temptation to imagine intelligence  With the same object therefore it is possible that one man would consider it as intelligent and another would not  the second man would have found out the rules of its behaviour             Following this remark and similar ones scattered throughout Turing s publications  Diane Proudfoot             claims that Turing held a response dependence approach to intelligence  according to which an intelligent  or thinking  entity is one that appears intelligent to an average interrogator  Shlomo Danziger             promotes a socio technological interpretation  according to which Turing saw the imitation game not as an intelligence test but as a technological aspiration   one whose realization would likely involve a change in society s attitude toward machines  According to this reading  Turing s celebrated    year prediction   that by the end of the   th century his test will be passed by some machine   actually consists of two distinguishable predictions  The first is a technological prediction I believe that in about fifty years  time it will be possible to programme computers     to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than     chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning             The second prediction Turing makes is a sociological one I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted             Danziger claims further that for Turing  alteration of society s attitude towards machinery is a prerequisite for the existence of intelligent machines  Only when the term  intelligent machine  is no longer seen as an oxymoron the existence of intelligent machines would become logically possible 
Saygin has suggested that maybe the original game is a way of proposing a less biased experimental design as it hides the participation of the computer              The imitation game also includes a  social hack  not found in the standard interpretation  as in the game both computer and male human are required to play as pretending to be someone they are not             

Should the interrogator know about the computer  edit 
A crucial piece of any laboratory test is that there should be a control  Turing never makes clear whether the interrogator in his tests is aware that one of the participants is a computer  He states only that player A is to be replaced with a machine  not that player C is to be made aware of this replacement              When Colby  FD Hilf  S Weber and AD Kramer tested PARRY  they did so by assuming that the interrogators did not need to know that one or more of those being interviewed was a computer during the interrogation              As Ayse Saygin  Peter Swirski              and others have highlighted  this makes a big difference to the implementation and outcome of the test             An experimental study looking at Gricean maxim violations using transcripts of Loebner s one to one  interrogator hidden interlocutor  Prize for AI contests between      and       Ayse Saygin found significant differences between the responses of participants who knew and did not know about computers being involved             

Strengths edit 
Tractability and simplicity edit 
The power and appeal of the Turing test derives from its simplicity  The philosophy of mind  psychology  and modern neuroscience have been unable to provide definitions of  intelligence  and  thinking  that are sufficiently precise and general to be applied to machines  Without such definitions  the central questions of the philosophy of artificial intelligence cannot be answered  The Turing test  even if imperfect  at least provides something that can actually be measured  As such  it is a pragmatic attempt to answer a difficult philosophical question 

Breadth of subject matter edit 
The format of the test allows the interrogator to give the machine a wide variety of intellectual tasks  Turing wrote that  the question and answer method seems to be suitable for introducing almost any one of the fields of human endeavour that we wish to include               John Haugeland adds that  understanding the words is not enough  you have to understand the topic as well              
To pass a well designed Turing test  the machine must use natural language  reason  have knowledge and learn  The test can be extended to include video input  as well as a  hatch  through which objects can be passed  this would force the machine to demonstrate skilled use of well designed vision and robotics as well  Together  these represent almost all of the major problems that artificial intelligence research would like to solve             
The Feigenbaum test is designed to take advantage of the broad range of topics available to a Turing test  It is a limited form of Turing s question answer game which compares the machine against the abilities of experts in specific fields such as literature or chemistry 

Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence edit 
As a Cambridge honours graduate in mathematics  Turing might have been expected to propose a test of computer intelligence requiring expert knowledge in some highly technical field  and thus anticipating a more recent approach to the subject  Instead  as already noted  the test which he described in his seminal      paper requires the computer to be able to compete successfully in a common party game  and this by performing as well as the typical man in answering a series of questions so as to pretend convincingly to be the woman contestant 
Given the status of human sexual dimorphism as one of the most ancient of subjects  it is thus implicit in the above scenario that the questions to be answered will involve neither specialised factual knowledge nor information processing technique  The challenge for the computer  rather  will be to demonstrate empathy for the role of the female  and to demonstrate as well a characteristic aesthetic sensibility both of which qualities are on display in this snippet of dialogue which Turing has imagined 

Interrogator  Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair 
Contestant  My hair is shingled  and the longest strands are about nine inches long 
When Turing does introduce some specialised knowledge into one of his imagined dialogues  the subject is not maths or electronics  but poetry 

Interrogator  In the first line of your sonnet which reads   Shall I compare thee to a summer s day   would not  a spring day  do as well or better

Witness  Yes  but nobody wants to be compared to a winter s day 
Turing thus once again demonstrates his interest in empathy and aesthetic sensitivity as components of an artificial intelligence  and in light of an increasing awareness of the threat from an AI run amok              it has been suggested             that this focus perhaps represents a critical intuition on Turing s part  i e   that emotional and aesthetic intelligence will play a key role in the creation of a  friendly AI   It is further noted  however  that whatever inspiration Turing might be able to lend in this direction depends upon the preservation of his original vision  which is to say  further  that the promulgation of a  standard interpretation  of the Turing test i e   one which focuses on a discursive intelligence only must be regarded with some caution 

Weaknesses edit 
Turing did not explicitly state that the Turing test could be used as a measure of  intelligence   or any other human quality  He wanted to provide a clear and understandable alternative to the word  think   which he could then use to reply to criticisms of the possibility of  thinking machines  and to suggest ways that research might move forward 
Nevertheless  the Turing test has been proposed as a measure of a machine s  ability to think  or its  intelligence   This proposal has received criticism from both philosophers and computer scientists  The interpretation makes the assumption that an interrogator can determine if a machine is  thinking  by comparing its behaviour with human behaviour  Every element of this assumption has been questioned  the reliability of the interrogator s judgement  the value of comparing the machine with a human  and the value of comparing only behaviour  Because of these and other considerations  some AI researchers have questioned the relevance of the test to their field 

Na vet  of interrogators edit 
In practice  the test s results can easily be dominated not by the computer s intelligence  but by the attitudes  skill  or na vet  of the questioner  Numerous experts in the field  including cognitive scientist Gary Marcus  insist that the Turing test only shows how easy it is to fool humans and is not an indication of machine intelligence             
Turing doesn t specify the precise skills and knowledge required by the interrogator in his description of the test  but he did use the term  average interrogator     the  average interrogator would not have more than    per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning              
Chatterbot programs such as ELIZA have repeatedly fooled unsuspecting people into believing that they are communicating with human beings  In these cases  the  interrogators  are not even aware of the possibility that they are interacting with computers  To successfully appear human  there is no need for the machine to have any intelligence whatsoever and only a superficial resemblance to human behaviour is required 
Early Loebner Prize competitions used  unsophisticated  interrogators who were easily fooled by the machines              Since       the Loebner Prize organisers have deployed philosophers  computer scientists  and journalists among the interrogators  Nonetheless  some of these experts have been deceived by the machines             
One interesting feature of the Turing test is the frequency of the confederate effect  when the confederate  tested  humans are misidentified by the interrogators as machines  It has been suggested that what interrogators expect as human responses is not necessarily typical of humans  As a result  some individuals can be categorised as machines  This can therefore work in favour of a competing machine  The humans are instructed to  act themselves   but sometimes their answers are more like what the interrogator expects a machine to say              This raises the question of how to ensure that the humans are motivated to  act human  

Human intelligence vs  intelligence in general edit 

The Turing test does not directly test whether the computer behaves intelligently  It tests only whether the computer behaves like a human being  Since human behaviour and intelligent behaviour are not exactly the same thing  the test can fail to accurately measure intelligence in two ways 

Some human behaviour is unintelligent
The Turing test requires that the machine be able to execute all human behaviours  regardless of whether they are intelligent  It even tests for behaviours that may not be considered intelligent at all  such as the susceptibility to insults              the temptation to lie or  simply  a high frequency of typing mistakes  If a machine cannot imitate these unintelligent behaviours in detail it fails the test 
This objection was raised by The Economist  in an article entitled  artificial stupidity  published shortly after the first Loebner Prize competition in       The article noted that the first Loebner winner s victory was due  at least in part  to its ability to  imitate human typing errors               Turing himself had suggested that programs add errors into their output  so as to be better  players  of the game             
Some intelligent behaviour is inhuman
The Turing test does not test for highly intelligent behaviours  such as the ability to solve difficult problems or come up with original insights  In fact  it specifically requires deception on the part of the machine  if the machine is more intelligent than a human being it must deliberately avoid appearing too intelligent  If it were to solve a computational problem that is practically impossible for a human to solve  then the interrogator would know the program is not human  and the machine would fail the test 
Because it cannot measure intelligence that is beyond the ability of humans  the test cannot be used to build or evaluate systems that are more intelligent than humans  Because of this  several test alternatives that would be able to evaluate super intelligent systems have been proposed             
Consciousness vs  the simulation of consciousness edit 
Main article  Chinese room
See also  Synthetic intelligence
The Turing test is concerned strictly with how the subject acts        the external behaviour of the machine  In this regard  it takes a behaviourist or functionalist approach to the study of the mind  The example of ELIZA suggests that a machine passing the test may be able to simulate human conversational behaviour by following a simple  but large  list of mechanical rules  without thinking or having a mind at all 
John Searle has argued that external behaviour cannot be used to determine if a machine is  actually  thinking or merely  simulating thinking               His Chinese room argument is intended to show that  even if the Turing test is a good operational definition of intelligence  it may not indicate that the machine has a mind  consciousness  or intentionality   Intentionality is a philosophical term for the power of thoughts to be  about  something  

Turing anticipated this line of criticism in his original paper              writing  I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness  There is  for instance  something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it  But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper              
Impracticality and irrelevance  the Turing test and AI research edit 
GPT   talkbot attempt
Mainstream AI researchers argue that trying to pass the Turing test is merely a distraction from more fruitful research              Indeed  the Turing test is not an active focus of much academic or commercial effort as Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig write   AI researchers have devoted little attention to passing the Turing test               There are several reasons 
First  there are easier ways to test their programs  Most current research in AI related fields is aimed at modest and specific goals  such as object recognition or logistics  To test the intelligence of the programs that solve these problems  AI researchers simply give them the task directly  Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig suggest an analogy with the history of flight  Planes are tested by how well they fly  not by comparing them to birds   Aeronautical engineering texts   they write   do not define the goal of their field as  making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons               
Second  creating lifelike simulations of human beings is a difficult problem on its own that does not need to be solved to achieve the basic goals of AI research  Believable human characters may be interesting in a work of art  a game  or a sophisticated user interface  but they are not part of the science of creating intelligent machines  that is  machines that solve problems using intelligence 
Turing did not intend for his idea to be used to test the intelligence of programs       he wanted to provide a clear and understandable example to aid in the discussion of the philosophy of artificial intelligence              John McCarthy argues that we should not be surprised that a philosophical idea turns out to be useless for practical applications  He observes that the philosophy of AI is  unlikely to have any more effect on the practice of AI research than philosophy of science generally has on the practice of science                          

The language centric objection edit 
Another well known objection raised towards the Turing test concerns its exclusive focus on linguistic behaviour  i e  it is only a  language based  experiment  while all the other cognitive faculties are not tested   This drawback downsizes the role of other modality specific  intelligent abilities  concerning human beings that the psychologist Howard Gardner  in his  multiple intelligence theory   proposes to consider  verbal linguistic abilities are only one of those              

Silence edit 
A critical aspect of the Turing test is that a machine must give itself away as being a machine by its utterances  An interrogator must then make the  right identification  by correctly identifying the machine as being just that  If  however  a machine remains silent during a conversation  then it is not possible for an interrogator to accurately identify the machine other than by means of a calculated guess             
Even taking into account a parallel hidden human as part of the test may not help the situation as humans can often be misidentified as being a machine             

The Turing Trap edit 
By focusing on imitating humans  rather than augmenting or extending human capabilities  the Turing Test risks directing research and implementation toward technologies that substitute for humans and thereby drive down wages and income for workers  As they lose economic power  these workers may also lose political power  making it more difficult for them to change the allocation of wealth and income  This can trap them in a bad equilibrium  Erik Brynjolfsson has called this  The Turing Trap              and argued that there are currently excess incentives for creating machines that imitate rather than augment humans 

Variations edit 
Numerous other versions of the Turing test  including those expounded above  have been raised through the years 

Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA edit 
Main articles  Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA
A modification of the Turing test wherein the objective of one or more of the roles have been reversed between machines and humans is termed a reverse Turing test  An example is implied in the work of psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion              who was particularly fascinated by the  storm  that resulted from the encounter of one mind by another  In his      book              among several other original points with regard to the Turing test  literary scholar Peter Swirski discussed in detail the idea of what he termed the Swirski test essentially the reverse Turing test  He pointed out that it overcomes most if not all standard objections levelled at the standard version 
Carrying this idea forward  R  D  Hinshelwood              described the mind as a  mind recognizing apparatus   The challenge would be for the computer to be able to determine if it were interacting with a human or another computer  This is an extension of the original question that Turing attempted to answer but would  perhaps  offer a high enough standard to define a machine that could  think  in a way that we typically define as characteristically human 
CAPTCHA is a form of reverse Turing test  Before being allowed to perform some action on a website  the user is presented with alphanumerical characters in a distorted graphic image and asked to type them out  This is intended to prevent automated systems from being used to abuse the site  The rationale is that software sufficiently sophisticated to read and reproduce the distorted image accurately does not exist  or is not available to the average user   so any system able to do so is likely to be a human 
Software that could reverse CAPTCHA with some accuracy by analysing patterns in the generating engine started being developed soon after the creation of CAPTCHA              
In       researchers at Vicarious announced that they had developed a system to solve CAPTCHA challenges from Google  Yahoo   and PayPal up to     of the time              
In       Google engineers demonstrated a system that could defeat CAPTCHA challenges with       accuracy              
In       Shuman Ghosemajumder  former click fraud czar of Google  stated that there were cybercriminal sites that would defeat CAPTCHA challenges for a fee  to enable various forms of fraud              

Distinguishing accurate use of language from actual understanding edit 
A further variation is motivated by the concern that modern Natural Language Processing prove to be highly successful in generating text on the basis of a huge text corpus and could eventually pass the Turing test simply by manipulating words and sentences that have been used in the initial training of the model  Since the interrogator has no precise understanding of the training data  the model might simply be returning sentences that exist in similar fashion in the enormous amount of training data  For this reason  Arthur Schwaninger proposes a variation of the Turing test that can distinguish between systems that are only capable of using language and systems that understand language  He proposes a test in which the machine is confronted with philosophical questions that do not depend on any prior knowledge and yet require self reflection to be answered appropriately              

Subject matter expert Turing test edit 
Main article  Subject matter expert Turing test
Another variation is described as the subject matter expert Turing test  where a machine s response cannot be distinguished from an expert in a given field  This is also known as a  Feigenbaum test  and was proposed by Edward Feigenbaum in a      paper              

 Low level  cognition test edit 
Robert French        makes the case that an interrogator can distinguish human and non human interlocutors by posing questions that reveal the low level  i e   unconscious  processes of human cognition  as studied by cognitive science  Such questions reveal the precise details of the human embodiment of thought and can unmask a computer unless it experiences the world as humans do              

Total Turing test edit 
The  Total Turing test             variation of the Turing test  proposed by cognitive scientist Stevan Harnad               adds two further requirements to the traditional Turing test  The interrogator can also test the perceptual abilities of the subject  requiring computer vision  and the subject s ability to manipulate objects  requiring robotics               

Electronic health records edit 
A letter published in Communications of the ACM              describes the concept of generating a synthetic patient population and proposes a variation of Turing test to assess the difference between synthetic and real patients  The letter states   In the EHR context  though a human physician can readily distinguish between synthetically generated and real live human patients  could a machine be given the intelligence to make such a determination on its own   and further the letter states   Before synthetic patient identities become a public health problem  the legitimate EHR market might benefit from applying Turing Test like techniques to ensure greater data reliability and diagnostic value  Any new techniques must thus consider patients  heterogeneity and are likely to have greater complexity than the Allen eighth grade science test is able to grade  

Minimum intelligent signal test edit 
Main article  Minimum intelligent signal test
The minimum intelligent signal test was proposed by Chris McKinstry as  the maximum abstraction of the Turing test                in which only binary responses  true false or yes no  are permitted  to focus only on the capacity for thought  It eliminates text chat problems like anthropomorphism bias  and does not require emulation of unintelligent human behaviour  allowing for systems that exceed human intelligence  The questions must each stand on their own  however  making it more like an IQ test than an interrogation  It is typically used to gather statistical data against which the performance of artificial intelligence programs may be measured              

Hutter Prize edit 
The organisers of the Hutter Prize believe that compressing natural language text is a hard AI problem  equivalent to passing the Turing test  The data compression test has some advantages over most versions and variations of a Turing test  including      citation needed     

It gives a single number that can be directly used to compare which of two machines is  more intelligent  
It does not require the computer to lie to the judge
The main disadvantages of using data compression as a test are 

It is not possible to test humans this way 
It is unknown what particular  score  on this test if any is equivalent to passing a human level Turing test 
Other tests based on compression or Kolmogorov complexity edit 
A related approach to Hutter s prize which appeared much earlier in the late     s is the inclusion of compression problems in an extended Turing test               or by tests which are completely derived from Kolmogorov complexity              
Other related tests in this line are presented by Hernandez Orallo and Dowe              
Algorithmic IQ  or AIQ for short  is an attempt to convert the theoretical Universal Intelligence Measure from Legg and Hutter  based on Solomonoff s inductive inference  into a working practical test of machine intelligence              
Two major advantages of some of these tests are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers 

Ebert test edit 
The Turing test inspired the Ebert test proposed in      by film critic Roger Ebert which is a test whether a computer based synthesised voice has sufficient skill in terms of intonations  inflections  timing and so forth  to make people laugh              

Social Turing game edit 
Taking advantage of large language models  in      the research company AI   Labs created an online social experiment titled  Human or Not                              It was played more than    million times by more than   million people               It is the biggest Turing style experiment to that date  The results showed that     of people could not distinguish between humans and machines                           

Conferences edit 
Turing Colloquium edit 
     marked the fortieth anniversary of the first publication of Turing s  Computing Machinery and Intelligence  paper  and saw renewed interest in the test  Two significant events occurred in that year  the first was the Turing Colloquium  which was held at the University of Sussex in April  and brought together academics and researchers from a wide variety of disciplines to discuss the Turing test in terms of its past  present  and future  the second was the formation of the annual Loebner Prize competition 
Blay Whitby lists four major turning points in the history of the Turing test        the publication of  Computing Machinery and Intelligence  in       the announcement of Joseph Weizenbaum s ELIZA in       Kenneth Colby s creation of PARRY  which was first described in       and the Turing Colloquium in                   

     AISB Symposium edit 
In parallel to the      Loebner Prize held at the University of Reading              
the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour  AISB   hosted a one day symposium to discuss the Turing test  organised by John Barnden  Mark Bishop  Huma Shah and Kevin Warwick              
The speakers included the Royal Institution s Director Baroness Susan Greenfield  Selmer Bringsjord  Turing s biographer Andrew Hodges  and consciousness scientist Owen Holland  No agreement emerged for a canonical Turing test  though Bringsjord expressed that a sizeable prize would result in the Turing test being passed sooner
