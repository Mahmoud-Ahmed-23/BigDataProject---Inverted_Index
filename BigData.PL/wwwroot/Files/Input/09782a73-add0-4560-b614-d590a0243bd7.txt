Artificial intelligence detection software aims to determine whether some content  text  image  video or audio  was generated using artificial intelligence  AI  
However  the reliability of such software is a topic of debate             and there are concerns about the potential misapplication of AI detection software by educators 


Accuracy issues edit 
Multiple AI detection tools have been demonstrated to be unreliable in terms of accurately and comprehensively detecting AI generated text  In a study conducted by Weber Wulff et al  and published in       researchers evaluated    detection tools including Turnitin and GPT Zero and found that  all scored below     of accuracy and only   over                 

False positives and false negatives edit 
In AI content detection  a false positive is when human written work is incorrectly flagged as AI written  Many AI detection software claim to have a minimal level of false positives  with Turnitin claiming a less than    false positive rate             However  later research by The Washington Post produced much higher rates of      though they used a smaller sample size             False positives in an academic setting frequently lead to accusations of academic misconduct  which can have serious consequences for a student s academic record  Additionally  studies have shown evidence that many AI detection models are prone to give false positives to work written by those whose first language isn t English and neurodiverse people                       
A false negative is a failure to identify documents with AI written text  False negatives often happen as a result of a detection software s sensitivity level or because evasive techniques were used when generating the work to make it sound more human             False negatives are less of a concern academically  since they aren t likely to lead to accusations and ramifications  Notably  Turnitin stated they have a     false negative rate            

Text detection edit 
For text  this is usually done to prevent alleged plagiarism  often by detecting repetition of words as telltale signs that a text was AI generated  including AI hallucinations   They are often used by teachers marking their students  usually on an ad hoc basis  Following the release of ChatGPT and similar AI text generative software  many educational establishments have issued policies against the use of AI by students             AI text detection software is also used by those assessing job applicants  as well as online search engines             
Current detectors may sometimes be unreliable and have incorrectly marked work by humans as originating from AI                                     while failing to detect AI generated work in other instances              MIT Technology Review said that the technology  struggled to pick up ChatGPT generated text that had been slightly rearranged by humans and obfuscated by a paraphrasing tool               AI text detection software has also been shown to discriminate against non native speakers of English             
Two students from the University of California  Davis  were referred to the university s Office of Student Success and Judicial Affairs  OSSJA  after their professors scanned their essays with positive results  the first with an AI detector called GPTZero  and the second with an AI detector integration in Turnitin  However  following media coverage              and a thorough investigation  the students were cleared of any wrongdoing                         
In April       Cambridge University and other members of the Russell Group of universities in the United Kingdom opted out of Turnitin s AI text detection tool  after expressing concerns it was unreliable              The University of Texas at Austin opted out of the system six months later             
In May       a professor at Texas A amp M University Commerce used ChatGPT to detect whether his students  content was written by it  which ChatGPT said was the case  As such  he threatened to fail the class despite ChatGPT not being able to detect AI generated writing              No students were prevented from graduating because of the issue  and all but one student  who admitted to using the software  were exonerated from accusations of having used ChatGPT in their content             
An article by Thomas Germain  published on Gizmodo in June       reported job losses among freelance writers and journalists due to AI text detection software mistakenly classifying their work as AI generated             
To improve the reliability of AI text detection  researchers have explored digital watermarking techniques  A      paper titled  A Watermark for Large Language Models               presents a method to embed imperceptible watermarks into text generated by large language models  LLMs   This watermarking approach allows content to be flagged as AI generated with a high level of accuracy  even when text is slightly paraphrased or modified  The technique is designed to be subtle and hard to detect for casual readers  thereby preserving readability  while providing a detectable signal for those employing specialized tools  However  while promising  watermarking faces challenges in remaining robust under adversarial transformations and ensuring compatibility across different LLMs 

Anti text detection edit 
There is software available designed to bypass AI text detection             
A study published in August      analyzed    abstracts from papers published in the Eye Journal  which were then paraphrased using GPT      The AI paraphrased abstracts were examined for plagiarism using QueText and for AI generated content using Originality AI  The texts were then re processed through an adversarial software called Undetectable ai in order to reduce the AI detection scores  The study found that the AI detection tool  Originality AI  identified text generated by GPT   with a mean accuracy of        However  after reprocessing by Undetectable ai  the detection accuracy of Originality ai dropped to a mean accuracy of                               
Some experts also believe that techniques like digital watermarking are ineffective because they can be removed or added to trigger false positives               A Watermark for Large Language Models  paper by Kirchenbauer et al               also addresses potential vulnerabilities of watermarking techniques  The authors outline a range of adversarial tactics  including text insertion  deletion  and substitution attacks  that could be used to bypass watermark detection  These attacks vary in complexity  from simple paraphrasing to more sophisticated approaches involving tokenization and homoglyph alterations  The study highlights the challenge of maintaining watermark robustness against attackers who may employ automated paraphrasing tools or even specific language model replacements to alter text spans iteratively while retaining semantic similarity  Experimental results show that although such attacks can degrade watermark strength  they also come at the cost of text quality and increased computational resources 

Multilingual text detection edit 
One shortcoming of most AI content detection software is their inability to identify AI generated text in any language  Large language models  LLMs  like ChatGPT  Claude  and Gemini can write in different languages  but traditional AI text detection tools have primarily been trained in English and a few other widely spoken languages  such as French and Spanish  Fewer AI detection solutions can detect AI generated text in languages like Farsi  Arabic  or Hindi      citation needed     

Image  video  and audio detection edit 
Several purported AI image detection software exist  to detect AI generated images  for example  those originating from Midjourney or DALL E   They are not completely reliable                         
Others claim to identify video and audio deepfakes  but this technology is also not fully reliable yet either             
Despite debate around the efficacy of watermarking  Google DeepMind is actively developing a detection software called SynthID  which works by inserting a digital watermark that is invisible to the human eye into the pixels of an image
