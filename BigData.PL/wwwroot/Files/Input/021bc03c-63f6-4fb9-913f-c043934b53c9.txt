Edward Fredkin  October           June                      was an American computer scientist  physicist and businessman who was an early pioneer of digital physics            
Fredkin s primary contributions included work on reversible computing and cellular automata  While Konrad Zuse s book  Calculating Space         mentioned the importance of reversible computation  the Fredkin gate represented the essential breakthrough             In more recent work  he used the term digital philosophy  DP  
During his career  Fredkin was a professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  a Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at Caltech  a distinguished career professor at Carnegie Mellon University  and a Research Professor of Physics at Boston University 


Early life and education edit 
Fredkin s mother and father were both Russian Jewish immigrants who met in Los Angeles  and he was the youngest child of four             His mother was a concert pianist  although she did not perform professionally  She died from cancer when he was     His father was a businessman but had lost everything in the      stock market crash and as a result  the family was relatively poor  At times he lived with other families or with his older sister  Eventually  his father remarried  and he and his sister moved back in  As a child  he was both entrepreneurial and interested in science and how things work  He did various weekend and after school things to earn money  eventually handling a large newspaper delivery route  At age    he bought chemistry supplies and made his own fireworks  which were then illegal in Los Angeles  He did poorly in school because he didn t do homework  He graduated from John Marshall High School a semester early so that he could earn money for Caltech tuition and living expenses  Caltech later told him he had been admitted with the worst high school grades they had ever seen  He quit Caltech partway through his sophomore year            
In       he joined the United States Air Force  USAF  to become a fighter pilot avoid being drafted into the Korean War             His computer career started in      when the Air Force assigned him to MIT Lincoln Laboratory where he worked on the SAGE computer            

Career edit 
Fredkin worked with a number of companies in the computer field and held academic positions at a number of universities  He was a computer programmer  a pilot  an advisor to businesses and governments  and a physicist  His main interests concerned digital computer like models of basic processes in physics            
Fredkin s initial focus was physics  however  he became involved with computers in      when he was sent by the Air Force  where he had trained as a jet pilot  to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory             On completing his service in       Fredkin was hired by J  C  R  Licklider to work at the research firm  Bolt Beranek  amp  Newman  BBN    After seeing the PDP   computer prototype at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference in Boston  in December       Fredkin recommended that BBN purchase the very first PDP   to support research projects at BBN  The new hardware was initially delivered with no software whatsoever 
Fredkin wrote a PDP   assembler language called FRAP  Free of Rules Assembly Program  also sometimes called Fredkin s Assembly Program   and its first operating system  OS    He organized and founded the Digital Equipment Computer Users  Society  DECUS  in       and participated in its early projects   Working directly with Ben Gurley  the designer of the PDP    Fredkin designed significant modifications to the hardware to support time sharing via the BBN Time Sharing System  He invented and designed the first modern interrupt system  which Digital called the  Sequence Break       citation needed      He went on to become a contributor in the field of Artificial Intelligence  AI              
In       he founded Information International  Inc   an early computer technology company which developed high precision film to digital scanners  as well as other leading edge hardware  The company became publicly traded and Fredkin became a millionaire            
In       Marvin Minsky  who he had met at BBN             recruited Fredkin to work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT  as a full professor despite the fact that he had never graduated from college             From      to       Fredkin was the Director of Project MAC at MIT               Project MAC was renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science in                    He spent a year at Caltech as a Fairchild Distinguished Scholar  teaching Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman about computing and learning quantum mechanics from him             Then he was a Professor of Physics at Boston University for six years             
Fredkin had formal and informal associations with Carnegie Mellon University  CMU  over several decades  His later     when       academic interests were in the area of digital mechanics  which is the study of discrete models of fundamental process in physics              Fredkin has been a Distinguished Career Professor of Computer Science at CMU             and also a visiting scientist at MIT Media Laboratory              As of          update       he was Distinguished Career Professor of Robotics at CMU             
Fredkin served as the founder or CEO of a diverse set of companies  including Information International  Three Rivers Computer Corporation  New England Television Corporation  owner of Boston s then CBS affiliate WNEV on channel     and The Reliable Water Company  manufacturer of advanced sea water desalination plants              
Fredkin was broadly interested in computation  including hardware and software  He was the inventor of the trie data structure  radio transponders for vehicle identification  the concept of computer navigation for automobiles  the Fredkin gate  and the Billiard Ball Computer Model for reversible computing              He has also been involved in computer vision  chess  and other areas of Artificial Intelligence research            
Fredkin also worked at the intersection of theoretical issues in the physics of computation with computational models of physics  He invented the SALT Cellular Automata family      citation needed      Dan Miller designed and programmed the Busy Boxes implementation of Salt  with assistance from Suresh Kumar Devanathan   The early SALT models are     dimensional quasi physical  reversible  universal cellular automata  that are second order in time  and that follow rules that model CPT reversibility                         

Fredkin s version of digital philosophy edit 
Digital Philosophy  DP  is one type of digital physics pancomputationalism  a school of philosophy which claims that all the physical processes of nature are forms of computation or information processing at the most fundamental level of reality  Pancomputationalism is related to several larger schools of philosophy  atomism  determinism  mechanism  monism  naturalism  philosophical realism  reductionism  and scientific empiricism 
Pancomputationalists believe that biology reduces to chemistry which reduces to physics which reduces to the computation of information  Fredkin s career and achievements had much of their motivation in digital philosophy  a particular type of  pancomputationalism  described in Fredkin s papers  including  Introduction to Digital Philosophy    On the Soul    Finite Nature    A New Cosmogony   and  Digital Mechanics              
Fredkin s digital philosophy contains several fundamental ideas      citation needed     

Everything in physics and physical reality must have a digital informational representation 
All changes in physical nature are consequences of digital informational processes 
Nature is finite and digital 
The traditional Judaeo Christian concept of the soul has a counterpart in a static dynamic soul defined in terms of digital philosophy 
Later projects edit 
PDP   Restoration Project edit 
Fredkin chaired the PDP   Restoration Project  which was able to restore and reactivate the Computer History Museum s PDP   computer after seven months of work                         

Death edit 
Fredkin died in Brookline  Massachusetts  on June           at the age of                

Awards and honors edit 
In       Fredkin was awarded the Carnegie Mellon University Dickson Prize in Science  given annually to the person who has been judged to have made the most progress in a scientific field in the United States during that year              In       CMU established the Fredkin professorship             

Cultural references edit 
A profile of Fredkin  along with a readable explanation of some of his theories  can be found in the first part of Three Scientists and Their Gods by Robert Wright         The section of the book covering Fredkin was excerpted in The Atlantic Monthly in April                  
According to biographer Robert Wright  the character Stephen Falken in the film WarGames was modeled after Fredkin
