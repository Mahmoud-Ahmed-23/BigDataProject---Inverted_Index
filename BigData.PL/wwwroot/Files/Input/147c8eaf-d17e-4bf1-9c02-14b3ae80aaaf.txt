At its core it introduces the ndarray  n dimensional array  object which allows us to store and manipulate large datasets in a memory efficient manner  Unlike Python       s built in lists  NumPy arrays are homogeneous and enable faster operations 
Important Facts to Know  
Vectorized Operations  NumPy operations are faster than Python lists because they use optimized C based functions Broadcasting Feature  NumPy allows operations between arrays of different shapes without explicit looping known as broadcasting making it  easier to handle large datasets What is NumPy Used for With NumPy  you can perform a wide range of numerical operations  including 
Creating and manipulating arrays Performing element wise and matrix operations Generating random numbers and statistical calculations Conducting linear algebra operations Working with Fourier transformations Handling missing values efficiently in datasets Why Learn NumPy NumPy speeds up math operations like addition and multiplication on large groups of numbers compared to regular Python  It s good for handling large lists of numbers  arrays   so you don t have to write complicated loops It gives ready to use functions for statistics  algebra and random numbers Libraries like Pandas  SciPy  TensorFlow and many others are built on top of NumPy NumPy uses less memory and stores data more efficiently  which matters when working with lots of data NumPy BasicsThis section covers the fundamentals of NumPy  including installation  importing the library and understanding its core functionalities  You will learn about the advantages of NumPy over Python lists and how to set up your environment for efficient numerical computing
