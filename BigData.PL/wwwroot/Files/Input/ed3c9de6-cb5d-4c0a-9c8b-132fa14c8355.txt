In economics  utility is a measure of a certain person s satisfaction from a certain state of the world  Over time  the term has been used with at least two meanings 

In a normative context  utility refers to a goal or objective that we wish to maximize  i e   an objective function  This kind of utility bears a closer resemblance to the original utilitarian concept  developed by moral philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill 
In a descriptive context  the term refers to an apparent objective function  such a function is revealed by a person s behavior  and specifically by their preferences over lotteries 
The relationship between these two kinds of utility functions has been a source of controversy among both economists and ethicists  with most maintaining that the two are distinct but generally related 


Utility function edit 
Consider a set of alternatives among which a person has a preference ordering  A utility function represents that ordering if it is possible to assign a real number to each alternative in such a manner that alternative a is assigned a number greater than alternative b if and only if the individual prefers alternative a to alternative b  In this situation  someone who selects the most preferred alternative must also choose one that maximizes the associated utility function  
Suppose James has utility function 
  
    
      
        U
         
        
          
            x
            y
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle U   sqrt  xy   
  
 such that 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
      displaystyle x 
  
 is the number of apples and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
      displaystyle y 
  
 is the number of chocolates  Alternative A has 
  
    
      
        x
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle x   
  
 apples and 
  
    
      
        y
         
          
      
    
      displaystyle y    
  
 chocolates  alternative B has 
  
    
      
        x
         
          
      
    
      displaystyle x    
  
 apples and 
  
    
      
        y
         
          
      
    
      displaystyle y    
  
 chocolates  Putting the values 
  
    
      
        x
         
        y
      
    
      displaystyle x y 
  
 into the utility function yields 
  
    
      
        
          
             
              xd  
              
          
        
         
          
      
    
      displaystyle   sqrt    times         
  
 for alternative A and 
  
    
      
        
          
              
              xd  
              
          
        
         
          
      
    
      displaystyle   sqrt     times         
  
 for B  so James prefers alternative B  In general economic terms  a utility function ranks preferences concerning a set of goods and services 
G rard Debreu derived the conditions required for a preference ordering to be representable by a utility function             For a finite set of alternatives  these require only that the preference ordering is complete  so the individual can determine which of any two alternatives is preferred or that they are indifferent   and that the preference order is transitive 
Suppose the set of alternatives is not finite  for example  even if the number of goods is finite  the quantity chosen can be any real number on an interval   In that case  a continuous utility function exists representing a consumer s preferences if and only if the consumer s preferences are complete  transitive  and continuous            

Applications edit 
Utility can be represented through sets of indifference curve  which are level curves of the function itself and which plot the combination of commodities that an individual would accept to maintain a given level of satisfaction  Combining indifference curves with budget constraints allows for individual demand curves derivation 
A diagram of a general indifference curve is shown below  Figure     The vertical and horizontal axes represent an individual s consumption of commodity Y and X respectively  All the combinations of commodity X and Y along the same indifference curve are regarded indifferently by individuals  which means all the combinations along an indifference curve result in the same utility value   

Figure  
Individual and social utility can be construed as the value of a utility function and a social welfare function  respectively   When coupled with production or commodity constraints  by some assumptions  these functions can be used to analyze Pareto efficiency  such as illustrated by Edgeworth boxes in contract curves  Such efficiency is a major concept in welfare economics 

Preference edit 
While preferences are the conventional foundation of choice theory in microeconomics  it is often convenient to represent preferences with a utility function   Let X be the consumption set  the set of all mutually exclusive baskets the consumer could consume   The consumer s utility function 
  
    
      
        u
          x a 
        X
          x     
        
          R
        
      
    
      displaystyle u colon X to  mathbb  R   
  
 ranks each possible outcome in the consumption set   If the consumer strictly prefers x to y or is indifferent between them  then 
  
    
      
        u
         
        x
         
          x     
        u
         
        y
         
      
    
      displaystyle u x  geq u y  
  
 
For example  suppose a consumer s consumption set is X         nothing         apple        orange         apple and        orange         apples         oranges   and his utility function is u nothing                 u        apple                 u        orange                 u        apple and        orange                 u        apples                and u        oranges                  Then this consumer prefers   orange to   apple but prefers one of each to   oranges 
In micro economic models  there is usually a finite set of L commodities  and a consumer may consume an arbitrary amount of each commodity   This gives a consumption set of 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
             
          
          
            L
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle  mathbb  R        L  
  
  and each package 
  
    
      
        x
          x     
        
          
            R
          
          
             
          
          
            L
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle x in  mathbb  R        L  
  
 is a vector containing the amounts of each commodity   For the example  there are two commodities  apples and oranges   If we say apples are the first commodity  and oranges the second  then the consumption set is 
  
    
      
        X
         
        
          
            R
          
          
             
          
          
             
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle X  mathbb  R           
  
 and u                           u                           u                           u                           u                           u                          as before   For u to be a utility function on      X  however  it must be defined for every package in      X  so now the function must be defined for fractional apples and oranges too  One function that would fit these numbers is 
  
    
      
        u
         
        
          x

Preferences have three main properties 

Completeness
Assume an individual has two choices  A and B  By ranking the two choices  one and only one of the following relationships is true  an individual strictly prefers A  A       gt       B   an individual strictly prefers B  B gt A   an individual is indifferent between A and B  A             B  
Either a   b OR b   a  OR both  for all  a b 

Transitivity
Individuals  preferences are consistent over bundles  If an individual prefers bundle A to bundle B and bundle B to bundle C  then it can be assumed that the individual prefers bundle A to bundle C 
 If a   b and b   c  then a   c for all  a b c   

Non satiation or monotonicity
If bundle A contains all the goods that a bundle B contains  but A also includes more of at least one good than B  The individual prefers A over B             If  for example  bundle A                     apple        oranges   and bundle B                     apple        orange   then A is preferred over B 

Revealed preference edit 
It was recognized that utility could not be measured or observed directly  so instead economists devised a way to infer relative utilities from observed choice  These  revealed preferences   as termed by Paul Samuelson  were revealed e g  in people s willingness to pay  


Utility is assumed to be correlative to Desire or Want  It has been argued already that desires cannot be measured directly  but only indirectly  by the outward phenomena which they cause  and that in those cases with which economics is mainly concerned the measure is found by the price which a person is willing to pay for the fulfillment or satisfaction of his desire                                 
Functions edit 
Utility functions  expressing utility as a function of the amounts of the various goods consumed  are treated as either cardinal or ordinal  depending on whether they are or are not interpreted as providing more information than simply the rank ordering of preferences among bundles of goods  such as information concerning the strength of preferences 

Cardinal edit 
Main article  Cardinal utility
Cardinal utility states that the utilities obtained from consumption can be measured and ranked objectively and are representable by numbers             There are fundamental assumptions of cardinal utility  Economic agents should be able to rank different bundles of goods based on their preferences or utilities and sort different transitions between two bundles of goods            
A cardinal utility function can be transformed to another utility function by a positive linear transformation  multiplying by a positive number  and adding some other number   however  both utility functions represent the same preferences            
When cardinal utility is assumed  the magnitude of utility differences is treated as an ethically or behaviorally significant quantity  For example  suppose a cup of orange juice has utility of      utils   a cup of tea has a utility of    utils  and a cup of water has a utility of    utils  With cardinal utility  it can be concluded that the cup of orange juice is better than the cup of tea by the same amount by which the cup of tea is better than the cup of water  This means that if a person has a cup of tea  they would be willing to take any bet with a probability  p  greater than    of getting a cup of juice  with a risk of getting a cup of water equal to   p  One cannot conclude  however  that the cup of tea is two thirds of the goodness of the cup of juice because this conclusion would depend not only on magnitudes of utility differences but also on the  zero  of utility  For example  if the  zero  of utility were located at      then a cup of orange juice would be     utils more than zero  a cup of tea     utils more than zero  Cardinal utility can be considered as the assumption that quantifiable characteristics  such as height  weight  temperature  etc can measure utility 
Neoclassical economics has largely retreated from using cardinal utility functions as the basis of economic behavior  A notable exception is in the context of analyzing choice with conditions of risk  see below  
Sometimes cardinal utility is used to aggregate utilities across persons  to create a social welfare function 

Ordinal edit 
Main article  Ordinal utility
Instead of giving actual numbers over different bundles  ordinal utilities are only the rankings of utilities received from different bundles of goods or services             For example  ordinal utility could tell that having two ice creams provide a greater utility to individuals in comparison to one ice cream but could not tell exactly how much extra utility received by the individual  Ordinal utility  it does not require individuals to specify how much extra utility they received from the preferred bundle of goods or services in comparison to other bundles  They are only needed to tell which bundles they prefer  
When ordinal utilities are used  differences in utils  values assumed by the utility function  are treated as ethically or behaviorally meaningless   the utility index encodes a full behavioral ordering between members of a choice set  but tells nothing about the related strength of preferences  For the above example  it would only be possible to say that juice is preferred to tea to water  Thus  ordinal utility utilizes comparisons  such as  preferred to    no more    less than   etc 
If a function 
  
    
      
        u
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle u x  
  
 is ordinal and non negative  it is equivalent to the function 
  
    
      
        u
         
        x
        
           
          
             
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle u x      
  
  because taking the square is an increasing monotone  or monotonic  transformation  This means that the ordinal preference induced by these functions is the same  although they are two different functions   In contrast  if 
  
    
      
        u
         
        x
         
      
    
      displaystyle u x  
  
 is cardinal  it is not equivalent to 
  
    
      
        u
         
        x
        
           
          
             
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle u x      
  
 

Examples edit 
In order to simplify calculations  various alternative assumptions have been made concerning details of human preferences  and these imply various alternative utility functions such as 

CES  constant elasticity of substitution  
Isoelastic utility
Exponential utility
Quasilinear utility
Homothetic preferences
Stone Geary utility function
Gorman polar form
Greenwood Hercowitz Huffman preferences
King Plosser Rebelo preferences
Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion
Most utility functions used for modeling or theory are well behaved  They are usually monotonic and quasi concave  However  it is possible for rational preferences not to be representable by a utility function  An example is lexicographic preferences which are not continuous and cannot be represented by a continuous utility function            

Marginal utility edit 
Economists distinguish between total utility and marginal utility  Total utility is the utility of an alternative  an entire consumption bundle or situation in life  The rate of change of utility from changing the quantity of one good consumed is termed the marginal utility of that good  Marginal utility therefore measures the slope of the utility function with respect to the changes of one good             Marginal utility usually decreases with consumption of the good  the idea of  diminishing marginal utility   In calculus notation  the marginal utility of good X is 
  
    
      
        M
        
          U
          
            x
          
        
         
        
          
            
                x     
              U
            
            
                x     
              X
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle MU  x    frac   partial U   partial X   
  
  When a good s marginal utility is positive  additional consumption of it increases utility  if zero  the consumer is satiated and indifferent about consuming more  if negative  the consumer would pay to reduce his consumption              

Law of diminishing marginal utility edit 
Rational individuals only consume additional units of goods if it increases the marginal utility  However  the law of diminishing marginal utility means an additional unit consumed brings a lower marginal utility than that carried by the previous unit consumed  For example  drinking one bottle of water makes a thirsty person satisfied  as the consumption of water increases  he may feel begin to feel bad which causes the marginal utility to decrease to zero or even become negative  Furthermore  this is also used to analyze progressive taxes as the greater taxes can result in the loss of utility 

Marginal rate of substitution  MRS  edit 
Marginal rate of substitution is the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve  which measures how much an individual is willing to switch from one good to another  Using a mathematic equation  
  
    
      
        M
        R
        S
         
          x     
        d
        
        
          x
          
             
          
        
        
           
        
        d
        
        
          x
          
             
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle MRS   operatorname  d    x      operatorname  d    x     
  
keeping U x  x   constant  Thus  MRS is how much an individual is willing to pay for consuming a greater amount of x   
MRS is related to marginal utility  The relationship between marginal utility and MRS is

Expected utility edit 
Main article  Expected utility hypothesis
Expected utility theory deals with the analysis of choices among risky projects with multiple  possibly multidimensional  outcomes 
The St  Petersburg paradox was first proposed by Nicholas Bernoulli in      and solved by Daniel Bernoulli in       although the Swiss mathematician Gabriel Cramer proposed taking the expectation of a square root utility function of money in an      letter to N  Bernoulli  D  Bernoulli argued that the paradox could be resolved if decision makers displayed risk aversion and argued for a logarithmic cardinal utility function   Analysis of international survey data during the   st century has shown that insofar as utility represents happiness  as for utilitarianism  it is indeed proportional to log of income  
The first important use of the expected utility theory was that of John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern  who used the assumption of expected utility maximization in their formulation of game theory 
In finding the probability weighted average of the utility from each possible outcome

Von Neumann and Morgenstern addressed situations in which the outcomes of choices are not known with certainty  but have probabilities associated with them 
A notation for a lottery is as follows  if options A and B have probability p and               p in the lottery  we write it as a linear combination 


  
    
      
        L
         
        p
        A

By making some reasonable assumptions about the way choices behave  von Neumann and Morgenstern showed that if an agent can choose between the lotteries  then this agent has a utility function such that the desirability of an arbitrary lottery can be computed as a linear combination of the utilities of its parts  with the weights being their probabilities of occurring 
This is termed the expected utility theorem  The required assumptions are four axioms about the properties of the agent s preference relation over  simple lotteries   which are lotteries with just two options  Writing

 to mean  A is weakly preferred to B    A is preferred at least as much as B    the axioms are

Of all the axioms  independence is the most often discarded  A variety of generalized expected utility theories have arisen  most of which omit or relax the independence axiom 

Indirect utility edit 
Main article  Indirect utility
An indirect utility function gives the optimal attainable value of a given utility function  which depends on the prices of the goods and the income or wealth level that the individual possesses 

Money edit 
One use of the indirect utility concept is the notion of the utility of money   The  indirect  utility function for money is a nonlinear function that is bounded and asymmetric about the origin  The utility function is concave in the positive region  representing the phenomenon of diminishing marginal utility   The boundedness represents the fact that beyond a certain amount money ceases being useful at all  as the size of any economy at that time is itself bounded   The asymmetry about the origin represents the fact that gaining and losing money can have radically different implications both for individuals and businesses   The non linearity of the utility function for money has profound implications in decision making processes  in situations where outcomes of choices influence utility by gains or losses of money  which are the norm for most business settings  the optimal choice for a given decision depends on the possible outcomes of all other decisions in the same time period             

Budget constraints edit 
Individuals  consumptions are constrained by their budget allowance  The graph of budget line is a linear  downward sloping line between X and Y axes  All the bundles of consumption under the budget line allow individuals to consume without using the whole budget as the total budget is greater than the total cost of bundles  Figure     If only considers prices and quantities of two goods in one bundle  a budget constraint could be formulated as 
  
    
      
        
          p

Constrained utility optimisation edit 
Rational consumers wish to maximise their utility  However  as they have budget constraints  a change of price would affect the quantity of demand  There are two factors could explain this situation 

Purchasing power  Individuals obtain greater purchasing power when the price of a good decreases  The reduction of the price allows individuals to increase their savings so they could afford to buy other products 
Substitution effect  If the price of good A decreases  then the good becomes relatively cheaper with respect to its substitutes  Thus  individuals would consume more of good A as the utility would increase by doing so 
Discussion and criticism edit 
Cambridge economist Joan Robinson famously criticized utility for being a circular concept   Utility is the quality in commodities that makes individuals want to buy them  and the fact that individuals want to buy commodities shows that they have utility                                    Robinson also stated that because the theory assumes that preferences are fixed this means that utility is not a testable assumption  This is so because if we observe changes of peoples  behavior in relation to a change in prices or a change in budget constraint we can never be sure to what extent the change in behavior was due to the change of price or budget constraint and how much was due to a change of preference                  unreliable source      This criticism is similar to that of the philosopher Hans Albert who argued that the ceteris paribus  all else equal  conditions on which the marginalist theory of demand rested rendered the theory itself a meaningless tautology  incapable of being tested experimentally                  unreliable source      In essence  a curve of demand and supply  a theoretical line of quantity of a product which would have been offered or requested for given price  is purely ontological and could never have been demonstrated empirically     dubious             discuss      
Other questions of what arguments ought to be included in a utility function are difficult to answer  yet seem necessary to understanding utility  Whether people gain utility from coherence of wants  beliefs or a sense of duty is important to understanding their behavior in the utility organon              Likewise  choosing between alternatives is itself a process of determining what to consider as alternatives  a question of choice within uncertainty             
An evolutionary psychology theory is that utility may be better considered as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary fitness in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one

There are many empirical works trying to estimate the form of utility functions of agents with respect to money
