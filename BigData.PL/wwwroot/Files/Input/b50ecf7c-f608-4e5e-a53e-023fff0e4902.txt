Thesaurus Linguae Latinae 
A modern english thesaurus 
A thesaurus  pl   thesauri or thesauruses   sometimes called a synonym dictionary or dictionary of synonyms  is a reference work which arranges words by their meanings  or in simpler terms  a book where one can find different words with similar meanings to other words                         sometimes as a hierarchy of broader and narrower terms  sometimes simply as lists of synonyms and antonyms  They are often used by writers to help find the best word to express an idea 

   to find the word  or words  by which  an  idea may be most fitly and aptly expressed        Peter Mark Roget                 
Synonym dictionaries have a long history  The word  thesaurus  was used in      by Peter Mark Roget for his Roget s Thesaurus 
While some works called  thesauri   such as Roget s Thesaurus  group words in a hierarchical hypernymic taxonomy of concepts  others are organised alphabetically                       or in some other way 
Most thesauri do not include definitions  but many dictionaries include listings of synonyms 
Some thesauri and dictionary synonym notes characterise the distinctions between similar words  with notes on their  connotations and varying shades of meaning              Some synonym dictionaries are primarily concerned with differentiating synonyms by meaning and usage  Usage manuals such as Fowler s Dictionary of Modern English Usage or Garner s Modern English Usage often prescribe appropriate usage of synonyms 
Writers sometimes use thesauri to avoid repetition of words   elegant variation   which is often criticised by usage manuals   Writers sometimes use them not just to vary their vocabularies but to dress them up too much             


Etymology edit 
The word  thesaurus  comes from Latin th saurus  which in turn comes from Greek           th sauros   treasure  treasury  storehouse              The word th sauros is of uncertain etymology                                  
Until the   th century  a thesaurus was any dictionary or encyclopedia             as in the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae  Dictionary of the Latin Language         and the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae  Dictionary of the Greek Language         It was Roget who introduced the meaning  collection of words arranged according to sense   in                 

History edit 
Peter Mark Roget  author of Roget s thesaurus
In antiquity  Philo of Byblos authored the first text that could now be called a thesaurus  In Sanskrit  the Amarakosha is a thesaurus in verse form  written in the  th century 
The study of synonyms became an important theme in   th century philosophy  and Condillac wrote  but never published  a dictionary of synonyms                         
Some early synonym dictionaries include 

John Wilkins  An Essay Towards a Real Character  and a Philosophical Language and Alphabetical Dictionary        is a  regular enumeration and description of all those things and notions to which names are to be assigned   They are not explicitly synonym dictionaries   in fact  they do not even use the word  synonym    but they do group synonyms together                                     
Gabriel Girard  La Justesse de la langue fran oise  ou les diff rentes significations des mots qui passent pour synonymes

Roget s Thesaurus  first compiled in      by Peter Mark Roget  and published in       follows John Wilkins  semantic arrangement of       Unlike earlier synonym dictionaries  it does not include definitions or aim to help the user choose among synonyms  It has been continuously in print since      and remains widely used across the English speaking world              Roget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition             

It is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded  Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my deficiencies  I had  in the year       completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale  but on the same principle  and nearly in the same form  as the Thesaurus now published 

Organization edit 
Conceptual edit 
Roget s original thesaurus was organized into      conceptual Heads  e g       Debt  organized into a four level taxonomy  For example  debt is classed under V ii iv             

Class five  Volition  the exercise of the will
Division Two  Social volition
Section    Possessive Relations
Subsection    Monetary relations 
Each head includes direct synonyms  Debt  obligation  liability       related concepts  interest  usance  usury  related persons  debtor  debitor      defaulter        verbs  to be in debt  to owe      see Borrow        phrases  to run up a bill or score       and adjectives  in debt  indebted  owing       Numbers in parentheses are cross references to other Heads 
The book starts with a Tabular Synopsis of Categories laying out the hierarchy              then the main body of the thesaurus listed by the Head  and then an alphabetical index listing the different Heads under which a word may be found  Liable  subject to       debt       duty                  
Some recent versions have kept the same organization  though often with more detail under each Head              Others have made modest changes such as eliminating the four level taxonomy and adding new heads  one has      Heads in fifteen Classes             
Some non English thesauri have also adopted this model             
In addition to its taxonomic organization  the Historical Thesaurus of English        includes the date when each word came to have a given meaning  It has the novel and unique goal of  charting the semantic development of the huge and varied vocabulary of English  
Different senses of a word are listed separately  For example  three different senses of  debt  are listed in three different places in the taxonomy             
A sum of money that is owed or due  a liability or obligation to pay

Society
Trade and Finance
Management of Money
Insolvency
Indebtedness  noun 
An immaterial debt  is an obligation to do something

Society
Morality
Duty or obligation
 noun 
An offence requiring expiation  figurative  Biblical 

Society
Faith
Aspects of faith
Spirituality
Sin
 noun 
instance of
Alphabetical edit 
Other thesauri and synonym dictionaries are organized alphabetically 
Most repeat the list of synonyms under each word                                                 
Some designate a principal entry for each concept and cross reference it                                     
A third system interfiles words and conceptual headings  Francis March s Thesaurus Dictionary gives for liability  CONTINGENCY  CREDIT DEBT  DUTY DERELICTION  LIBERTY SUBJECTION  MONEY  each of which is a conceptual heading              The CREDIT DEBT article has multiple subheadings  including Nouns of Agent  Verbs  Verbal Expressions  etc  Under each are listed synonyms with brief definitions  e g   Credit  Transference of property on promise of future payment   The conceptual headings are not organized into a taxonomy 
Benjamin Lafaye s Synonymes fran ais        is organized around morphologically related families of synonyms  e g  logis  logement               and his Dictionnaire des synonymes de la langue fran aise        is mostly alphabetical  but also includes a section on morphologically related synonyms  which is organized by prefix  suffix  or construction             

Contrasting senses edit 
Before Roget  most thesauri and dictionary synonym notes included discussions of the differences among near synonyms  as do some modern ones                                                
Merriam Webster s Dictionary of Synonyms is a stand alone modern English synonym dictionary that does discuss differences              In addition  many general English dictionaries include synonym notes 
Several modern synonym dictionaries in French are primarily devoted to discussing the precise demarcations among synonyms                         

Additional elements edit 
Some include short definitions             
Some give illustrative phrases             
Some include lists of objects within the category  hyponyms   e g  breeds of dogs             

Bilingual edit 
Bilingual synonym dictionaries are designed for language learners  One such dictionary gives various French words listed alphabetically  with an English translation and an example of use              Another one is organized taxonomically with examples  translations  and some usage notes             

Information science and natural language processing edit 
Main article  Thesaurus  information retrieval 
In library and information science  a thesaurus is a kind of controlled vocabulary 
A thesaurus can form part of an ontology and be represented in the Simple Knowledge Organization System  SKOS              
Thesauri are used in natural language processing for word sense disambiguation             and text simplification for machine translation systems
