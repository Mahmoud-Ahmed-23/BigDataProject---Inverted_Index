Applying machine learning  ML   including deep learning  methods to the study of quantum systems is an emergent area of physics research  A basic example of this is quantum state tomography  where a quantum state is learned from measurement             Other examples include learning Hamiltonians                        learning quantum phase transitions                        and automatically generating new quantum experiments                                              ML is effective at processing large amounts of experimental or calculated data in order to characterize an unknown quantum system  making its application useful in contexts including quantum information theory  quantum technology development  and computational materials design  In this context  for example  it can be used as a tool to interpolate pre calculated interatomic potentials              or directly solving the Schr dinger equation with a variational method             


Applications of machine learning to physics edit 
Noisy data edit 
The ability to experimentally control and prepare increasingly complex quantum systems brings with it a growing need to turn large and noisy data sets into meaningful information  This is a problem that has already been studied extensively in the classical setting  and consequently  many existing machine learning techniques can be naturally adapted to more efficiently address experimentally relevant problems  For example  Bayesian methods and concepts of algorithmic learning can be fruitfully applied to tackle quantum state classification              Hamiltonian learning              and the characterization of an unknown unitary transformation                          Other problems that have been addressed with this approach are given in the following list 

Identifying an accurate model for the dynamics of a quantum system  through the reconstruction of the Hamiltonian                                     
Extracting information on unknown states                                                                        
Learning unknown unitary transformations and measurements                         
Engineering of quantum gates from qubit networks with pairwise interactions  using time dependent             or independent             Hamiltonians 
Improving the extraction accuracy of physical observables from absorption images of ultracold atoms  degenerate Fermi gas   by the generation of an ideal reference frame             
Calculated and noise free data edit 
Quantum machine learning can also be applied to dramatically accelerate the prediction of quantum properties of molecules and materials              This can be helpful for the computational design of new molecules or materials  Some examples include

Interpolating interatomic potentials             
Inferring molecular atomization energies throughout chemical compound space             
Accurate potential energy surfaces with restricted Boltzmann machines             
Automatic generation of new quantum experiments                       
Solving the many body  static and time dependent Schr dinger equation             
Identifying phase transitions from entanglement spectra             
Generating adaptive feedback schemes for quantum metrology and quantum tomography                         
Variational circuits edit 
Variational circuits are a family of algorithms which utilize training based on circuit parameters and an objective function              Variational circuits are generally composed of a classical device communicating input parameters  random or pre trained parameters  into a quantum device  along with a classical Mathematical optimization function  These circuits are very heavily dependent on the architecture of the proposed quantum device because parameter adjustments are adjusted based solely on the classical components within the device              Though the application is considerably infantile in the field of quantum machine learning  it has incredibly high promise for more efficiently generating efficient optimization functions 

Sign problem edit 
Machine learning techniques can be used to find a better manifold of integration for path integrals in order to avoid the sign problem             

Fluid dynamics edit 
This section is an excerpt from Deep learning   Partial differential equations  edit 
Physics informed neural networks have been used to solve partial differential equations in both forward and inverse problems in a data driven manner              One example is the reconstructing fluid flow governed by the Navier Stokes equations  Using physics informed neural networks does not require the often expensive mesh generation that conventional CFD methods rely on

Illustration of how an AI learns the basic fundamental physical concept of  unchangeableness             
A deep learning system was reported to learn intuitive physics from visual data  of virtual  D environments  based on an unpublished approach inspired by studies of visual cognition in infants                          Other researchers have developed a machine learning algorithm that could discover sets of basic variables of various physical systems and predict the systems  future dynamics from video recordings of their behavior                          In the future  it may be possible that such can be used to automate the discovery of physical laws of complex systems              Beyond discovery and prediction   blank slate  type of learning of fundamental aspects of the physical world may have further applications such as improving adaptive and broad artificial general intelligence      additional citation s  needed      In specific  prior machine learning models were  highly specialised and lack a general understanding of the world
