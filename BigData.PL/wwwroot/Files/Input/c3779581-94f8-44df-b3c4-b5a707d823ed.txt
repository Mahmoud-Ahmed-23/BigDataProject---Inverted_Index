History edit 
In the   th century  IBM and Microsoft dominated the IT industry             After the dot com bubble wiped out most of the Nasdaq Composite stock market index  surviving tech startups expanded their market share and became dominant in their markets  The term Big Tech began to appear around       when some economists speculated that a lack of regulation could lead to concentrated market power  The term Big Tech became popular following the investigation into Russian interference in the      United States elections  because access to a large amount of data allowed tech companies to influence their users             The concept of Big Tech is similar to how the largest oil companies were called Big Oil following the     s energy crisis  and the largest cigarette producers were called Big Tobacco  as Congress sought to regulate those industries             It is also similar to how  at the turn of the   st century  the mainstream media became dominated by a small number of corporations called Big Media or the Media Giants             In the early     s  software developers and cryptocurrency users responded to the perceived excesses of the tech giants by starting a movement called web                                     to incorporate blockchain based decentralization into the World Wide Web

Alphabet  Amazon  Apple  Meta  and Microsoft are known as the Big Five tech companies                                                              They are among the most valuable public companies                          In       the Big Five ranked as the second through sixth most valuable public companies in the world  behind Saudi Aramco              In August       the Big Five accounted for nearly a quarter of the S amp P      In March       Apple and Microsoft accounted for    percent of the S amp P                  The Big Five are among the most prestigious employers in the world                                     
In the   st century the Big Five tech companies surpassed the market capitalization of the historically dominant Big Oil companies BP  Chevron  ExxonMobil  and Shell  In       Jason Whittaker stated that they also outpaced Big Media companies such as Comcast  Disney  and Warner Bros  Discovery by a factor of                 In       the Big Five had a combined value of over           trillion  and made up almost half of the Nasdaq                 

Magnificent Seven edit 
A broader group known as the Magnificent Seven adds Nvidia and Tesla to the Big Five  based on their substantial contributions to the S amp P     index since       In       the group was responsible for nearly two thirds of the S amp P     s     gain              The Magnificent Seven delivered a      return on investment that year  a performance analysts attributed to the artificial intelligence boom and expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve             
By January       the group accounted for     of the S amp P    s total market capitalization              In February  as the Magnificent Seven neared a combined valuation of     trillion              Deutsche Bank observed that the group s combined market capitalization exceeded that of every public company in every G   country except China  Japan  and the United States itself             
At the end of the second quarter of       Morgan Stanley estimated that the Magnificent Seven represented     of the S amp P    s total valuation              Some analysts expressed concern that the group s extreme concentration could trigger a downturn similar to the dot com crash or even the Wall Street Crash of                   Others argued the companies could continue to outperform due to sustained inflows into index funds             
On August          the Magnificent Seven collectively lost    trillion in market value at the start of trading hours             
The term Magnificent Seven was coined in May      by Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett  referencing the      Western film              and popularized by Jim Cramer  the host of CNBC s Mad Money             

Acronyms edit 
Acronyms such as FANG  FAANG  GAFA  GAFAM  MAMAA  GAMMA  and others have been used to refer to Big Tech companies              Alphabet  the parent company of Google  may be represented by G in these acronyms  and Meta  the rebranding of Facebook  may be represented by F             

The acronym FANG was coined in      by Jim Cramer  to refer to Facebook  Amazon  Netflix  and Google  Cramer called these companies  totally dominant in their markets                Cramer stated that the four companies were poised to  take a bite out of  the bear market  giving a double meaning to the acronym  according to Cramer s colleague at RealMoney com  Bob Lang                                         Cramer expanded FANG to FAANG in       adding Apple to the list because its revenue made it a potential Fortune    company              
Following Facebook s name change to Meta Platforms in October       as well as the      creation of Google holding company Alphabet  Cramer suggested replacing FAANG with MAMAA  replacing Netflix with Microsoft because Netflix s valuation had fallen behind the other companies  With Microsoft  these companies were each valued at over           billion compared to Netflix s           billion              In November       The Motley Fool suggested MANAMANA  a reference to the      song  Mah N  Mah N    as an acronym that stands for Microsoft  Apple  Netflix  Alphabet  Meta  Amazon  Nvidia  and Adobe              
At the international level Baidu  Alibaba  Tencent and Xiaomi  referred to as BATX  are often seen as Chinese competitors to Big Tech  Futurist Amy Webb has called the combination of the Big Five  IBM  Alibaba  Baidu  and Tencent  G MAFIA BAT               

Causes edit 
Nikos Smyrnaios argued in      that four phenomena allowed Big Tech to emerge  technological convergence  deregulation  globalization  and financialization              He argued that people like Nicholas Negroponte promoted technological convergence and made an Internet oligopoly appear desirable  The complexity of IT made competition law ineffective  resulting in industry self regulation  Globalization allowed Big Tech companies to minimize their tax burden and pay foreign workers lower wages              Without regulation  Big Tech earned big profits  in       Google  Apple  and Facebook earned over    percent profit margins             

Innovation edit 
Critics have alleged that Section     of the Communications Decency Act allowed Big Tech to evade responsibility for user generated content  It states   No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider   Section     has been called  the twenty six words that created the Internet                             Without the legal requirement for content moderation  online services could innovate freely and achieved rapid growth in the early days of the Internet              
According to Alexis Madrigal  the innovation that initially characterized Silicon Valley has been replaced by a strategy of growth through acquisitions               For example  Apple started in      as an engineering focused startup company  and quickly claimed market share from less innovative competitors like Xerox               The tech giants made timely investments in personal computers  websites  e commerce  mobile devices  social media  and cloud computing  and rank highly on the list of companies by research and development spending                            However  large companies tend to focus on operational efficiency instead of new product development              
Legal scholar Tim Wu speculated that Big Tech acquisitions could create  kill zones  that stifle competition by taking potential competitors out of the marketplace  For example  Facebook s acquisition of Instagram prevented Instagram from becoming an independent platform similar to Facebook               On the other hand  Wu stated that Microsoft s concentration of market power created a platform for new kinds of innovation              
According to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation   Virtually all so called killer acquisitions represent the technologies and capabilities the companies view as critical to their competitiveness  If they purchase a company innovating within this zone  they are far more likely to develop its innovation than to bury it  In doing so  they often make the technology available faster and to more people than would otherwise be possible  If companies are prevented from making acquisitions  they are more likely to copy the products or develop alternative innovations than they are to ignore them  Assuming incumbents don t violate intellectual property laws  this type of competition is both legal and socially beneficial               
Competition between cloud platforms including Amazon Web Services  Microsoft Azure  and Google Cloud Platform contributed to open source software infrastructure including LLVM and the Linux kernel  The  cloud wars  also caused Big Tech companies to invest in data centers and undersea cables  The operational efficiency of Big Tech technology stacks means startup companies typically must use Big Tech infrastructure instead of building their own                           

Business strategy edit 
Nikos Smyrnaios argued in      that Big Tech companies concentrate power by vertically integrating data centers  Internet connectivity  computer hardware  including smartphones   operating systems  applications  including Web browsers   and online services  He also argued that they concentrate power by horizontally integrating different services such as email  instant messaging  online searching  downloading  and streaming across platforms              For example  Google and Microsoft pay for their search engines to be included with Apple s iPhone               According to The Economist   Network and scale effects mean that size begets size  while data can act as a barrier to entry               

Capitalism edit 
The      American docudrama film The Social Dilemma argues that capitalism is the root cause of Big Tech s harmful practices              

Criticism edit 
According to The Globe and Mail  both left wing and right wing politicians have criticized Big Tech               Progressives have alleged  runaway profit taking and concentration of wealth   and conservatives have alleged  liberal bias                According to The New York Times   The left generally argues that companies like Facebook and Twitter aren t doing enough to root out misinformation  extremism and hate on their platforms  while the right insists that tech companies are going so overboard in their content decisions that they re suppressing conservative political views                According to The Hill  libertarians oppose government regulation of Big Tech due to their support for laissez faire economics              
Scott Galloway said Big Tech companies  avoid taxes  invade privacy  and destroy jobs                Nikos Smyrnaios described Big Tech as an oligopoly that dominates the information technology market through anti competitive practices  ever increasing economic power  and intellectual property              Smyrnaios argued that the current situation is the result of deregulation  globalization  and the failure of politicians to understand and respond to developments in technology  Smyrnaios recommended developing academic analysis of the political economy of the Internet to understand the methods of domination and to criticize these methods to encourage opposition to that domination

The practice of banning hate speech has received criticism from conservatives               In July       the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust  Commercial and Administrative Law interviewed the CEOs of Alphabet  Amazon  Apple  and Facebook  During the hearings  some members of Congress alleged bias against conservatives on social media               Matt Gaetz protested Amazon s ban on donations to hate groups  stating that Jeff Bezos should  divorce from the SPLC               
On November          President Donald Trump alleged  historic election interference from big money  big media  and big tech   Conservative newspaper The Washington Times criticized Trump s claims as lacking evidence               During Trump s speech that incited the January   United States Capitol attack  he accused Big Tech of rigging the      election and promised to  get rid of  Section      According to Trump   They rigged it like they have never rigged an election before  and by the way  last night  they didn t do a bad job either                After Trump s Twitter account was suspended  German Chancellor Angela Merkel s chief spokesman Steffen Seibert noted that Merkel found Twitter s halt of Trump s account  problematic   adding that legislators  not private companies  should decide on any necessary curbs to free expression if hate speech incites violence                           
According to a February      report by New York University researchers  conservative claims of social media censorship could be considered disinformation because the deleted statements were false  The report also recommended that social media platforms should increase their transparency to push back against claims of censorship                            Conservatives argued that Facebook and Twitter limiting the spread of the Hunter Biden laptop controversy  proves Big Tech s bias                             In some cases  Big Tech platforms reversed actions perceived as censorship  The YouTube channel Right Wing Watch was banned for showing far right content to expose extreme views  but the channel was restored after viewer backlash               Human Rights Watch stated that excessive content removal  especially on Facebook  meant losing evidence of human rights abuses              
Facebook has also been accused of censoring left wing opinions  Facebook removed ads by Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren  who advocated breaking up Facebook               Warren accused the company of having the  ability to shut down a debate  and called for  a social media marketplace that isn t dominated by a single censor                            
In       Meta s Facebook  Elon Musk s X  Google s YouTube  and other tech companies agreed to address online hate speech by enforcing a revised code of conduct aligned with European Commission rules  Henna Virkkunen  the EU tech commissioner  stated that Europe has zero tolerance for hate speech  whether online or offline  She approved the tech companies  commitment to enforcing the code of conduct mandated by the Digital Services Act  DSA

During the COVID    pandemic  Big Tech was criticized for allowing COVID    misinformation                            According to Representatives Frank Pallone  Mike Doyle   and Jan Schakowsky   Industry self regulation has failed  We must begin the work of changing incentives driving social media companies to allow and even promote misinformation and disinformation                             President Joe Biden criticized Facebook for allowing anti vaccine activism                            Imran Ahmed  CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate  said   While they fail to take action  lives are being lost                In response to the criticism  Big Tech companies deleted numerous social media accounts and banned health related false advertising  Human Rights Watch has criticized Big Tech  primarily Facebook  for allowing misinformation to spread in developing countries              

Censorship by governments edit

Environmental impact edit 
This section is an excerpt from Environmental impact of Big Tech  edit 
The environmental impact of Big Tech is a phenomenon in which many aspects of Big Tech contribute to negative impacts on the environment and climate change  In the big data age  technologists and people in general find it valuable to view emerging technologies with a critical lens  one of which is geared toward the environment  As these emerging technologies become more popular  they consider the extent at which they contribute to changes in the environment and whether they are inherently positive or negative 

A      report from Greenpeace and Stand earth highlights the technology sector s rapid growth  driving a significant increase in electricity consumption  projected to rise by over     between      and       This increase in energy usage is coupled with a rise in carbon emissions attributed to the sector s heavy dependence on fossil fuels  While some Big Tech firms have committed to transitioning to      renewable energy for their operations  this commitment has not yet extended to their supply chains  Seven out of ten ranked consumer electronics brands have committed to achieve      renewable energy across their own operations by       with Apple  Google  and Microsoft already achieving this goal               In       Big Tech accounted for approximately   percent of global greenhouse gas emissions  surpassing those of the aviation industry               Google and Microsoft each consumed    TWh of electricity in       more than countries such as Iceland  Ghana  the Dominican Republic  or Tunisia              
Reuse of copyrighted content edit 
On May          the Parliament of France passed a law intended to force Big Tech to pay publishers for the reuse of substantial amounts of copyrighted content  related rights   The law is aimed at implementing Article    of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market of the European Union              

Antitrust efforts edit 
Concerns over monopolistic practices have led to antitrust investigations in Big Tech from both United States and European Union regulatory agencies                                                      These investigations have raised concerns around Big Tech on privacy  market power  freedom of speech  national security  and law enforcement               In       John Naughton wrote in The Guardian   It s almost impossible to function without the big five tech giants               

United States edit

Under United States antitrust law  the consumer welfare standard assumes that large companies are not automatically harmful  Antitrust enforcement generally aims to prevent harm to consumers               According to some policy analysts  Big Tech innovation benefits consumers               Big Tech CEOs have consistently opposed antitrust regulation  Antitrust investigations of Big Tech began in the late     s  leading to the first major case against Big Tech in       when the U S  government accused Microsoft of illegally maintaining its monopoly position in the PC market 
Microsoft imposed legal and technical restrictions on PC manufacturers and users preventing them from uninstalling Internet Explorer and using Netscape or Java  The district court ruled that Microsoft s actions constituted monopolization under the Sherman Antitrust Act  and the U S  Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit affirmed most of the district court s judgments  The Department of Justice  DOJ  announced on September          that it would not seek to break up Microsoft  and would instead seek a lesser penalty if Microsoft agreed to share its APIs with third party companies and appoint a three person panel with access to Microsoft s systems  records  and source code for five years  On November          Judge Kollar Kotelly accepted most of the proposed settlement  and on June           the U S  appeals court unanimously approved the settlement              
In the late     s  Big Tech was investigated by the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission  FTC  for anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions  Some Democratic presidential candidates proposed breaking up Big Tech companies or regulating them as utilities  FTC chairman Joseph Simons said   The role of technology in the economy and in our lives grows more important every day   As I ve noted in the past  it makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition                             In       Elizabeth Warren criticized Big Tech for offering free services to remain more popular than the competition               The United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust  Commercial and Administrative Law investigated Big Tech in June       and published a report in January      concluding that Amazon  Apple  Google  and Meta operated in an anticompetitive manner                           
On June           the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust  Commercial and Administrative Law held hearings on proposed Big Tech regulations  Pramila Jayapal introduced HR       The Ending Platform Monopolies Act  which passed the committee               The bill proposed prohibiting platform owners from offering products and services on the platforms they own  For example  in       Amazon attempted to acquire Diapers com  When Diapers com rejected Amazon s proposal  Amazon started selling diapers at a loss  Facing unprofitability  Diapers com agreed to let Amazon buy the company even though Walmart was willing to pay more               The committee voted that the reason for Big Tech monopolies is because of the consumer welfare standard  a legal doctrine stating that if the consumer benefits from corporate actions  those actions are generally legal  FTC chairwoman Lina Khan expressed a different view in her publication  Amazon s Antitrust Paradox  
On July          President Joe Biden signed Executive Order         Promoting Competition in the American Economy   a sweeping array of initiatives across the executive branch  The order established an executive branch wide policy to more thoroughly scrutinize mergers involving Big Tech companies  with focus on the acquisition of new  potentially disruptive technology from smaller companies by the larger companies  The order also instructed the FTC to establish rules related to the use of data collection by Big Tech companies for promoting their own services                            In June       the DOJ and FTC opened an investigation into Microsoft  Nvidia  and OpenAI regarding their dominance in artificial intelligence                            In August       District of Columbia U S  District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google held a monopoly in online search and text advertising in violation of Section   of the Sherman Antitrust Act                            In April       Eastern Virginia U S  District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that Google held a monopoly in advertising technology in violation of Sections   and   of the Sherman Antitrust Act                           

European Union edit 
Further information  Microsoft Corp  v  Commission
The European Commission  which has imposed sanctions on several of the high tech giants
In June       the European Union opened two investigations into Apple  The first investigation focused on whether Apple uses market dominance to stifle competition in music and book streaming  The second investigation focused on Apple Pay  Apple limits the use of the iPhone s NFC technology by financial institutions  including banks                           
According to European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager  fines are insufficient to deter anticompetitive practices  Vestager stated   Fines are not doing the trick  And fines are not enough because fines are a punishment for illegal behaviour in the past  What is also in our decision is that you have to change for the future  You have to stop what you re doing               
In September       the United States and European Union began negotiating a joint approach to Big Tech regulation               The European Parliament passed the Digital Markets Act  DMA  in March      to restrict data collection from European users  require social media interoperability  and allow alternative app stores and payment systems for Apple and Google smartphones                            The EU also passed the Digital Services Act  DSA  in April       which requires tech companies to take down hate speech and child sexual abuse  and ban advertising targeting gender  race  religion  and childhood               Both the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act were enacted by the EU in July                    The EU defined Alphabet  Amazon  Apple  ByteDance  Meta  and Microsoft as  gatekeepers  under the DMA in September       and required them to comply by March                    On June           the European Union charged Apple with breaching the Digital Markets Act  potentially resulting in a significant fine  A final decision is expected by March       The EU is also investigating Apple s new terms and fees for app developers  criticizing the company s restrictions and handling of AI powered features in the EU              

Alternatives edit 
Main articles  Alt tech  Fediverse  and Web 
Alt tech is a collection of social networking services and Internet service providers popular among the alt right  far right  and others who espouse extremism or fringe theories  typically because they employ looser content moderation than mainstream platforms                                         The term  alt tech  is a portmanteau of  alt right  and  Big Tech
