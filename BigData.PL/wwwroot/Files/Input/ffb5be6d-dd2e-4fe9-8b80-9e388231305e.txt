Mutation and selection

Selective breeding  also called artificial selection  is the process by which humans use animal breeding and plant breeding to selectively develop particular phenotypic traits  characteristics  by choosing which typically animal or plant males and females will sexually reproduce and have offspring together  Domesticated animals are known as breeds  normally bred by a professional breeder  while domesticated plants are known as varieties  cultigens  cultivars  or breeds             Two purebred animals of different breeds produce a crossbreed  and crossbred plants are called hybrids  Flowers  vegetables and fruit trees may be bred by amateurs and commercial or non commercial professionals  major crops are usually the provenance of the professionals 
In animal breeding artificial selection is often combined with techniques such as inbreeding  linebreeding  and outcrossing  In plant breeding  similar methods are used  Charles Darwin discussed how selective breeding had been successful in producing change over time in his      book  On the Origin of Species  Its first chapter discusses selective breeding and domestication of such animals as pigeons  cats  cattle  and dogs  Darwin used artificial selection as an analogy to propose and explain the theory of natural selection but distinguished the latter from the former as a separate process that is non directed                                  
The deliberate exploitation of selective breeding to produce desired results has become very common in agriculture and experimental biology 
Selective breeding can be unintentional  for example  resulting from the process of human cultivation  and it may also produce unintended   desirable or undesirable   results  For example  in some grains  an increase in seed size may have resulted from certain ploughing practices rather than from the intentional selection of larger seeds  Most likely  there has been an interdependence between natural and artificial factors that have resulted in plant domestication            


History edit 
Selective breeding of both plants and animals has been practiced since  prehistory  key species such as wheat  rice  and dogs have been significantly different from their wild ancestors for millennia  and maize  which required especially large changes from teosinte  its wild form  was selectively bred in Mesoamerica  Selective breeding was practiced by the Romans             Treatises as much as       years old give advice on selecting animals for different purposes  and these ancient works cite still older authorities  such as Mago the Carthaginian             The notion of selective breeding was later expressed by the Persian Muslim polymath Abu Rayhan Biruni in the   th century  He noted the idea in his book titled India  which included various examples            

The agriculturist selects his corn  letting grow as much as he requires  and tearing out the remainder  The forester leaves those branches which he perceives to be excellent  whilst he cuts away all others  The bees kill those of their kind who only eat  but do not work in their beehive         Abu Rayhan Biruni  India
Selective breeding was established as a scientific practice by Robert Bakewell during the British Agricultural Revolution in the   th century   Arguably  his most important breeding program was with sheep  Using native stock  he was able to quickly select for large  yet fine boned sheep  with long  lustrous wool  The Lincoln Longwool was improved by Bakewell  and in turn the Lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed  named the New  or Dishley  Leicester  It was hornless and had a square  meaty body with straight top lines            
These sheep were exported widely  including to Australia and North America  and have contributed to numerous modern breeds  despite the fact that they fell quickly out of favor as market preferences in meat and textiles changed  Bloodlines of these original New Leicesters survive today as the English Leicester  or Leicester Longwool   which is primarily kept for wool production 
Bakewell was also the first to breed cattle to be used primarily for beef  Previously  cattle were first and foremost kept for pulling ploughs as oxen              but he crossed long horned heifers and a Westmoreland bull to eventually create the Dishley Longhorn  As more and more farmers followed his lead  farm animals increased dramatically in size and quality  In       the average weight of a bull sold for slaughter was     pounds           kg   By       that weight had more than doubled to     pounds           kg   However  after his death  the Dishley Longhorn was replaced with short horn versions 
He also bred the Improved Black Cart horse  which later became the Shire horse 
Charles Darwin coined the term  selective breeding   he was interested in the process as an illustration of his proposed wider process of natural selection  Darwin noted that many domesticated animals and plants had special properties that were developed by intentional animal and plant breeding from individuals that showed desirable characteristics  and discouraging the breeding of individuals with less desirable characteristics 
Darwin used the term  artificial selection  twice in the      first edition of his work On the Origin of Species  in Chapter IV  Natural Selection  and in Chapter VI  Difficulties on Theory 

Slow though the process of selection may be  if feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection  I can see no limit to the amount of change  to the beauty and infinite complexity of the co adaptations between all organic beings  one with another and with their physical conditions of life  which may be effected in the long course of time by nature s power of selection                     Charles Darwin  On the Origin of Species
We are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations  and we are immediately made conscious of this by reflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals in different countries  more especially in the less civilized countries where there has been but little artificial selection                     Charles Darwin  On the Origin of Species
Animal breeding edit 
Main article  Animal breeding
Animals with homogeneous appearance  behavior  and other characteristics are known as particular breeds or pure breeds  and they are bred through culling animals with particular traits and selecting for further breeding those with other traits  Purebred animals have a single  recognizable breed  and purebreds with recorded lineage are called pedigreed  Crossbreeds are a mix of two purebreds  whereas mixed breeds are a mix of several breeds  often unknown  Animal breeding begins with breeding stock  a group of animals used for the purpose of planned breeding  When individuals are looking to breed animals  they look for certain valuable traits in purebred stock for a certain purpose  or may intend to use some type of crossbreeding to produce a new type of stock with different  and  it is presumed  superior abilities in a given area of endeavor  For example  to breed chickens  a breeder typically intends to receive eggs  meat  and new  young birds for further reproduction  Thus  the breeder has to study different breeds and types of chickens and analyze what can be expected from a certain set of characteristics before he or she starts breeding them  Therefore  when purchasing initial breeding stock  the breeder seeks a group of birds that will most closely fit the purpose intended 
Purebred breeding aims to establish and maintain stable traits  that animals will pass to the next generation  By  breeding the best to the best   employing a certain degree of inbreeding  considerable culling  and selection for  superior  qualities  one could develop a bloodline superior in certain respects to the original base stock  Such animals can be recorded with a breed registry  the organization that maintains pedigrees and or stud books  However  single trait breeding  breeding for only one trait over all others  can be problematic              In one case mentioned by animal behaviorist Temple Grandin  roosters bred for fast growth or heavy muscles did not know how to perform typical rooster courtship dances  which alienated the roosters from hens and led the roosters to kill the hens after mating with them              A Soviet attempt to breed lab rats with higher intelligence led to cases of neurosis severe enough to make the animals incapable of any problem solving unless drugs like phenazepam were used             
The observable phenomenon of hybrid vigor stands in contrast to the notion of breed purity  However  on the other hand  indiscriminate breeding of crossbred or hybrid animals may also result in degradation of quality  Studies in evolutionary physiology  behavioral genetics  and other areas of organismal biology have also made use of deliberate selective breeding  though longer generation times and greater difficulty in breeding can make these projects challenging in such vertebrates as house mice                                     

Plant breeding edit 
Main article  Plant breeding
Researchers at the USDA have selectively bred carrots with a variety of colors 
The process of plant breeding has been used for thousands of years  and began with the domestication of wild plants into uniform and predictable agricultural cultigens   These high yielding varieties have been particularly important in agriculture  As crops improved  humans were able to move from hunter gatherer style living to a mix of hunter gatherer and agriculture practices              Although these higher yielding plants were derived from an extremely primitive version of plant breeding  this form of agriculture was an investment that the people who grew them were planting then could have a more varied diet  This meant that they did not completely stop their hunting and gathering immediately but instead over time transition and ultimately favored agriculture              Originally this was due to humans not wanting to risk using all their time and resources for their crops just to fail  Which was promptly called play farming due to the idea of  farmers  experimenting with agriculture              In addition  the ability for humans to stay within one place for food and create permanent settlements made the process move along faster              During this transitional period  crops began to acclimate and evolve with humans encouraging humans to invest further into crops  Over time this reliance on plant breeding has created problems       as highlighted by the book Botany of Desire where Michael Pollan shows the connection between basic human desires through four different plants  apples for sweetness  tulips for beauty  cannabis for intoxication  and potatoes for control  In a form of reciprocal evolution humans have influenced these plants as much as the plants have influenced the people that consume them  is known as coevolution             
Selective plant breeding is also used in research to produce transgenic animals that breed  true   i e   are homozygous  for artificially inserted or deleted genes             

Selective breeding in aquaculture edit 
Selective breeding in aquaculture holds high potential for the genetic improvement of fish and shellfish for the process of production  Unlike terrestrial livestock  the potential benefits of selective breeding in aquaculture were not realized until recently  This is because high mortality led to the selection of only a few broodstock  causing inbreeding depression  which then forced the use of wild broodstock  This was evident in selective breeding programs for growth rate  which resulted in slow growth and high mortality             
Control of the reproduction cycle was one of the main reasons as it is a requisite for selective breeding programs  Artificial reproduction was not achieved because of the difficulties in hatching or feeding some farmed species such as eel and yellowtail farming             
A suspected reason associated with the late realization of success in selective breeding programs in aquaculture was the education of the concerned people   researchers  advisory personnel and fish farmers  The education of fish biologists paid less attention to quantitative genetics and breeding plans             
Another was the failure of documentation of the genetic gains in successive generations  This in turn led to failure in quantifying economic benefits that successful selective breeding programs produce  Documentation of the genetic changes was considered important as they help in fine tuning further selection schemes             

Quality traits in aquaculture edit 
Aquaculture species are reared for particular traits such as growth rate  survival rate  meat quality  resistance to diseases  age at sexual maturation  fecundity  shell traits like shell size  shell color  etc 

Growth rate   growth rate is normally measured as either body weight or body length  This trait is of great economic importance for all aquaculture species as faster growth rate speeds up the turnover of production              Improved growth rates show that farmed animals utilize their feed more efficiently through a positive correlated response             
Survival rate   survival rate may take into account the degrees of resistance to diseases              This may also see the stress response as fish under stress are highly vulnerable to diseases              The stress fish experience could be of biological  chemical or environmental influence 
Meat quality   the quality of fish is of great economic importance in the market  Fish quality usually takes into account size  meatiness  and percentage of fat  color of flesh  taste  shape of the body  ideal oil and omega   content                         
Age at sexual maturation   The age of maturity in aquaculture species is another very important attribute for farmers as during early maturation the species divert all their energy to gonad production affecting growth and meat production and are more susceptible to health problems  Gjerde       
Fecundity   As the fecundity in fish and shellfish is usually high it is not considered as a major trait for improvement  However  selective breeding practices may consider the size of the egg and correlate it with survival and early growth rate             
Finfish response to selection edit 
Salmonids edit 
Gjedrem        showed that selection of Atlantic salmon  Salmo salar  led to an increase in body weight by     per generation  A comparative study on the performance of select Atlantic salmon with wild fish was conducted by AKVAFORSK Genetics Centre in Norway  The traits  for which the selection was done included growth rate  feed consumption  protein retention  energy retention  and feed conversion efficiency  Selected fish had a twice better growth rate  a     higher feed intake  and an increased protein and energy retention  This led to an overall     better Fed Conversion Efficiency as compared to the wild stock              Atlantic salmon have also been selected for resistance to bacterial and viral diseases  Selection was done to check resistance to Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus  IPNV   The results showed       mortality for low resistant species whereas the high resistant species showed       mortality compared to wild species             
Rainbow trout  S  gairdneri  was reported to show large improvements in growth rate after      generations of selection              Kincaid et al         showed that growth gains by     could be achieved by selectively breeding rainbow trout for three generations              A    increase in growth was recorded per generation for rainbow trout by Kause et al                     
In Japan  high resistance to IPNV in rainbow trout has been achieved by selectively breeding the stock  Resistant strains were found to have an average mortality of      whereas       mortality was observed in a highly sensitive strain             
Coho salmon  Oncorhynchus kisutch  increase in weight was found to be more than     after four generations of selective breeding              In Chile  Neira et al         conducted experiments on early spawning dates in coho salmon  After selectively breeding the fish for four generations  spawning dates were       days earlier             
Cyprinids
Selective breeding programs for the Common carp  Cyprinus carpio  include improvement in growth  shape and resistance to disease  Experiments carried out in the USSR used crossings of broodstocks to increase genetic diversity and then selected the species for traits like growth rate  exterior traits and viability  and or adaptation to environmental conditions like variations in temperature  Kirpichnikov et al                     and Babouchkine                    selected carp for fast growth and tolerance to cold  the Ropsha carp  The results showed a        to       improvement of cold tolerance but did not provide any data for growth rate  An increase in growth rate was observed in the second generation in Vietnam              Moav and Wohlfarth        showed positive results when selecting for slower growth for three generations compared to selecting for faster growth  Schaperclaus        showed resistance to the dropsy disease wherein selected lines suffered low mortality         compared to unselected                   

Channel Catfish edit 
Growth was seen to increase by        in selectively bred Iictalurus punctatus              More recently  the response of the Channel Catfish to selection for improved growth rate was found to be approximately      that is  an average of     per generation 

Shellfish response to selection edit 
Oysters edit 
Selection for live weight of Pacific oysters showed improvements ranging from      to       compared to the wild stock              Sydney rock oysters  Saccostrea commercialis  showed a    increase after one generation and a     increase after two generations                          Chilean oysters  Ostrea chilensis   selected for improvement in live weight and shell length showed a        gain in one generation 
Bonamia ostrea is a protistan parasite that causes catastrophic losses  nearly      in European flat oyster Ostrea edulis L  This protistan parasite is endemic to three oyster regions in Europe  Selective breeding programs show that O  edulis susceptibility to the infection differs across oyster strains in Europe  A study carried out by Culloty et al  showed that  Rossmore  oysters in Cork harbour  Ireland had better resistance compared to other Irish strains  A selective breeding program at Cork harbour uses broodstock from    to   year old survivors and is further controlled until a viable percentage reaches market size                         
Over the years  Rossmore  oysters have shown to develop lower prevalence of B  ostreae infection and percentage mortality  Ragone Calvo et al         selectively bred the eastern oyster  Crassostrea virginica  for resistance against co occurring parasites Haplosporidium nelson  MSX  and Perkinsus marinus  Dermo   They achieved dual resistance to the disease in four generations of selective breeding  The oysters showed higher growth and survival rates and low susceptibility to the infections  At the end of the experiment  artificially selected C  virginica showed a        higher survival rate             

Penaeid shrimps edit 
Selection for growth in Penaeid shrimps yielded successful results  A selective breeding program for Litopenaeus stylirostris saw an     increase in growth after the fourth generation and     growth after the fifth generation              Marsupenaeus japonicas showed a       increase in growth after the first generation              Argue et al         conducted a selective breeding program on the Pacific White Shrimp  Litopenaeus vannamei at The Oceanic Institute  Waimanalo  USA from      to       They reported significant responses to selection compared to the unselected control shrimps  After one generation  a     increase was observed in growth and       increase in survival to TSV              The Taura Syndrome Virus  TSV  causes mortalities of     or more in shrimps  C I  Oceanos S A  in Colombia selected the survivors of the disease from infected ponds and used them as parents for the next generation  They achieved satisfying results in two or three generations wherein survival rates approached levels before the outbreak of the disease              The resulting heavy losses  up to      caused by Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus  IHHNV  caused a number of shrimp farming industries started to selectively breed shrimps resistant to this disease  Successful outcomes led to development of Super Shrimp  a selected line of L  stylirostris that is resistant to IHHNV infection  Tang et al         confirmed this by showing no mortalities in IHHNV  challenged Super Shrimp post larvae and juveniles             

Aquatic species versus terrestrial livestock edit 
Selective breeding programs for aquatic species provide better outcomes compared to terrestrial livestock  This higher response to selection of aquatic farmed species can be attributed to the following 

High fecundity in both sexes fish and shellfish enabling higher selection intensity 
Large phenotypic and genetic variation in the selected traits 
Selective breeding in aquaculture provide remarkable economic benefits to the industry  the primary one being that it reduces production costs due to faster turnover rates  When selective breeding is carried out  some characteristics are lost for others that may suit a specific environment or situation              This is because of faster growth rates  decreased maintenance rates  increased energy and protein retention  and better feed efficiency              Applying genetic improvement programs to aquaculture species will increase their productivity  Thus allowing them to meet the increasing demands of growing populations  Conversely  selective breeding within aquaculture can create problems within the biodiversity of both stock and wild fish  which can hurt the industry down the road  Although there is great potential to improve aquaculture due to the current lack of domestication  it is essential that the genetic diversity of the fish are preserved through proper genetic management  as we domesticate these species              It is not uncommon for fish to escape the nets or pens that they are kept in  especially in mass  If these fish are farmed in areas they are not native to they may be able to establish themselves and outcompete native populations of fish  and cause ecological harm as an invasive species              Furthermore  if they are in areas where the fish being farmed are native too their genetics are selectively bred rather than being wild  These farmed fish could breed with the natives which could be problematic In the sense that they would have been bred for consumption rather than by chance  Resulting in an overall decrease in genetic diversity and rendering local fish populations less fit for survival              If proper management is not taking place then the economic benefits and the diversity of the fish species will falter             

Advantages and disadvantages edit 
Selective breeding is a direct way to determine if a specific trait can evolve in response to selection  A single generation method of breeding is not as accurate or direct  The process is also more practical and easier to understand than sibling analysis  Selective breeding is better for traits such as physiology and behavior that are hard to measure because it requires fewer individuals to test than single generation testing 
However  there are disadvantages to this process  This is because a single experiment done in selective breeding cannot be used to assess an entire group of genetic variances  individual experiments must be done for every individual trait  Also  due to the necessity of selective breeding experiments to require maintaining the organisms tested in a lab or greenhouse  it is impractical to use this breeding method on many organisms  Controlled mating instances are difficult to carry out in this case and this is a necessary component of selective breeding             
Additionally  selective breeding can lead to a variety of issues including reduction of genetic diversity or physical problems  The process of selective breeding can create physical issues for plants or animals such as dogs selectively bred for extremely small sizes dislocating their kneecaps at a much more frequent rate then other dogs              An example in the plant world is the Lenape potatoes were selectively bred for their disease or pest resistance which was attributed to their high levels of toxic glycoalkaloid solanine which are usually present only in small amounts in potatoes fit for human consumption              When genetic diversity is lost it can also allow for populations to lack genetic alternatives to adapt to events  This becomes an issue of biodiversity  because attributes are so wide spread they can result in mass epidemics  As seen in the Southern Corn leaf blight epidemic of      that wiped out     of the United States corn crop due to the wide use of a type of Texan corn strain that was artificially selected due to having sterile pollen to make farming easier  At the same time it was more vulnerable to Southern Corn leaf blight
