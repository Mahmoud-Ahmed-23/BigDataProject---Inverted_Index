Further information  Foreign interference in the      United States elections
Officials from the ODNI and FBI have stated that Russia  Iran  and China used generative artificial intelligence tools to create fake and divisive text  photos  video  and audio content to foster anti Americanism and engage in covert influence campaigns              The use of artificial intelligence was described as an accelerant rather than a revolutionary change to influence efforts              Regulation of AI with regard to elections was unlikely to see a resolution for most of the      United States general election season

By governments edit

United States edit 
US states have attempted regulation of AI use in elections and campaigns with varying degrees of success              The National Conference of State Legislatures has compiled a list of legislation regarding AI use by state as of       some carrying both civil and criminal penalties              Oregon Senate Bill      requires that campaign communications in Oregon disclose the use of AI                                       California has enacted legislation that makes using deepfakes to discredit political opponents illegal within sixty days of an election                         

Self regulation by private firms edit

AI use in election interference by foreign governments edit

AI has begun to be used in election interference by foreign governments                                      Governments thought to be using AI to interfere in external elections include Russia  Iran and China              Russia was thought to be the most prolific nation targeting the      presidential election with their influencing operations  spreading synthetic images  video  audio and text online   according to U S  intelligence officials              Iran has reportedly generated fake social media posts stories and targeted  across the political spectrum on polarizing issues during the presidential election               The Chinese government has used  broader influence operations  that aim to make a global image and  amplify divisive topics in the U S  such as drug use  immigration  and abortion               For example  Spamouflage has increasingly used generative AI for influence operations             
Outside of the US elections  a deepfake video of Moldova s pro Western president Maia Sandu  shows her  throwing her support behind a political party friendly to Russia               Officials in Moldova  believe the Russian government is behind the activity               Slovakia s liberal party leader had audio clips faked which discussed  vote rigging and raising the price of beer               The Chinese government has used AI to stir concerns about US interference in Taiwan              A fake clip seen on social media showed a fake video of the vice chairman of the U S  House Armed Services Committee promising  stronger U S  military support for Taiwan if the incumbent party s candidates were elected in January              

Ethics of AI use in political campaigning edit 
See also  Ethics of artificial intelligence
As the use of AI and its associated tools in political campaigning and messaging increases  many ethical concerns have been raised              Campaigns have used AI in a number of ways  including speech writing  fundraising  voter behaviour prediction  fake robocalls and the generation of fake news              At the moment there are no US federal rules when it comes to using AI in campaigning and so its use can undermine public trust              Yet according to one expert   A lot of the questions we re asking about AI are the same questions we ve asked about rhetoric and persuasion for thousands of years              
As more insight into how AI is used becomes ever greater  concerns have become much broader than just the generating of misinformation or fake news              Its use by politicians and political parties for  purposes that are not overtly malicious  can also raise ethical worries              For instance  the use of  softfakes  have become more common              These can be images  videos or audio clips that have been edited  often by campaign teams   to make a political candidate seem more appealing               An example can be found in  Indonesia s presidential election where the winning candidate created and promoted cartoonish  avatars so as to rebrand himself             
How citizens come by information has been increasingly impacted by AI  especially through online platforms and social media              These platforms are part of complex and opaque systems which can result in a  significant impact on freedom of expression   with the generalisation of AI in campaigns also creating huge pressures on  voters  mental security               As the frequency of AI use in political campaigning becomes common  together with globalization  more  universalized  content can be used so that territorial boundaries matter less              While AI collides with the reasoning processes of people  the creation of  dangerous behaviours  can happen which disrupt important levels of society and nation states
