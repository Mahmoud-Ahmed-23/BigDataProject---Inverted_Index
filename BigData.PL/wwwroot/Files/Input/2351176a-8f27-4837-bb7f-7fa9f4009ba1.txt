Moore s law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit  IC  doubles about every two years  Moore s law is an observation and projection of a historical trend  Rather than a law of physics  it is an empirical relationship  It is an experience curve law  a type of law quantifying efficiency gains from experience in production 
The observation is named after Gordon Moore  the co founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel and former CEO of the latter  who in      noted that the number of components per integrated circuit had been doubling every year      a      and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade  In       looking forward to the next decade  he revised the forecast to doubling every two years  a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of      Moore s empirical evidence did not directly imply that the historical trend would continue  nevertheless  his prediction has held since      and has since become known as a law 
Moore s prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long term planning and to set targets for research and development  R amp D   Advancements in digital electronics  such as the reduction in quality adjusted prices of microprocessors  the increase in memory capacity  RAM and flash   the improvement of sensors  and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras  are strongly linked to Moore s law  These ongoing changes in digital electronics have been a driving force of technological and social change  productivity  and economic growth 
Industry experts have not reached a consensus on exactly when Moore s law will cease to apply  Microprocessor architects report that semiconductor advancement has slowed industry wide since around       slightly below the pace predicted by Moore s law  In September       Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang considered Moore s law dead             while Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was of the opposite view            


History edit 
In       Douglas Engelbart studied the projected downscaling of integrated circuit  IC  size  publishing his results in the article  Microelectronics  and the Art of Similitude                                    Engelbart presented his findings at the      International Solid State Circuits Conference  where Moore was present in the audience            
In       Gordon Moore  who at the time was working as the director of research and development at Fairchild Semiconductor  was asked to contribute to the thirty fifth anniversary issue of Electronics magazine with a prediction on the future of the semiconductor components industry over the next ten years             His response was a brief article entitled  Cramming more components onto integrated circuits                             b      Within his editorial  he speculated that by      it would be possible to contain as many as       components on a single quarter square inch                  cm   semiconductor 

The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year  Certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue  if not to increase  Over the longer term  the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain  although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least    years            
Moore posited a log linear relationship between device complexity  higher circuit density at reduced cost  and time                          In a      interview  Moore noted of the      article            I just did a wild extrapolation saying it s going to continue to double every year for the next    years               One historian of the law cites Stigler s law of eponymy  to introduce the fact that the regular doubling of components was known to many working in the field             
In       Robert H  Dennard at IBM recognized the rapid MOSFET scaling technology and formulated what became known as Dennard scaling  which describes that as MOS transistors get smaller  their power density stays constant such that the power use remains in proportion with area                          Evidence from the semiconductor industry shows that this inverse relationship between power density and areal density broke down in the mid     s             
At the      IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting  Moore revised his forecast rate                          predicting semiconductor complexity would continue to double annually until about       after which it would decrease to a rate of doubling approximately every two years                                      He outlined several contributing factors for this exponential behavior                         

The advent of metal oxide semiconductor  MOS  technology
The exponential rate of increase in die sizes  coupled with a decrease in defective densities  with the result that semiconductor manufacturers could work with larger areas without losing reduction yields
Finer minimum dimensions
What Moore called  circuit and device cleverness 
Shortly after       Caltech professor Carver Mead popularized the term Moore s law                          Moore s law eventually came to be widely accepted as a goal for the semiconductor industry  and it was cited by competitive semiconductor manufacturers as they strove to increase processing power  Moore viewed his eponymous law as surprising and optimistic   Moore s law is a violation of Murphy s law  Everything gets better and better               The observation was even seen as a self fulfilling prophecy                         
The doubling period is often misquoted as    months because of a separate prediction by Moore s colleague  Intel executive David House              In       House noted that Moore s revised law of doubling transistor count every   years in turn implied that computer chip performance would roughly double every    months              with no increase in power consumption              Mathematically  Moore s law predicted that transistor count would double every   years due to shrinking transistor dimensions and other improvements              As a consequence of shrinking dimensions  Dennard scaling predicted that power consumption per unit area would remain constant  Combining these effects  David House deduced that computer chip performance would roughly double every    months  Also due to Dennard scaling  this increased performance would not be accompanied by increased power  i e   the energy efficiency of silicon based computer chips roughly doubles every    months  Dennard scaling ended in the     s              Koomey later showed that a similar rate of efficiency improvement predated silicon chips and Moore s law  for technologies such as vacuum tubes 

A      Osborne Executive portable computer  with a        MHz   bit Zilog Z   CPU  and a      Apple iPhone with a          MHz    bit ARM   CPU  the Executive has     times the weight  almost     times the volume  approximately    times the inflation adjusted cost  and      th the clock frequency of the smartphone 
Microprocessor architects report that since around       semiconductor advancement has slowed industry wide below the pace predicted by Moore s law              Brian Krzanich  the former CEO of Intel  cited Moore s      revision as a precedent for the current deceleration  which results from technical challenges and is  a natural part of the history of Moore s law                                       The rate of improvement in physical dimensions known as Dennard scaling also ended in the mid     s  As a result  much of the semiconductor industry has shifted its focus to the needs of major computing applications rather than semiconductor scaling                                      Nevertheless  as of       leading semiconductor manufacturers TSMC and Samsung Electronics claimed to keep pace with Moore s law                                                                         with        and        nm nodes in mass production                                                             

Moore s second law edit 
Further information  Moore s second law
As the cost of computer power to the consumer falls  the cost for producers to fulfill Moore s law follows an opposite trend  R amp D  manufacturing  and test costs have increased steadily with each new generation of chips  The cost of the tools  principally extreme ultraviolet lithography  EUVL   used to manufacture chips doubles every   years              Rising manufacturing costs are an important consideration for the sustaining of Moore s law              This led to the formulation of Moore s second law  also called Rock s law  named after Arthur Rock   which is that the capital cost of a semiconductor fabrication plant also increases exponentially over time

The physical limits to transistor scaling have been reached due to source to drain leakage  limited gate metals and limited options for channel material  Other approaches are being investigated  which do not rely on physical scaling  These include the spin state of electron spintronics  tunnel junctions  and advanced confinement of channel materials via nano wire geometry               Spin based logic and memory options are being developed actively in labs                           

Alternative materials research edit 
The vast majority of current transistors on ICs are composed principally of doped silicon and its alloys  As silicon is fabricated into single nanometer transistors  short channel effects adversely changes desired material properties of silicon as a functional transistor  Below are several non silicon substitutes in the fabrication of small nanometer transistors 
One proposed material is indium gallium arsenide  or InGaAs  Compared to their silicon and germanium counterparts  InGaAs transistors are more promising for future high speed  low power logic applications  Because of intrinsic characteristics of III V compound semiconductors  quantum well and tunnel effect transistors based on InGaAs have been proposed as alternatives to more traditional MOSFET designs 

In the early     s  the atomic layer deposition high   film and pitch double patterning processes were invented by Gurtej Singh Sandhu at Micron Technology  extending Moore s law for planar CMOS technology to         nm class and smaller 
In       Intel announced the development of         nm InGaAs quantum well transistors  Quantum well devices contain a material sandwiched between two layers of material with a wider band gap  Despite being double the size of leading pure silicon transistors at the time  the company reported that they performed equally as well while consuming less power              
In       researchers at Intel demonstrated   D tri gate InGaAs transistors with improved leakage characteristics compared to traditional planar designs  The company claims that their design achieved the best electrostatics of any III V compound semiconductor transistor               At the      International Solid State Circuits Conference  Intel mentioned the use of III V compounds based on such an architecture for their        nm node                           
In       researchers at the University of Texas at Austin developed an InGaAs tunneling field effect transistors capable of higher operating currents than previous designs  The first III V TFET designs were demonstrated in      by a joint team from Cornell University and Pennsylvania State University                           
In       a team in MIT s Microsystems Technology Laboratories developed a         nm transistor based on InGaAs that  at the time  was the smallest non silicon transistor ever built  The team used techniques used in silicon device fabrication and aimed for better electrical performance and a reduction to    nanometer scale              
Biological computing research shows that biological material has superior information density and energy efficiency compared to silicon based computing              

Scanning probe microscopy image of graphene in its hexagonal lattice structure 
Various forms of graphene are being studied for graphene electronics  e g  graphene nanoribbon transistors have shown promise since its appearance in publications in        Bulk graphene has a band gap of zero and thus cannot be used in transistors because of its constant conductivity  an inability to turn off  The zigzag edges of the nanoribbons introduce localized energy states in the conduction and valence bands and thus a bandgap that enables switching when fabricated as a transistor  As an example  a typical GNR of width of         nm has a desirable bandgap energy of          eV                             More research will need to be performed  however  on sub         nm graphene layers  as its resistivity value increases and thus electron mobility decreases              

Forecasts and roadmaps edit 
In April       Gordon Moore stated in an interview that the projection cannot be sustained indefinitely   It can t continue forever  The nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens   He also noted that transistors eventually would reach the limits of miniaturization at atomic levels 

In terms of size  of transistors  you can see that we re approaching the size of atoms which is a fundamental barrier  but it ll be two or three generations before we get that far but that s as far out as we ve ever been able to see  We have another    to    years before we reach a fundamental limit  By then they ll be able to make bigger chips and have transistor budgets in the billions                      Gordon Moore in     In      the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors  after using Moore s Law to drive the industry since       produced its final roadmap  It no longer centered its research and development plan on Moore s law  Instead  it outlined what might be called the More than Moore strategy in which the needs of applications drive chip development  rather than a focus on semiconductor scaling  Application drivers range from smartphones to AI to data centers              
IEEE began a road mapping initiative in       Rebooting Computing  named the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems  IRDS               
Some forecasters  including Gordon Moore               predict that Moore s law will end by around                                              Although Moore s Law will reach a physical limit  some forecasters are optimistic about the continuation of technological progress in a variety of other areas  including new chip architectures  quantum computing  and AI and machine learning                            Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared Moore s law dead in                  several days later  Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger countered with the opposite claim            

Consequences edit 
Digital electronics have contributed to world economic growth in the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries               The primary driving force of economic growth is the growth of productivity               which Moore s law factors into  Moore        expected that  the rate of technological progress is going to be controlled from financial realities                The reverse could and did occur around the late     s  however  with economists reporting that  Productivity growth is the key economic indicator of innovation                Moore s law describes a driving force of technological and social change  productivity  and economic growth                                        
An acceleration in the rate of semiconductor progress contributed to a surge in U S  productivity growth                                         which reached      per year in            outpacing the      per year during both           and                         As economist Richard G  Anderson notes   Numerous studies have traced the cause of the productivity acceleration to technological innovations in the production of semiconductors that sharply reduced the prices of such components and of the products that contain them  as well as expanding the capabilities of such products                
The primary negative implication of Moore s law is that obsolescence pushes society up against the Limits to Growth  As technologies continue to rapidly improve  they render predecessor technologies obsolete  In situations in which security and survivability of hardware or data are paramount  or in which resources are limited  rapid obsolescence often poses obstacles to smooth or continued operations

Other formulations and similar observations edit 
Several measures of digital technology are improving at exponential rates related to Moore s law  including the size  cost  density  and speed of components  Moore wrote only about the density of components   a component being a transistor  resistor  diode or capacitor                at minimum cost 
Transistors per integrated circuit   The most popular formulation is of the doubling of the number of transistors on ICs every two years  At the end of the     s  Moore s law became known as the limit for the number of transistors on the most complex chips  The graph at the top of this article shows this trend holds true today  As of          update       the commercially available processor possessing one of the highest numbers of transistors is a GB    graphics processor with more than           billion transistors              
Density at minimum cost per transistor   This is the formulation given in Moore s      paper             It is not just about the density of transistors that can be achieved  but about the density of transistors at which the cost per transistor is the lowest              
As more transistors are put on a chip  the cost to make each transistor decreases  but the chance that the chip will not work due to a defect increases  In       Moore examined the density of transistors at which cost is minimized  and observed that  as transistors were made smaller through advances in photolithography  this number would increase at  a rate of roughly a factor of two per year             
Dennard scaling   This posits that power usage would decrease in proportion to area  both voltage and current being proportional to length  of transistors  Combined with Moore s law  performance per watt would grow at roughly the same rate as transistor density  doubling every     years  According to Dennard scaling transistor dimensions would be scaled by            every technology generation  thus reducing their area by      This would reduce the delay by            and therefore increase operating frequency by about             Finally  to keep electric field constant  voltage would be reduced by      reducing energy by     and power  at      frequency  by          c      Therefore  in every technology generation transistor density would double  circuit becomes     faster  while power consumption  with twice the number of transistors  stays the same               Dennard scaling ended in            due to leakage currents             
The exponential processor transistor growth predicted by Moore does not always translate into exponentially greater practical CPU performance  Since around            Dennard scaling has ended  so even though Moore s law continued after that  it has not yielded proportional dividends in improved performance                           The primary reason cited for the breakdown is that at small sizes  current leakage poses greater challenges  and also causes the chip to heat up  which creates a threat of thermal runaway and therefore  further increases energy costs                                      
The breakdown of Dennard scaling prompted a greater focus on multicore processors  but the gains offered by switching to more cores are lower than the gains that would be achieved had Dennard scaling continued                            In another departure from Dennard scaling  Intel microprocessors adopted a non planar tri gate FinFET at         nm in      that is faster and consumes less power than a conventional planar transistor               The rate of performance improvement for single core microprocessors has slowed significantly               Single core performance was improving by     per year in           and     per year in            but slowed to just seven percent per year in                        
Quality adjusted price of IT equipment   The price of information technology  IT   computers and peripheral equipment  adjusted for quality and inflation  declined     per year on average over the five decades from      to                                 The pace accelerated  however  to     per year in           triggered by faster IT innovation               and later  slowed to    per year in                                     
While quality adjusted microprocessor price improvement continues               the rate of improvement likewise varies  and is not linear on a log scale  Microprocessor price improvement accelerated during the late     s  reaching     per year  halving every nine months  versus the typical     improvement rate  halving every two years  during the years earlier and later                            Laptop microprocessors in particular improved        per year in            and slowed to        per year in                        
The number of transistors per chip cannot explain quality adjusted microprocessor prices fully                                         Moore s      paper does not limit Moore s law to strict linearity or to transistor count   The definition of  Moore s Law  has come to refer to almost anything related to the semiconductor industry that on a semi log plot approximates a straight line  I hesitate to review its origins and by doing so restrict its definition               
Hard disk drive areal density   A similar prediction  sometimes called Kryder s law  was made in      for hard disk drive areal density               The prediction was later viewed as over optimistic  Several decades of rapid progress in areal density slowed around       from    to      per year to        per year  because of noise related to smaller grain size of the disk media  thermal stability  and writability using available magnetic fields                           
Fiber optic capacity   The number of bits per second that can be sent down an optical fiber increases exponentially  faster than Moore s law  Keck s law  in honor of Donald Keck              
Network capacity   According to Gerald Butters                            the former head of Lucent s Optical Networking Group at Bell Labs  there is another version  called Butters  Law of Photonics               a formulation that deliberately parallels Moore s law  Butters  law says that the amount of data coming out of an optical fiber is doubling every nine months               Thus  the cost of transmitting a bit over an optical network decreases by half every nine months  The availability of wavelength division multiplexing  sometimes called WDM  increased the capacity that could be placed on a single fiber by as much as a factor of      Optical networking and dense wavelength division multiplexing  DWDM  is rapidly bringing down the cost of networking  and further progress seems assured  As a result  the wholesale price of data traffic collapsed in the dot com bubble  Nielsen s Law says that the bandwidth available to users increases by     annually              
Pixels per dollar   Similarly  Barry Hendy of Kodak Australia has plotted pixels per dollar as a basic measure of value for a digital camera  demonstrating the historical linearity  on a log scale  of this market and the opportunity to predict the future trend of digital camera price  LCD and LED screens  and resolution                                                     
The great Moore s law compensator  TGMLC   also known as Wirth s law   generally is referred to as software bloat and is the principle that successive generations of computer software increase in size and complexity  thereby offsetting the performance gains predicted by Moore s law  In a      article in InfoWorld  Randall C  Kennedy               formerly of Intel  introduces this term using successive versions of Microsoft Office between the year      and      as his premise  Despite the gains in computational performance during this time period according to Moore s law  Office      performed the same task at half the speed on a prototypical year      computer as compared to Office      on a year      computer 
Library expansion   was calculated in      by Fremont Rider to double in capacity every    years  if sufficient space were made available               He advocated replacing bulky  decaying printed works with miniaturized microform analog photographs  which could be duplicated on demand for library patrons or other institutions  He did not foresee the digital technology that would follow decades later to replace analog microform with digital imaging  storage  and transmission media  Automated  potentially lossless digital technologies allowed vast increases in the rapidity of information growth in an era that now sometimes is called the Information Age 
Carlson curve   is a term coined by The Economist              to describe the biotechnological equivalent of Moore s law  and is named after author Rob Carlson               Carlson accurately predicted that the doubling time of DNA sequencing technologies  measured by cost and performance  would be at least as fast as Moore s law               Carlson Curves illustrate the rapid  in some cases hyperexponential  decreases in cost  and increases in performance  of a variety of technologies  including DNA sequencing  DNA synthesis  and a range of physical and computational tools used in protein expression and in determining protein structures 
Eroom s law   is a pharmaceutical drug development observation that was deliberately written as Moore s Law spelled backward in order to contrast it with the exponential advancements of other forms of technology  such as transistors  over time  It states that the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubles every nine years 
Experience curve effects says that each doubling of the cumulative production of virtually any product or service is accompanied by an approximate constant percentage reduction in the unit cost  The acknowledged first documented qualitative description of this dates from                                 A power curve was used to describe this phenomenon in a      discussion of the cost of airplanes              
Edholm s law   Phil Edholm observed that the bandwidth of telecommunication networks  including the Internet  is doubling every    months               The bandwidths of online communication networks has risen from bits per second to terabits per second  The rapid rise in online bandwidth is largely due to the same MOSFET scaling that enabled Moore s law  as telecommunications networks are built from MOSFETs              
Haitz s law predicts that the brightness of LEDs increases as their manufacturing cost goes down 
Swanson s law is the observation that the price of solar photovoltaic modules tends to drop    percent for every doubling of cumulative shipped volume  At present rates  costs go down     about every    years
