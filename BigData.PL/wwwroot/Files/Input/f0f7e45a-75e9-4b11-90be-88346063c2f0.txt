Artificial intelligence  AI  is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it  AI textbooks define the field as  the study and design of intelligent agents  where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success  John McCarthy  who coined the term in       defines it as  the science and engineering of making intelligent machines  
Other definitions avoid attributing the quality of intelligence to the computational capacity of machines or software  Jo Adetunji  Editor  The Conversation UK  wrote that the concept of artificial intelligence is being used abusively or  in other words  there is an inflation of the term that harms its realization  reference here

There is one view that we can allow these AI  tools  to deal with data and analytics and we let people deal with the caring  and the empathy  and the emotional aspects of care  which I think is absolutely critical    What if technology is capable of high touch engagement  What if AI was also social and emotionally intelligent    For me when I talk about emotional engagement  it s not just about great user experience with technology    It is about deeper human engagement to enable transformative change in people s lives    We have the world of design and we have the world of AI and right now those two aren t built top of each other    But these have to come together  So we  through a lot of psychology  understand how people are thinking about experiencing new technology

We refer to the question  What sort of creature man s next successor in the supremacy of the earth is likely to be  We have often heard this debated  but it appears to us that we are ourselves creating our own successors  we are daily adding to the beauty and delicacy of their physical organisation we are daily giving them greater power and supplying by all sorts of ingenious contrivances that self regulating  self acting power  which will be to them what intellect has been to the human race  In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race  Inferior in power  inferior in that moral quality of self control  we shall look up to them as the acme of all that the best and wisest man can ever dare to aim at  No evil passions  no jealousy  no avarice  no impure desires will disturb the serene might of those glorious creatures  Sin  shame  and sorrow will have no place among them  Their minds will be in a state of perpetual calm  the contentment of a spirit that knows no wants  is disturbed by no regrets  Ambition will never torture them  Ingratitude will never cause them the uneasiness of a moment  The guilty conscience  the hope deferred  the pains of exile  the insolence of office  and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes these will be entirely unknown to them 
Samuel Butler   Darwin among the Machines  The Press   June          
 There is no security  to quote his own words  against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness  in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now  A mollusc has not much consciousness  Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years  and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing  The more highly organized machines are creatures not so much of yesterday  as of the last five minutes  so to speak  in comparison with past time 
Samuel Butler  Erewhon  Or  Over the Range       
 Either   he proceeds   a great deal of action that has been called purely mechanical and unconscious must be admitted to contain more elements of consciousness than has been allowed hitherto  and in this case germs of consciousness will be found in many actions of the higher machines  Or  assuming the theory of evolution but at the same time denying the consciousness of vegetable and crystalline action  the race of man has descended from things which had no consciousness at all  In this case there is no   priori improbability in the descent of conscious  and more than conscious  machines from those which now exist  except that which is suggested by the apparent absence of anything like a reproductive system in the mechanical kingdom 
Samuel Butler  Erewhon  Or  Over the Range       
 Herein lies our danger  For many seem inclined to acquiesce in so dishonourable a future  They say that although man should become to the machines what the horse and dog are to us  yet that he will continue to exist  and will probably be better off in a state of domestication under the beneficent rule of the machines than in his present wild condition  We treat our domestic animals with much kindness  We give them whatever we believe to be the best for them  and there can be no doubt that our use of meat has increased their happiness rather than detracted from it  In like manner there is reason to hope that the machines will use us kindly  for their existence will be in a great measure dependent upon ours  they will rule us with a rod of iron  but they will not eat us  they will not only require our services in the reproduction and education of their young  but also in waiting upon them as servants  in gathering food for them  and feeding them  in restoring them to health when they are sick  and in either burying their dead or working up their deceased members into new forms of mechanical existence 
Samuel Butler  Erewhon  Or  Over the Range       
The power of custom is enormous  and so gradual will be the change  that man s sense of what is due to himself will be at no time rudely shocked  our bondage will steal upon us noiselessly and by imperceptible approaches  nor will there ever be such a clashing of desires between man and the machines as will lead to an encounter between them  Among themselves the machines will war eternally  but they will still require man as the being through whose agency the struggle will be principally conducted  In point of fact there is no occasion for anxiety about the future happiness of man so long as he continues to be in any way profitable to the machines  he may become the inferior race  but he will be infinitely better off than he is now  Is it not then both absurd and unreasonable to be envious of our benefactors  And should we not be guilty of consummate folly if we were to reject advantages which we cannot obtain otherwise  merely because they involve a greater gain to others than to ourselves  With those who can argue in this way I have nothing in common  I shrink with as much horror from believing that my race can ever be superseded or surpassed  as I should do from believing that even at the remotest period my ancestors were other than human beings  Could I believe that ten hundred thousand years ago a single one of my ancestors was another kind of being to myself  I should lose all self respect  and take no further pleasure or interest in life  I have the same feeling with regard to my descendants  and believe it to be one that will be felt so generally that the country will resolve upon putting an immediate stop to all further mechanical progress  and upon destroying all improvements that have been made for the last three hundred years  I would not urge more than this  We may trust ourselves to deal with those that remain  and though I should prefer to have seen the destruction include another two hundred years  I am aware of the necessity for compromising  and would so far sacrifice my own individual convictions as to be content with three hundred  Less than this will be insufficient

I have grown accustomed to the disrespect expressed by some of the participants for their colleagues in the other disciplines   Why  Dan   ask the people in artificial intelligence   do you waste your time conferring with those neuroscientists  They wave their hands about  information processing  and worry about where it happens  and which neurotransmitters are involved  but they haven t a clue about the computational requirements of higher cognitive functions    Why   ask the neuroscientists   do you waste your time on the fantasies of artificial intelligence  They just invent whatever machinery they want  and say unpardonably ignorant things about the brain   The cognitive psychologists  meanwhile  are accused of concocting models with neither biological plausibility nor proven computational powers  the anthropologists wouldn t know a model if they saw one  and the philosophers  as we all know  just take in each other s laundry  warning about confusions they themselves have created  in an arena bereft of both data and empirically testable theories  With so many idiots working on the problem  no wonder consciousness is still a mystery  All these charges are true  and more besides  but I have yet to encounter any idiots  Mostly the theorists I have drawn from strike me as very smart people         even brilliant people  with the arrogance and impatience that often comes with brilliance         but with limited perspectives and agendas  trying to make progress on the hard problems by taking whatever shortcuts they can see  while deploring other people s shortcuts  No one can keep all the problems and details clear  including me  and everyone has to mumble  guess and handwave about large parts of the problem

What often happens is that an engineer has an idea of how the brain works  in his opinion  and then designs a machine that behaves that way  This new machine may in fact work very well  But  I must warn you that that does not tell us anything about how the brain actually works  nor is it necessary to ever really know that  in order to make a computer very capable  It is not necessary to understand the way birds flap their wings and how the feathers are designed in order to make a flying machine  It is not necessary to understand the lever system in the legs of a cheetah   in order to make an automobile with wheels that go very fast  It is therefore not necessary to imitate the behavior of Nature in detail in order to engineer a device which can in many respects surpass Nature s abilities

Another scientific development that we find difficult to absorb into our traditional value system is the new science of cybernetics  machines that may soon equal or surpass man in original thinking and problem solving        In the hands of the present establishment there is no doubt that the machine could be used   is being used   to intensify the apparatus of repression and to increase established power  But again  as in the issue of population control  misuse of science has often obscured the value of science itself  In this case  though perhaps the response may not be quite so hysterical and evasive  we still often have the same unimaginative concentration on the evils of the machine itself  rather than a recognition of its revolutionary significance

As difficult as the pursuit of truth can be for Wikipedians  though  it seems significantly harder for A I  chatbots  ChatGPT has become infamous for generating fictional data points or false citations known as  hallucinations   perhaps more insidious is the tendency of bots to oversimplify complex issues  like the origins of the Ukraine Russia war  for example  One worry about generative A I  at Wikipedia   whose articles on medical diagnoses and treatments are heavily visited   is related to health information  A summary of the March conference call captures the issue   We re putting people s lives in the hands of this technology   e g  people might ask this technology for medical advice  it may be wrong and people will die    This apprehension extends not just to chatbots but also to new search engines connected to A I  technologies  In April  a team of Stanford University scientists evaluated four engines powered by A I    Bing Chat  NeevaAI  perplexity ai and YouChat   and found that only about half of the sentences generated by the search engines in response to a query could be fully supported by factual citations   We believe that these results are concerningly low for systems that may serve as a primary tool for information seeking users   the researchers concluded   especially given their facade of trustworthiness

What makes the goal of accuracy so vexing for chatbots is that they operate probabilistically when choosing the next word in a sentence  they aren t trying to find the light of truth in a murky world   These models are built to generate text that sounds like what a person would say   that s the key thing   Jesse Dodge says   So they re definitely not built to be truthful   I asked Margaret Mitchell  a computer scientist who studied the ethics of A I  at Google  whether factuality should have been a more fundamental priority for A I  Mitchell  who has said she was fired from the company for criticizing how it treated colleagues working on bias in A I   Google says she was fired for violating the company s security policies   said that most would find that logical   This common sense thing    Shouldn t we work on making it factual if we re putting it forward for fact based applications     well  I think for most people who are not in tech  it s like   Why is this even a question    But  Mitchell said  the priorities at the big companies  now in frenzied competition with one another  are concerned with introducing A I  products rather than reliability   The road ahead will almost certainly lead to improvements  Mitchell  who now works as the chief ethics scientist at the A I  company Hugging Face  told me that she foresees A I  companies  making gains in accuracy and reducing biased answers by using better data   The state of the art until now has just been a laissez faire data approach   she said   You just throw everything in  and you re operating with a mind set where the more data you have  the more accurate your system will be  as opposed to the higher quality of data you have  the more accurate your system will be   Jesse Dodge  for his part  points to an idea known as  retrieval   whereby a chatbot will essentially consult a high quality source on the web to fact check an answer in real time  It would even cite precise links  as some A I  powered search engines now do   Without that retrieval element   Dodge says   I don t think there s a way to solve the hallucination problem   Otherwise  he says  he doubts that a chatbot answer can gain factual parity with Wikipedia or the Encyclopaedia Britannica

Suppose now that the computer scientists do not succeed in developing artificial intelligence  so that human work remains necessary  Even so  machines will take care of more and more of the simpler tasks so that there will be an increasing surplus of human workers at the lower levels of ability   We see this happening already  There are many people who find it difficult or impossible to get work  because for intellectual or psychological reasons they cannot acquire the level of training necessary to make themselves useful in the present system       Of course  life will be so purposeless that people will have to be biologically or psychologically engineered either to remove their need for the power process or to make them  sublimate  their drive for power into some harmless hobby  These engineered human beings may be happy in such a society  but they most certainly will not be free  They will have been reduced to the status of domestic animals      I visualize a time when we will be to robots what dogs are to humans  and I m rooting for the machines

It s important to understand that in order to make people superfluous  machines will not have to surpass them in general intelligence but only in certain specialized kinds of intelligence  For example  the machines will not have to create or understand art  music  or literature  they will not need the ability to carry on an intelligent  non technical conversation  the  Turing test    they will not have to exercise tact or understand human nature  because these skills will have no application if humans are to be eliminated anyway  To make humans superfluous  the machines will only need to outperform them in making the technical decisions that have to be made for the purpose of promoting the short term survival and propagation of the dominant self prop systems

The problems of heuristic programming of making computers solve really difficult problems are divided into five main areas  Search  Pattern Recognition  Learning  Planning  and Induction  A computer can do  in a sense  only what it is told to do  But even when we do not know how to solve a certain problem  we may program a machine  computer  to Search through some large space of solution attempts  Unfortunately  this usually leads to an enormously inefficient process  With Pattern Recognition techniques  efficiency can often be improved  by restricting the application of the machine s methods to appropriate problems  Pattern Recognition  together with Learning  can be used to exploit generalizations based on accumulated experience  further reducing search

Marvin Minsky        quoted by  Blay Whitby        Reflections on Artificial Intelligence  p    
A century ago  we had essentially no way to start to explain how thinking works  Then psychologists like Sigmund Freud and Jean Piaget produced their theories about child development  Somewhat later  on the mechanical side  mathematicians like Kurt G del and Alan Turing began to reveal the hitherto unknown range of what machines could be made to do  These two streams of thought began to merge only in the     s  when Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts began to show how machines might be made to see  reason  and remember  Research in the modern science of Artificial Intelligence started only in the     s  stimulated by the invention of modern computers  This inspired a flood of new ideas about how machines could do what only minds had done previously

There is probably no more abused a term in the history of philosophy than  representation   and my use of this term differs both from its use in traditional philosophy and from its use in contemporary cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence     The sense of  representation  in question is meant to be entirely exhausted by the analogy with speech acts  the sense of  represent  in which a belief represents its conditions of satisfaction is the same sense in which a statement represents its conditions of satisfaction  To say that a belief is a representation is simply to say that it has a propositional content and a psychological mode

The AI does not hate you  nor does it love you  but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else

Many researchers  expect that the most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI  under anything remotely like the current circumstances  is that literally everyone on Earth will die  Not as in  maybe possibly some remote chance   but as in  that is the obvious thing that would happen   It s not that you can t  in principle  survive creating something much smarter than you  it s that it would require precision and preparation and new scientific insights  and probably not having AI systems composed of giant inscrutable arrays of fractional numbers

In a debate I hosted at Stanford in       the tech billionaire Peter Thiel used a memorable aphorism   AI is Communist  crypto is libertarian   TikTok validates the first half of that  In the late     s  during the Cultural Revolution  Chinese children denounced their parents for rightist deviance  In       when American teenagers posted videos of themselves berating their parents for racism  they did it on TikTok

If you ve got a computer that can play Go  a pretty complicated game with a lot of variations  then developing an algorithm that lets you maximize profits on the New York Stock Exchange is probably within sight  And if one person or organization got there first  they could bring down the stock market pretty quickly  or at least they could raise questions about the integrity of the financial markets   Then there could be an algorithm that said   Go penetrate the nuclear codes and figure out how to launch some missiles   If that s its only job  if it s self teaching and it s just a really effective algorithm  then you ve got problems  I think my directive to my national security team is  don t worry as much yet about machines taking over the world  Worry about the capacity of either nonstate actors or hostile actors to penetrate systems  and in that sense it is not conceptually different than a lot of the cybersecurity work we re doing  It just means that we re gonna have to be better  because those who might deploy these systems are going to be a lot better now    Barack Obama
Barack Obama  My general observation is that it has been seeping into our lives in all sorts of ways  and we just don t notice  and part of the reason is because the way we think about AI is colored by popular culture  There s a distinction  which is probably familiar to a lot of your readers  between generalized AI and specialized AI  In science fiction  what you hear about is generalized AI  right  Computers start getting smarter than we are and eventually conclude that we re not all that useful  and then either they re drugging us to keep us fat and happy or we re in the Matrix  My impression  based on talking to my top science advisers  is that we re still a reasonably long way away from that  It s worth thinking about because it stretches our imaginations and gets us thinking about the issues of choice and free will that actually do have some significant applications for specialized AI  which is about using algorithms and computers to figure out increasingly complex tasks  We ve been seeing specialized AI in every aspect of our lives  from medicine and transportation to how electricity is distributed  and it promises to create a vastly more productive and efficient economy  If properly harnessed  it can generate enormous prosperity and opportunity  But it also has some downsides that we re gonna have to figure out in terms of not eliminating jobs  It could increase inequality  It could suppress wages 
Joi Ito  This may upset some of my students at MIT  but one of my concerns is that it s been a predominately male gang of kids  mostly white  who are building the core computer science around AI  and they re more comfortable talking to computers than to human beings  A lot of them feel that if they could just make that science fiction  generalized AI  we wouldn t have to worry about all the messy stuff like politics and society  They think machines will just figure it all out for us 
Barack Obama  Let me start with what I think is the more immediate concern it s a solvable problem in this category of specialized AI  and we have to be mindful of it  If you ve got a computer that can play Go  a pretty complicated game with a lot of variations  then developing an algorithm that lets you maximize profits on the New York Stock Exchange is probably within sight  And if one person or organization got there first  they could bring down the stock market pretty quickly  or at least they could raise questions about the integrity of the financial markets   Then there could be an algorithm that said   Go penetrate the nuclear codes and figure out how to launch some missiles   If that s its only job  if it s self teaching and it s just a really effective algorithm  then you ve got problems  I think my directive to my national security team is  don t worry as much yet about machines taking over the world  Worry about the capacity of either nonstate actors or hostile actors to penetrate systems  and in that sense it is not conceptually different than a lot of the cybersecurity work we re doing  It just means that we re gonna have to be better  because those who might deploy these systems are going to be a lot better now
