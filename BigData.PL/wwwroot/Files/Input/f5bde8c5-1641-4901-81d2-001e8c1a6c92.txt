Mastering these basics will help us build a strong foundation for more advanced topics    What is MySQL and How does it differ from other relational databases MySQL is an open source relational database management system  RDBMS  that is widely used for managing structured data  It utilizes SQL  Structured Query Language  for querying and managing data  MySQL is known for its reliability  scalability  and performance  making it a popular choice for various applications   How to create a database in MySQL To create a database in MySQL  we can use the CREATE DATABASE statement followed by the name we want to give to our database  For example CREATE DATABASE mydatabase    Difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types CHARFixed length storage  If the string is shorter than the defined length  the remaining spaces are padded with blanks Suitable for storing fixed length data  e g   country codes  fixed length phone numbers  CHAR may be faster for small  fixed length strings VARCHARVariable length storage  Only the exact number of characters is stored  saving space Suitable for storing strings where the length varies  like names or descriptions VARCHAR uses less space and is ideal for large strings of varying length    Explain the differences between SQL and MySQL SQLMySQLIt is a structured query language that manages the relational database management system It is a relational database management system that uses SQL It is not an open source language  MySQL is an open source platform  It allows access to anyone SQL supports XML and user defined functions It doesn t support XML and any user defined functionsSQL can be implemented in various RDBMS such as PostgreSQL  SQLite  Microsoft SQL Server  and others MySQL is a specific implementation of an RDBMS that uses SQL for querying and managing databases SQL itself is not a product and doesn t have a license  It s a standard language MySQL is open source and available under the GNU General Public License  GPL     What is the MySQL server s default port The default port for MySQL server is       This is the port number used by MySQL to communicate with clients and other services by default  unless it is configured to use a different port in the MySQL configuration file  my cnf or my ini     How can we learn batch mode in MySQL Batch mode in MySQL is used to execute a series of SQL queries from a file

batch file sql   How many different tables are present in MySQL There are several storage engines in MySQL  and the table types depend on which storage engine is used  The common storage engines are InnoDB  default in MySQL for transactional data MyISAM  older  non transactional storage engine MEMORY  stores data in memory CSV  stores data in CSV files ARCHIVE  used for storing large amounts of data  read only    What are the differences between CHAR and VARCHAR data types in MySQL Storage and retrieval have been different for CHAR and VARCHAR  Column length is fixed in CHAR but VARCHAR length is variable CHAR is faster than VARCHAR CHAR datatype can hold a maximum of     characters while VARCHAR can store up to      characters    What is Difference between CHAR LENGTH and LENGTH LENGTH  Returns the byte count of a string  For multi byte characters  it counts the total number of bytes used CHAR LENGTH  Returns the character count of a string  counting each character regardless of byte size Example SELECT LENGTH  Hello             Returns      byte per character in ASCII SELECT CHAR LENGTH  Hello        Returns      characters     What do you understand by   and   in the like statement In the LIKE statement  the   and   symbols are used for pattern matching    Represents zero or more characters  It matches any sequence of characters  including an empty sequence    Represents exactly one character  It matches any single character Example SELECT   FROM Employees WHERE Name LIKE  J n         Matches names starting with  J  and ending with  n   like  John  or  Jack SELECT   FROM Employees WHERE Name LIKE  J n         Matches names starting with  J  and having exactly one character after  J   like  Jon     How many index columns can be created in a table There are    indexed columns can be created in a table     What are string types available for columns There are six string types available for the column SETBLOBTEXTENUMCHARVARCHAR    Explain the main

done in binary format  Types  TINYBLOB  BLOB  MEDIUMBLOB  LONGBLOBTEXT  Used to store large amounts of text data  Unlike BLOB  TEXT data is case insensitive and sorted lexicographically Types  TINYTEXT  TEXT  MEDIUMTEXT  LONGTEXT    Explain the difference between having and where clause in MySQL WHERE statement is used to filter rows but HAVING statement is used to filter groups GROUP BY is not used with WHERE  HAVING clause is used with GROUP BY     Explain REGEXP REGEXP  Regular Expression  is used in MySQL to perform pattern matching with string values  It allows you to use regular expressions for string searches within a query  The pattern can match anywhere in the string and is case insensitive by default Syntax SELECT   FROM table name WHERE column name REGEXP  pattern      How can we add a column in MySQL A column is a series of table cells that store a value for table s each row  we can add column by using ALTER TABLE statement ALTER TABLE tab nameADD COLUMN col name

What is join  Tell different join in MySQL JOINs in MySQL are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column  The most common types of joins are    INNER JOIN  Returns records that have matching values in both tables SELECT   FROM table INNER JOIN table  ON table  id   table  id    LEFT JOIN  or LEFT OUTER JOIN   Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table  If there s no match  NULL values are returned for the right table SELECT   FROM table LEFT JOIN table  ON table  id   table  id    RIGHT JOIN  or RIGHT OUTER JOIN   Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table  If there s no match  NULL values are returned for the left table SELECT   FROM table RIGHT JOIN table  ON table  id   table  id

permitted in the heap table comparison operator like     lt   gt      gt    lt  can be used only Heap table didn t support the AUTO INCREMENT command Indexes should be NOT NULL in the heap table     What is the main difference between the primary key and the candidate key The primary key uniquely identified each row of a table  only one primary key is available for a table  A primary is also a candidate key Candidate key that can be used for all foreign key references     What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands in MySQL DELETE Command is used to delete rows from the

table  it is created by combining one or more tables  The difference of a view and a table is that views are definition that build on other tables  If the underlying table changes  the View will also
