In mathematics  a combinatorial explosion is the rapid growth of the complexity of a problem due to the way its combinatorics depends on input  constraints and bounds  Combinatorial explosion is sometimes used to justify the intractability of certain problems                        Examples of such problems include certain mathematical functions  the analysis of some puzzles and games  and some pathological examples which can be modelled as the Ackermann function 


Examples edit 
Latin squares edit 
Main article  Latin square
A Latin square of order n is an n               n array with entries from a set of n elements with the property that each element of the set occurs exactly once in each row and each column of the array  An example of a Latin square of order three is given by 




 
 
 


 
 
 


 
 
 

A common example of a Latin square would be a completed Sudoku puzzle             A Latin square is a combinatorial object  as opposed to an algebraic object  since only the arrangement of entries matters and not what the entries actually are  The number of Latin squares as a function of the order  independent of the set from which the entries are drawn   sequence A       in the OEIS  provides an example of combinatorial explosion as illustrated by the following table

Sudoku edit 
Main article  Mathematics of Sudoku
A combinatorial explosion can also occur in some puzzles played on a grid  such as Sudoku             A Sudoku is a type of Latin square with the additional property that each element occurs exactly once in sub sections of size        n                     n  called boxes   Combinatorial explosion occurs as n increases  creating limits to the properties of Sudokus that can be constructed  analyzed  and solved  as illustrated in the following table

 n     is the commonly played                   Sudoku  The puzzle does not include grids where        n is irrational  

Games edit 
One example in a game where combinatorial complexity leads to a solvability limit is in solving chess  a game with    squares and    pieces   Chess is not a solved game  In      all chess game endings with six pieces or fewer were solved  showing the result of each position if played perfectly  It took ten more years to complete the tablebase with one more chess piece added  thus completing a   piece tablebase  Adding one more piece to a chess ending  thus making an   piece tablebase  is considered intractable due to the added combinatorial complexity                       
Furthermore  the prospect of solving larger chess like games becomes more difficult as the board size is increased  such as in large chess variants  and infinite chess            

Computing edit 
Combinatorial explosion can occur in computing environments in a way analogous to communications and multi dimensional space  Imagine a simple system with only one variable  a boolean called A  The system has two possible states  A   true or A   false  Adding another boolean variable B will give the system four possible states  A   true and B   true  A   true and B   false  A   false and B   true  A   false and B   false  A system with n booleans has  n possible states  while a system of n variables each with Z allowed values  rather than just the    true and false  of booleans  will have Zn possible states 
The possible states can be thought of as the leaf nodes of a tree of height n  where each node has Z children  This rapid increase of leaf nodes can be useful in areas like searching  since many results can be accessed without having to descend very far  It can also be a hindrance when manipulating such structures 
A class hierarchy in an object oriented language can be thought of as a tree  with different types of object inheriting from their parents  If different classes need to be combined  such as in a comparison  like A       lt       B  then the number of possible combinations which may occur explodes  If each type of comparison needs to be programmed then this soon becomes intractable for even small numbers of classes  Multiple inheritance can solve this  by allowing subclasses to have multiple parents  and thus a few parent classes can be considered rather than every child  without disrupting any existing hierarchy 
An example is a taxonomy where different vegetables inherit from their ancestor species  Attempting to compare the tastiness of each vegetable with the others becomes intractable since the hierarchy only contains information about genetics and makes no mention of tastiness  However  instead of having to write comparisons for carrot carrot  carrot potato  carrot sprout  potato potato  potato sprout  sprout sprout  they can all multiply inherit from a separate class of tasty whilst keeping their current ancestor based hierarchy  then all of the above can be implemented with only a tasty tasty comparison 

Arithmetic edit 
Suppose we take the factorial of n 


  
    
      
        n
         
         
        n
          x  c  
         
        n
          x     
         
         
          x  c  
          x     
          x  c  
         
          x  c  
         
      
    
      displaystyle n  n cdot  n    cdot  ldots  cdot   cdot   
  

Then                         and           However  we quickly get to extremely large numbers  even for relatively small n   For example                           a number so large that it cannot be displayed on most calculators  and vastly larger than the estimated number of fundamental particles in the observable universe            

Communication edit 


Using separate lines of communication  four organizations require six channels

Using an intermediary  only one channel per organization is required

In administration and computing  a combinatorial explosion is the rapidly accelerating increase in communication lines as organizations are added in a process    This growth is often casually described as  exponential  but is actually polynomial  
If two organizations need to communicate about a particular topic  it may be easiest to communicate directly in an ad hoc manner       only one channel of communication is required   However  if a third organization is added  three separate channels are required   Adding a fourth organization requires six channels  five  ten  six  fifteen  etc 
In general  it will take

  
    
      
        l
         
        
          
            
              n
               
              n
                x     
               
               
            
             
          
        
         
        
          
            
               
            
            
              n
               
            
            
               
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle l   frac  n n          n  choose    
  

communication lines for n organizations  which is just the number of   combinations of n elements  see also Binomial coefficient              
The alternative approach is to realize when this communication will not be a one off requirement  and produce a generic or intermediate way of passing information   The drawback is that this requires more work for the first pair  since each must convert its internal approach to the common one  rather than the superficially easier approach of just understanding the other
