System that takes physical patterns and combines them into structures and manipulates them
A physical symbol system  also called a formal system  takes physical patterns  symbols   combining them into structures  expressions  and manipulating them  using processes  to produce new expressions 
The physical symbol system hypothesis  PSSH  is a position in the philosophy of artificial intelligence formulated by Allen Newell and Herbert A  Simon  They wrote 

 A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action             
This claim implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation  because a symbol system is necessary for intelligence  and that machines can be intelligent  because a symbol system is sufficient for intelligence             
The idea has philosophical roots in Thomas Hobbes  who claimed reasoning was  nothing more than reckoning    Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz  who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas    David Hume  who thought perception could be reduced to  atomic impressions   and even Immanuel Kant  who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules              The latest version is called the computational theory of mind  associated with philosophers Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor            


Examples edit 
Examples of physical symbol systems include 

Formal logic  the symbols are words like  and    or    not    for all x  and so on  The expressions are statements in formal logic which can be true or false   The processes are the rules of logical deduction 
Algebra  the symbols are            x    y                  etc  The expressions are equations  The processes are the rules of algebra  that allow one to manipulate a mathematical expression and retain its truth 
Chess  the symbols are the pieces  the processes are the legal chess moves  the expressions are the positions of all the pieces on the board 
A computer running a program  the symbols and expressions are data structures  the process is the program that changes the data structures 
The physical symbol system hypothesis claims that both of the following are also examples of physical symbol systems 

Intelligent human thought  the symbols are encoded in our brains  The expressions are thoughts  The processes are the mental operations of thinking 
English language  the symbols are words  The expressions are sentences  The processes are the mental operations that enable speaking  writing or reading 
Evidence for the hypothesis edit 
Two lines of evidence suggested to Allen Newell and Herbert A  Simon that  symbol manipulation  was the essence of both human and machine intelligence  psychological experiments on human beings and the development of artificial intelligence programs 

Psychological experiments and computer models edit 
See also  Cognitive science and computational cognition
Newell and Simon carried out psychological experiments that showed that  for difficult problems in logic  planning  or any kind of  puzzle solving   people carefully proceeded step by step  considering several different possible ways forward  selected the most promising one  backing up when the possibility hit a dead end  Each possible solution was visualized with symbols  such as words  numbers or diagrams  This was  symbol manipulation     the people were iteratively exploring a formal system looking for a matching pattern that solved the puzzle                                   Newell and Simon were able to simulate the step by step problem solving skills of people with computer programs  they created programs that used the same algorithms as people and were able to solve the same problems  
This type of research  using both experimental psychology and computer models  was called  cognitive simulation  by Hubert Dreyfus             Their work was profoundly influential  it contributed to the cognitive revolution of the     s  in addition to the founding of the fields of cognitive science and cognitivism in psychology  
This line of research suggested that human problem solving consisted primarily of the manipulation of high level symbols 

Artificial intelligence programs in the     s and   s edit 
See also  Symbolic AI
In the early decades of AI research there were many programs that used high level symbol processing  These programs were very successful  demonstrating skills that many people at the time had assumed were impossible for machines  such as solving algebra word problems  STUDENT   proving theorems in logic  Logic Theorist   learning to play competitive checkers  Arthur Samuel s checkers   and communicating in natural language  ELIZA  SHRDLU                                      
The success of these programs suggested that symbol processing systems could simulate any intelligent action 

Clarifications edit 
The physical symbol systems hypothesis becomes trivial  incoherent or irrelevant unless we recognize three distinctions  between  digitized signals  and  symbols   between  narrow  AI and general intelligence  and between consciousness and intelligent behavior 

Semantic symbols vs  dynamic signals edit 
The physical symbol system hypothesis is only interesting if we restrict the  symbols  to things that have a recognizable meaning or denotation and can be composed with other symbols to create more complex symbols  like   lt dog gt  and  lt tail gt   It doesn t apply to the simple  s and  s in the memory of a digital computer or the stream of  s and  s passing through the perceptual apparatus of a robot  It also doesn t apply to matrixes of unidentified numbers  such as those used in neural networks or support vector machines  These may technically be symbols  but it is not always possible to determine exactly what the symbols are standing for  This is not what Newell and Simon had in mind  and the argument becomes trivial if we include them 
David Touretzky and Dean Pomerleau consider what would follow if we interpret the  symbols  in the PSSH to be binary digits of digital hardware  In this version of the hypothesis  no distinction is being made between  symbols  and  signals   Here the physical symbol system hypothesis asserts merely that intelligence can be digitized  This is a weaker claim  Indeed  Touretzky and Pomerleau write that if symbols and signals are the same thing  then    s ufficiency is a given  unless one is a dualist or some other sort of mystic  because physical symbol systems are Turing universal               The widely accepted Church       Turing thesis holds that any Turing universal system can simulate any conceivable process that can be digitized  given enough time and memory  Since any digital computer is Turing universal  any digital computer can  in theory  simulate anything that can be digitized to a sufficient level of precision  including the behavior of intelligent organisms  The necessary condition of the physical symbol systems hypothesis can likewise be finessed  since we are willing to accept almost any signal as a form of  symbol  and all intelligent biological systems have signal pathways             
The same issue applies to the unidentified numbers that appear in the matrixes of a neural network or a support vector machine  These programs are using the same mathematics as a digitial simulation of a dynamical system  and is better understood as  dynamic system  than a  physical symbol system   Nils Nilsson wrote   any physical process can be simulated to any desired degree of accuracy on a symbol manipulating computer  but an account of such a simulation in terms of symbols  instead of signals  can be unmanageably cumbersome              

General intelligence vs   narrow  intelligence edit 
The PSSH refers to  general intelligent action     that is  to every activity that we would consider  intelligent   Thus it is the claim that artificial general intelligence can be achieved using only symbolic methods  It does not refer to  narrow  applications   That is  applications that are intended only to solve exactly one problem    which includes almost all AI systems currently in use  
Artificial intelligence research has succeeded in developing many programs that are capable of intelligently solving particular problems  However  AI research has so far not been able to produce a system with artificial general intelligence    the ability to solve a variety of novel problems  as humans do  
Thus  the criticism of the PSSH refers to the limits of AI in the future  and does not apply to any current research or programs 
Some claim that large language models are capable of  general intelligent action   however this is arguable      clarification needed     

Consciousness vs  intelligent action edit 
The PSSH refers to  intelligent action     that is  the behavior of the machine    it does not refer to the  mental states    mind    consciousness   or the  experiences  of the machine   Consciousness   as far as neurology can determine  is not something that can deduced from the behavior of an agent  it is always possible that the machine is simulating the experience of consciousness  without actually experiencing it  similar to the way a perfectly written fictional character might simulate a person with consciousness  
Thus  the PSSH is not relevant to positions which refer to  mind  or  consciousness   such as John Searle s Strong AI hypothesis 


The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds                         
Evidence against the hypothesis edit 
Nils Nilsson has identified four main  themes  or grounds in which the physical symbol system hypothesis has been attacked            

The  erroneous claim that the  physical symbol system hypothesis  lacks symbol grounding  which is presumed to be a requirement for general intelligent action 
The common belief that AI requires non symbolic processing  that which can be supplied by a connectionist architecture for instance  
The common statement that the brain is simply not a computer and that  computation as it is currently understood  does not provide an appropriate model for intelligence  
And last of all that it is also believed in by some that the brain is essentially mindless  most of what takes place are chemical reactions and that human intelligent behaviour is analogous to the intelligent behaviour displayed for example by ant colonies 
Evidence the brain does not always use symbols edit 
If the human brain does not use symbolic reasoning to create intelligent behavior  then the necessary side of the hypothesis is false  and human intelligence is the counter example  

Dreyfus edit 
Main article  Dreyfus  critique of AI
Hubert Dreyfus attacked the necessary condition of the physical symbol system hypothesis  calling it  the psychological assumption  and defining it thus 

The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules             
Dreyfus refuted this by showing that human intelligence and expertise depended primarily on unconscious instincts rather than conscious symbolic manipulation  Experts solve problems quickly by using their intuitions  rather than step by step trial and error searches  Dreyfus argued that these unconscious skills would never be captured in formal rules

George Lakoff  Mark Turner and others have argued that our abstract skills in areas such as mathematics  ethics and philosophy depend on unconscious skills that derive from the body  and that conscious symbol manipulation is only a small part of our intelligence      citation needed     

Evidence that symbolic AI can t efficiently generate intelligence for all problems edit 
It is impossible to prove that symbolic AI will never produce general intelligence  but if we can not find an efficient way to solve particular problems with symbolic AI  this is evidence that the sufficient side of the PSSH is unlikely to be true

Evidence that sub symbolic or neurosymbolic AI programs can generate intelligence edit 
If sub symbolic AI programs  such as deep learning  can intelligently solve problems  then this is evidence that the necessary side of the PSSH is false  
If hybrid approaches that combine symbolic AI with other approaches can efficiently solve a wider range of problems than either technique alone  this is evidence that the necessary side is true and the sufficiency side is false  

Brooks edit 
Main article  Artificial intelligence  situated approach
Rodney Brooks of MIT was able to build robots that had superior ability to move and survive without the use of symbolic reasoning at all  Brooks  and others  such as Hans Moravec  discovered that our most basic skills of motion  survival  perception  balance and so on did not seem to require high level symbols at all  that in fact  the use of high level symbols was more complicated and less successful 
In a      paper Elephants Don t Play Chess  Rodney Brooks took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis  arguing that symbols are not always necessary since  the world is its own best model  It is always exactly up to date  It always has every detail there is to be known  The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough              

Connectionism and deep learning edit 
In      AlexNet  a deep learning network  outperformed all other programs in classifying images on ImageNet by a substantial margin  In the years since  deep learning has proved to be much more successful in many domains than symbolic AI      citation needed
