     radio quiz show Whiz Kids on WHN Radio in New York
Game shows began to appear on radio and television in the late     s  The first television game show  Spelling Bee  as well as the first radio game show  Information Please  were both broadcast in       the first major success in the game show genre was Dr  I Q   a radio quiz show that began in      

Note For Note  a New Zealand game show from around     
Truth or Consequences was the first game show to air on commercially licensed television  CBS Television Quiz followed shortly thereafter as the first to be regularly scheduled  The first episode of each aired in      as an experimental broadcast  Over the course of the     s  as television began to pervade the popular culture  game shows quickly became a fixture  Daytime game shows would be played for lower stakes to target stay at home housewives  Higher stakes programs would air in prime time   One particular exception in this era was You Bet Your Life  ostensibly a game show  but the game show concept was largely a framework for a talk show moderated by its host  Groucho Marx   During the late     s  high stakes games such as Twenty One and The         Question began a rapid rise in popularity  However  the rise of quiz shows proved to be short lived  In       many of the higher stakes game shows were exposed as being either biased or outright scripted in the     s quiz show scandals and ratings declines led to most of the primetime games being canceled 
An early variant of the game show  the panel show  survived the quiz show scandals  On shows like What s My Line   I ve Got a Secret  and To Tell the Truth  panels of celebrities would interview a guest in an effort to determine some fact about them  in others  celebrities would answer questions  Panel games had success in primetime until the late     s  when they were collectively dropped from television because of their perceived low budget nature  Panel games made a comeback in American daytime television  where the lower budgets were tolerated  in the     s through comedy driven shows such as Match Game and Hollywood Squares  In the UK  commercial demographic pressures were not as prominent  and restrictions on game shows made in the wake of the scandals limited the style of games that could be played and the amount of money that could be awarded  Panel shows there were kept in primetime and have continued to thrive  they have transformed into showcases for the nation s top stand up comedians on shows such as Have I Got News for You  Would I Lie to You   Mock the Week  QI  and   Out of    Cats  all of which put a heavy emphasis on comedy  leaving the points as mere formalities  The focus on quick witted comedians has resulted in strong ratings  which  combined with low costs of production  have only spurred growth in the UK panel show phenomenon

Game shows remained a fixture of American daytime television through the     s after the quiz show scandals  Lower stakes games made a slight comeback in daytime in the early     s  examples include Jeopardy  which began in      and the original version of The Match Game first aired in       Let s Make a Deal began in      and the     s also marked the debut of Hollywood Squares  Password  The Dating Game  and The Newlywed Game 
Though CBS gave up on daytime game shows in       the other networks did not follow suit  Color television was introduced to the game show genre in the late     s on all three networks  The     s saw a renaissance of the game show as new games and massive upgrades to existing games made debuts on the major networks  The New Price Is Right  an update of the     s era game show The Price Is Right  debuted in      and marked CBS s return to the game show format in its rural purge  The Match Game became  Big Money  Match Game     which proved popular enough to prompt a spin off  Family Feud  on ABC in       The         Pyramid and its numerous higher stakes derivatives also debuted in       while the     s also saw the return of formerly disgraced producer and game show host Jack Barry  who debuted The Joker s Wild and a clean version of the previously rigged Tic Tac Dough in the     s  Wheel of Fortune debuted on NBC in       The Prime Time Access Rule  which took effect in       barred networks from broadcasting in the     p m  time slot immediately preceding prime time  opening up time slots for syndicated programming  Most of the syndicated programs were  nighttime  adaptations of network daytime game shows  These game shows originally aired once a week  but by the late     s and early     s most of the games had transitioned to five days a week  Many people were amazed at this and in the late     s  gameshows were aired   times a week  twice a day

Game shows were the lowest priority of television networks and were rotated out every thirteen weeks if unsuccessful  Most tapes were wiped until the early     s  Over the course of the     s and early     s  as fewer new hits  e g  Press Your Luck  Sale of the Century  and Card Sharks  were produced  game shows lost their permanent place in the daytime lineup  ABC transitioned out of the daytime game show format in the mid     s  briefly returning to the format for one season in      with a Match Game revival   NBC s game block also lasted until       but the network attempted to bring them back in      before cancelling its game show block again in       CBS phased out most of its game shows  except for The Price Is Right  by       To the benefit of the genre  the moves of Wheel of Fortune and a modernized revival of Jeopardy  to syndication in      and       respectively  was and remains highly successful  the two are  to this day  fixtures in the prime time  access period  
Cable television also allowed for the debut of game shows such as Supermarket Sweep and Debt  Lifetime   Trivial Pursuit and Family Challenge  Family Channel   and Double Dare  Nickelodeon   It also opened up a previously underdeveloped market for game show reruns  General interest networks such as CBN Cable Network  forerunner to Freeform  and USA Network had popular blocks for game show reruns from the mid     s to the mid    s before that niche market was overtaken by Game Show Network in      
In the United Kingdom  game shows have had a more steady and permanent place in the television lineup and never lost popularity in the     s as they did in the United States  due in part to the fact that game shows were highly regulated by the Independent Broadcasting Authority in the     s and that those restrictions were lifted in the     s  allowing for higher stakes games to be played 

The      British game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire  went on to be licensed internationally  Salvadoran version pictured  
After the popularity of game shows hit a nadir in the mid     s United States  at which point The Price Is Right was the only game show still on daytime network television and numerous game shows designed for cable television were canceled   the British game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire  began distribution around the globe  Upon the show s American debut in       it was a hit and became a regular part of ABC s primetime lineup until       that show would eventually air in syndication for seventeen years afterward  Several shorter lived high stakes games were attempted around the time of the millennium  both in the United States and the United Kingdom  such as Winning Lines  The Chair  Greed  Paranoia  and Shafted  leading to some dubbing this period as  The Million Dollar Game Show Craze   The boom quickly went bust  as by July       almost all of the imitator million dollar shows were canceled  one of those exceptions was Winning Lines  which continued to air in the United Kingdom until      even though it was canceled in the United States in early        these higher stakes contests nevertheless opened the door to reality television contests such as Survivor and Big Brother  in which contestants win large sums of money for outlasting their peers in a given environment  Several game shows returned to daytime in syndication during this time as well  such as Family Feud  Hollywood Squares  and Millionaire 

    s present edit 
Wheel of Fortune  Jeopardy  and Family Feud have continued in syndication  To keep pace with the prime time quiz shows  Jeopardy  doubled its question values in      and lifted its winnings limit in       which one year later allowed Ken Jennings to become the show s first multi million dollar winner  it has also increased the stakes of its tournaments and put a larger focus on contestants with strong personalities  The show has since produced four more millionaires  tournament winner Brad Rutter and recent champions James Holzhauer  Matt Amodio  and Amy Schneider  Family Feud revived in popularity with a change in tone under host Steve Harvey to include more ribaldry 
In       actress and comedienne Kim Coles became the first black woman to host a prime time game show  Pay It Off 
The rise of digital television in the United States opened up a large market for rerun programs  Buzzr was established by Fremantle  owners of numerous classic U S  game shows  as a broadcast outlet for its archived holdings in June       There was also a rise of live game shows at festivals and public venues  where the general audience could participate in the show  such as the science inspired Geek Out Game Show or the Yuck Show 
Since the early     s  several game shows were conducted in a tournament format  examples included History IQ  Grand Slam  PokerFace  which never aired in North America   Duel  The Million Second Quiz      Questions  The American Bible Challenge  and Mental Samurai  Most game shows conducted in this manner only lasted for one season 
A boom in prime time revivals of classic daytime game shows began to emerge in the mid     s  In       ABC packaged the existing Celebrity Family Feud  which had returned in       with new versions of To Tell the Truth  The          Pyramid  and Match Game in       new versions of Press Your Luck and Card Sharks would follow in       TBS launched a cannabis themed revival of The Joker s Wild  hosted by Snoop Dogg  in October       This is in addition to a number of original game concepts that appeared near the same time  including Awake  Deal or No Deal  which originally aired in        Child Support  Hollywood Game Night    vs       Minute to Win It  which originally aired in        The Wall  and a string of music themed games such as Don t Forget the Lyrics   The Singing Bee  and Beat Shazam  The game show format staged a comeback on daytime television in the     s with new formats such as Flip Side and The Perfect Line  both syndicated through CBS s syndication wing            

International issues edit 
The popularity of game shows in the United States was closely paralleled around the world  Reg Grundy Organisation  for instance  would buy the international rights for American game shows and reproduce them in other countries  especially in Grundy s native Australia  Dutch producer Endemol  later purchased by American companies Disney and Apollo Global Management  then resold to French company Banijay  has created and released numerous game shows and reality television formats popular around the world  Most game show formats that are popular in one country are franchised to others 
Game shows have had an inconsistent place in television in Canada  with most homegrown game shows there being made for the French speaking Quebec market and the majority of English language game shows in the country being rebroadcast from  or made with the express intent of export to  the United States  There have been exceptions to this  see  for instance  the long running Definition   Unlike reality television franchises  international game show franchises generally only see Canadian adaptations in a series of specials  based heavily on the American versions but usually with a Canadian host to allow for Canadian content credits  one of those exceptions was Le Banquier  a Quebec French language version of Deal or No Deal which aired on TVA from      to        The smaller markets and lower revenue opportunities for Canadian shows in general also affect game shows there  with Canadian games  especially Quebecois ones  often having very low budgets for prizes  unless the series is made for export  Canadian contestants are generally allowed to participate on American game shows  and there have been at least three Canadian game show hosts   Howie Mandel  Monty Hall and Alex Trebek   who have gone on to long careers hosting American series  while Jim Perry  an American host  was prominent as a host of Canadian shows 
American game shows have a tendency to hire stronger contestants than their British or Australian counterparts  Many of the most successful game show contestants in America would likely never be cast in a British or Australian game show for fear of having them dominate the game  according to Mark Labbett  who appeared in all three countries on the game show The Chase            

Japanese game show edit

The Japanese game show is a distinct format  borrowing heavily from variety formats  physical stunts and athletic competitions  The Japanese style has been adapted overseas  and at one point was parodied with an American reality competition  I Survived a Japanese Game Show  which used a fake Japanese game show as its central conceit  

Prizes edit

Many of the prizes awarded on game shows are provided through product placement  but in some cases they are provided by private organizations or purchased at either the full price or at a discount by the show  There is the widespread use of  promotional consideration   in which a game show receives a subsidy from an advertiser in return for awarding that manufacturer s product as a prize or consolation prize  Some products supplied by manufacturers may not be intended to be awarded and are instead just used as part of the gameplay such as the low priced items used in several The Price is Right pricing games  Although in this show the smaller items  sometimes even in the single digits of dollars  are awarded as well when the price is correctly guessed  even when a contestant loses the major prize they were playing for 
For high stakes games  a network may purchase prize indemnity insurance to avoid paying the cost of a rare but expensive prize out of pocket  If the said prize is won too often  the insurance company may refuse to insure a show  this was a factor in the discontinuation of The Price Is Right            Spectacular series of prime time specials  In April       three of the contestants on The Price Is Right            Spectacular won the top prize in a five episode span after fifteen episodes without a winner  due in large part to a change in the rules  The insurance companies had made it extremely difficult to get further insurance for the remaining episodes  A network or syndicator may also opt to distribute large cash prizes in the form of an annuity  spreading the cost of the prize out over several years or decades 
From about      through the rest of the   th century  American networks placed restrictions on the amount of money that could be given away on a game show  in an effort to avoid a repeat of the scandals of the     s  This usually took the form of an earnings cap that forced a player to retire once they had won a certain amount of money or a limit on how many episodes  usually five  on which a player could appear on a show  The introduction of syndicated games  particularly in the     s  eventually allowed for more valuable prizes and extended runs on a particular show  British television was under even stricter regulations on prizes until the     s  seriously restricting the value of prizes that could be given and disallowing games of chance to have an influence on the results of the game   Thus  the British version of The Price Is Right at first did not include the American version s  Showcase Showdown   in which contestants spun a large wheel to determine who would advance to the Showcase bonus round   In Canada  prizes were limited not by bureaucracy but necessity  as the much smaller population limited the audience of shows marketed toward that country  The lifting of these restrictions in the     s was a major factor in the explosion of high stakes game shows in the later part of that decade in both the U S  and Britain and  subsequently  around the world 

Bonus round edit 
A bonus round  also known as a bonus game or an end game  usually follows a main game as a bonus to the winner of that game  In the bonus round  the stakes are higher and the game is considered to be tougher            
The game play of a bonus round usually varies from the standard game play of the front game  and there are often borrowed or related elements of the main game in the bonus round to ensure the entire show has a unified premise  Though some end games are referred to as  bonus rounds   many are not specifically referred to as such in games but fit the same general role  There is no one formula for the format of a bonus round 
Until the     s  most game shows did not offer a bonus round  In traditional two player formats  the winner   if a game show s rules provided for this   became the champion and simply played a new challenger either on the next show or after the commercial break            
One of the earliest forms of bonus rounds was the Jackpot Round of the original series Beat the Clock  After two rounds of performing stunts  the wife of the contestant couple would perform at a jackpot board for a prize  The contestant was shown a famous quotation or common phrase  and the words were scrambled  To win the announced bonus  the contestant had to unscramble the words within    seconds  The contestant received a consolation gift worth over      if she was unsuccessful 
Another early bonus round ended each episode of You Bet Your Life with the team who won the most money answering one final question for a jackpot which started at        and increased      each week until won 
Another early example was the Lightning Round on the word game Password  starting in       The contestant who won the front game played a quick fire series of passwords within    seconds  netting     per correctly guessed word  for a maximum bonus prize of                            
The bonus round came about after game show producer Mark Goodson was first presented Password  contending that it was not enough to merely guess passwords during the show   We needed something more  and that s how the Lightning Round was invited   said Howard Felsher  who produced Password and Family Feud   From that point on every game show had to have an end round  You d bring a show to a network  and they d say   What s the endgame   as if they had thought of it themselves             
The  Super Match   the game of Match Game  served as the impetus for Family Feud
