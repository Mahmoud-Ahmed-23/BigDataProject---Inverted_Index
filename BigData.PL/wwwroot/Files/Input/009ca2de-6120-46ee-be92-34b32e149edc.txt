Judea Pearl  Hebrew             born September          is an Israeli American computer scientist and philosopher  best known for championing the probabilistic approach to artificial intelligence and the development of Bayesian networks  see the article on belief propagation   He is also credited for developing a theory of causal and counterfactual inference based on structural models  see article on causality   In       the Association for Computing Machinery  ACM  awarded Pearl with the Turing Award  the highest distinction in computer science   for fundamental contributions to artificial intelligence through the development of a calculus for probabilistic and causal reasoning                                               He is the author of several books  including the technical Causality  Models  Reasoning and Inference  and The Book of Why  a book on causality aimed at the general public 
Judea Pearl is the father of journalist Daniel Pearl  who was kidnapped and murdered by terrorists in Pakistan connected with Al Qaeda and the International Islamic Front in      for his American and Jewish heritage

Pearl is currently a professor of computer science and statistics and director of the Cognitive Systems Laboratory at UCLA  He and his wife  Ruth  had three children  In addition  as of          update       he is a member of the International Advisory Board of NGO Monitor             
Former Israeli Chief Rabbi  Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau  partnered with Judea Pearl in the documentary With My Whole Broken Heart

Research edit 
Judea Pearl is credited for  laying the foundations of modern artificial intelligence  so computer systems can process  uncertainty and relate causes to effects  
           
He is one of the pioneers of Bayesian networks and the probabilistic approach to artificial intelligence  and one of the first to mathematize causal modeling in the empirical sciences  His work is also intended as a high level cognitive model  He is interested in the philosophy of science  knowledge representation  nonstandard logics  and learning  Pearl is described as  one of the giants in the field of artificial intelligence  by UCLA computer science professor Richard E  Korf              His work on causality has  revolutionized the understanding of causality in statistics  psychology  medicine and the social sciences  according to the Association for Computing Machinery
