Robotic sensing is a subarea of robotics science intended to provide sensing capabilities to robots  Robotic sensing provides robots with the ability to sense their environments and is typically used as feedback to enable robots to adjust their behavior based on sensed input  Robot sensing includes the ability to see                                   touch                                   hear            and move                                   and associated algorithms to process and make use of environmental feedback and sensory data  Robot sensing is important in applications such as vehicular automation  robotic prosthetics  and for industrial  medical  entertainment and educational robots 


Vision edit 
Main articles  Computer vision and Machine vision
Method edit 
Visual sensing systems can be based on a variety of technologies and methods including the use of camera  sonar  laser and radio frequency identification  RFID             technology  All four methods aim for three procedures sensation  estimation  and matching 

Image processing edit 
Image quality is important in applications that require excellent robotic vision  Algorithms based on wavelet transform that are used for fusing images of different spectra and different foci result in improved image quality             Robots can gather more accurate information from the resulting improved image 

Usage edit 
Visual sensors help robots to identify the surrounding environment and take appropriate action             Robots analyze the image of the immediate environment based on data input from the visual sensor  The result is compared to the ideal  intermediate or end image  so that appropriate movement or action can be determined to reach the intermediate or final goal

Robot skin edit 
This section is an excerpt from Electronic skin  edit 
Electronic skin refers to flexible  stretchable and self healing electronics that are able to mimic functionalities of human or animal skin                          The broad class of materials often contain sensing abilities that are intended to reproduce the capabilities of human skin to respond to environmental factors such as changes in heat and pressure                                                 
Advances in electronic skin research focuses on designing materials that are stretchy  robust  and flexible  Research in the individual fields of flexible electronics and tactile sensing has progressed greatly  however  electronic skin design attempts to bring together advances in many areas of materials research without sacrificing individual benefits from each field              The successful combination of flexible and stretchable mechanical properties with sensors and the ability to self heal would open the door to many possible applications including soft robotics  prosthetics  artificial intelligence and health monitoring                                                 

Recent advances in the field of electronic skin have focused on incorporating green materials ideals and environmental awareness into the design process  As one of the main challenges facing electronic skin development is the ability of the material to withstand mechanical strain and maintain sensing ability or electronic properties  recyclability and self healing properties are especially critical in the future design of new electronic skins             
Types and examples edit 
Examples of the current state of progress in the field of robot skins as of mid      are a robotic finger covered in a type of manufactured living human skin                          an electronic skin giving biological skin like haptic sensations and touch pain sensitivity to a robotic hand                          a system of an electronic skin and a human machine interface that can enable remote sensed tactile perception  and wearable or robotic sensing of many hazardous substances and pathogens                          and a  multilayer tactile sensor hydrogel based robot skin                         

Tactile discrimination edit 
Further information  Tactile sensor
This section is an excerpt from Tactile discrimination   Robotic tactile discrimination  edit 
Early robotic prosthetic hand  made in       On open public display at the main shopping mall in Belgrade 
As robots and prosthetic limbs become more complex the need for sensors capable of detecting touch with high tactile acuity becomes more and more necessary  There are many types of tactile sensors used for different tasks              There are three types of tactile sensors  The first  single point sensors  can be compared to a single cell  or whiskers  and can detect very local stimuli  The second type of sensor is a high spatial resolution sensor which can be compared to a human fingertip and is essential for the tactile acuity in robotic hands  The third and final tactile sensor type is a low spatial resolution sensor which has similar tactile acuity as the skin on one s back or arm              These sensors can be placed meaningfully throughout the surface of a prosthetic or a robot to give it the ability to sense touch in similar  if not better  ways than the human counterpart             


Signal processing edit 
Touch sensory signals can be generated by the robot s own movements  It is important to identify only the external tactile signals for accurate operations  Previous solutions employed the Wiener filter  which relies on the prior knowledge of signal statistics that are assumed to be stationary  Recent solution applies an adaptive filter to the robot s logic             It enables the robot to predict the resulting sensor signals of its internal motions  screening these false signals out  The new method improves contact detection and reduces false interpretation 

Usage edit 
            
Touch patterns enable robots to interpret human emotions in interactive applications  Four measurable features force  contact time  repetition  and contact area change can effectively categorize touch patterns through the temporal decision tree classifier to account for the time delay and associate them to human emotions with up to     accuracy             The Consistency Index            is applied at the end to evaluate the level of confidence of the system to prevent inconsistent reactions 
Robots use touch signals to map the profile of a surface in hostile environment such as a water pipe  Traditionally  a predetermined path was programmed into the robot  Currently  with the integration of touch sensors  the robots first acquire a random data point  the algorithm            of the robot will then determine the ideal position of the next measurement according to a set of predefined geometric primitives  This improves the efficiency by                
In recent years  using touch as a stimulus for interaction has been the subject of much study  In       the robot seal PARO was built  which reacts to many stimuli from human interaction  including touch  The therapeutic benefits of such human robot interaction is still being studied  but has shown very positive results             

Hearing edit 
Signal processing edit 
Accurate audio sensors require low internal noise contribution  Traditionally  audio sensors combine acoustical arrays and microphones to reduce internal noise level  Recent solutions combine also piezoelectric devices             These passive devices use the piezoelectric effect to transform force to voltage  so that the vibration that is causing the internal noise could be eliminated  On average  internal noise up to about  dB can be reduced            
Robots may interpret strayed noise as speech instructions  Current voice activity detection  VAD  system uses the complex spectrum circle centroid  CSCC  method and a maximum signal to noise ratio  SNR  beamformer              Because humans usually look at their partners when conducting conversations  the VAD system with two microphones enable the robot to locate the instructional speech by comparing the signal strengths of the two microphones  Current system is able to cope with background noise generated by televisions and sounding devices that come from the sides 

Usage edit 
Robots can perceive emotions through the way we talk and associated characteristics and features  Acoustic and linguistic features are generally used to characterize emotions  The combination of seven acoustic features and four linguistic features improves the recognition performance when compared to using only one set of features

Olfaction edit 
This section is an excerpt from Machine olfaction  edit 
Machine olfaction is the automated simulation of the sense of smell  An emerging application in modern engineering  it involves the use of robots or other automated systems to analyze air borne chemicals  Such an apparatus is often called an electronic nose or e nose   The development of machine olfaction is complicated by the fact that e nose devices to date have responded to a limited number of chemicals  whereas odors are produced by unique sets of  potentially numerous  odorant compounds  The technology  though still in the early stages of development  promises many applications  such as             
quality control in food processing  detection and diagnosis in medicine              detection of drugs  explosives and other dangerous or illegal substances              disaster response  and environmental monitoring 

One type of proposed machine olfaction technology is via gas sensor array instruments capable of detecting  identifying  and measuring volatile compounds  However  a critical element in the development of these instruments is pattern analysis  and the successful design of a pattern analysis system for machine olfaction requires a careful consideration of the various issues involved in processing multivariate data  signal preprocessing  feature extraction  feature selection  classification  regression  clustering  and validation              Another challenge in current research on machine olfaction is the need to predict or estimate the sensor response to aroma mixtures              Some pattern recognition problems in machine olfaction such as odor classification and odor localization can be solved by using time series kernel methods             
Taste edit 
This section is an excerpt from Electronic tongue  edit 
The electronic tongue is an instrument that measures and compares tastes  As per the IUPAC technical report  an  electronic tongue  as analytical instrument including an array of non selective chemical sensors with partial specificity to different solution components and an appropriate pattern recognition instrument  capable to recognize quantitative and qualitative compositions of simple and complex solutions                        
Chemical compounds responsible for taste are detected by human taste receptors  Similarly  the multi electrode sensors of electronic instruments detect the same dissolved organic and inorganic compounds  Like human receptors  each sensor has a spectrum of reactions different from the other  The information given by each sensor is complementary  and the combination of all sensors  results generates a unique fingerprint  Most of the detection thresholds of sensors are similar to or better than human receptors 
In the biological mechanism  taste signals are transduced by nerves in the brain into electric signals  E tongue sensors process is similar  they generate electric signals as voltammetric and potentiometric variations 

Taste quality perception and recognition are based on the building or recognition of activated sensory nerve patterns by the brain and the taste fingerprint of the product  This step is achieved by the e tongue s statistical software  which interprets the sensor data into taste patterns 
For example  robot cooks may be able to taste food for dynamic cooking             

Motion perception edit 
Robots at the RoboCup     
Usage edit 
Automated robots require a guidance system to determine the ideal path to perform its task  However  at the molecular scale  nano robots lack such guidance system because individual molecules cannot store complex motions and programs  Therefore  the only way to achieve motion in such environment is to replace sensors with chemical reactions  Currently  a molecular spider that has one streptavidin molecule as an inert body and three catalytic legs is able to start  follow  turn and stop when came across different DNA origami             The DNA based nano robots can move over          nm with a speed of        nm min            
In a TSI operation  which is an effective way to identify tumors and potentially cancer by measuring the distributed pressure at the sensor s contacting surface  excessive force may inflict a damage and have the chance of destroying the tissue  The application of robotic control to determine the ideal path of operation can reduce the maximum forces by     and gain a     increase in accuracy            compared to human doctors 

Performance edit 
Efficient robotic exploration saves time and resources  The efficiency is measured by optimality and competitiveness  Optimal boundary exploration is possible only when a robot has square sensing area  starts at the boundary  and uses the Manhattan metric              In complicated geometries and settings  a square sensing area is more efficient and can achieve better competitiveness regardless of the metric and of the starting point
