Signature
Gordon Earle Moore  January           March           was an American businessman  engineer  and the co founder and emeritus chairman of Intel Corporation  He proposed Moore s law which makes the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit  IC  doubles about every two years                                                        


Early life and education edit 
Gordon Moore was born in      as the second son of Walter Harold Moore  a sheriff in San Mateo County  and Florence Almira  Mira  Williamson  a homemaker              When Moore started school in       the faculty noted his introverted personality              His father accepted a promotion to deputy sheriff     further explanation needed      in      and moved the family to Redwood City  California              In       Moore received a chemistry set as a Christmas gift  which inspired him to become a chemist              From      to       Moore studied at Sequoia High School  where he was involved in athletic activities              From      to       Moore attended San Jos  State College  now San Jos  State University   studying chemistry              He transferred to University of California  Berkeley in       taking courses from Glenn Seaborg  Melvin Calvin  and William Giauque  He graduated in      with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry                         
In September       Moore enrolled at the California Institute of Technology   Caltech    where he would ultimately receive a Ph D  in chemistry in                                                       Moore conducted postdoctoral research at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University from      to                  

Scientific career edit 
Fairchild Semiconductor Laboratory edit 
Main article  Traitorous eight
Moore joined MIT and Caltech alumnus William Shockley at the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory division of Beckman Instruments  but left with the  traitorous eight   when Sherman Fairchild agreed to back them and created the influential Fairchild Semiconductor corporation                         

Moore s law edit 
Main article  Moore s law
In       Moore was working as the director of research and development  R amp D  at Fairchild Semiconductor  He was asked by Electronics Magazine to predict what he thought might happen in the semiconductor components industry over the next ten years  In an article published on April           Moore observed that the number of components  transistors  resistors  diodes  or capacitors              in a dense integrated circuit had doubled approximately every year and speculated that it would continue to do so for at least the next ten years  In       he revised the forecast rate to approximately every two years              Carver Mead popularized the phrase  Moore s law   The prediction has become a target for miniaturization in the semiconductor industry and has had widespread impact in many areas of technological change                        

Intel Corporation edit 
Main article  Intel
In July       Robert Noyce and Moore founded NM Electronics  which later became Intel Corporation                          Moore served as executive vice president until      when he became president  In April       Moore became chairman and chief executive officer  holding that position until April       when he became chairman  He was named chairman emeritus in                   Under Noyce  Moore  and later Andrew Grove  Intel pioneered new technologies for computer memory  integrated circuits  and microprocessor design              On April           Intel renamed its main Oregon site  the Ronler Acres campus in Hillsboro  as  Gordon Moore Park   and the building formerly known as RA   as  Moore Center   after Gordon Moore             

Philanthropy edit 
As of February       Moore s net worth was reported to be    billion             
In       Moore and his wife established the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation  with a gift worth about         billion  Through the foundation  they initially targeted environmental conservation  science  and the San Francisco Bay Area             
The foundation gives extensively in the area of environmental conservation  supporting major projects in the Andes Amazon Basin  including Brazil  Bolivia  Peru  Ecuador  Venezuela and Suriname  as well as the San Francisco Bay area                          Moore was a director of Conservation International for some years  In       he and Conservation International senior vice president Claude Gascon received the Order of the Golden Ark from Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands for their outstanding contributions to nature conservation             
Moore was a member of Caltech s board of trustees from       chairing it from      to       and was a life trustee at the time of his death                                      In       Moore and his wife donated           million to Caltech  at the time the largest gift ever to an institution of higher education              He said he wanted the gift to be used to keep Caltech at the forefront of research and technology             
In December       Moore and his wife donated           million to Caltech and the University of California for the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope  TMT   expected to become the world s second largest optical telescope once it and the European Extremely Large Telescope are completed in the mid     s  The TMT will have a segmented mirror    meters across and be built on Mauna Kea in Hawaii  This mirror will be nearly three times the size of the current record holder  the Large Binocular Telescope             
The Moores  as individuals and through their foundation  have also  in a series of gifts and grants beginning in the     s  given some      million to the University of California  Berkeley to fund initiatives ranging from materials science and physics to genomics and data science                                     
In addition  through the foundation  his wife created the Betty Irene Moore Nursing Initiative  targeting nursing care in the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Sacramento                          In       the foundation pledged      million over    years to establish a nursing school at the University of California  Davis              The Moores have also been long time benefactors of other Northern California institutions  including Stanford University  over      million as of        University of California  San Francisco  and University of California  Santa Cruz             
In       the Moores received the Andrew Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy

Personal life edit 
Moore in     
Moore met his wife  Betty Irene Whitaker  in      during a student government conference at the Asilomar Conference Grounds              They married in                   and Moore became a father to two sons  Kenneth Moore  b        and Steven Moore  b                    
Moore was an avid fisherman since childhood  and he traveled extensively with his wife  sons  or colleagues to catch species such as bass  marlin  salmon  and trout              He said his conservation efforts were partly inspired by his interest in fishing and his time spent outdoors             
In       Moore s was the first human genome sequenced on Ion Torrent s Personal Genome Machine platform  a massively parallel sequencing device  which uses ISFET biosensors             
Moore died at his home in Waimea  Hawaii on March           aged                 He was remembered by the San Francisco Chronicle as a  Silicon Valley icon who co founded Intel               The Intel CEO at the time  Pat Gelsinger remembered him as someone who   defined the technology industry through his insight and vision
