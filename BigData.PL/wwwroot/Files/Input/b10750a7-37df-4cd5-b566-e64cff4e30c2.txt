Egypt s  remarkable progress  represents  hope  for stability in the Middle East  according to the United Arab Emirates   UAE  Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan 
Al Nahyan said on Saturday that the UAE  hopes for the recovery and restoration of security and stability in the region  adding that the Egypt  and its good governance in implementing its political roadmap  represents this move toward regional stability 
Al Nahyan  speaking at the   th United Nations General Assembly  said the UAE  regrets the statements of some countries and their unacceptable questioning of the legitimacy of the Egyptian government   stressing that the current government was  freely elected by its people  who believe in their ability to fulfil their aspirations  
The UAE foreign minister stressed   Questioning the Egyptian people s will and their right to choose their representatives is an interference in the internal affairs of Egypt and undermines its stability  
President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi claimed a landslide election victory in June and appointed Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb who in turn appointed the current cabinet of ministers  Parliamentary elections are expected later this year 
During his speech at the General Assembly  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was highly critical of the United Nations  response to the military backed ouster of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi in July       Egypt s foreign ministry rejected his comments and cancelled a scheduled bilateral meeting that was set to take place on the sidelines of the international assembly at the UN headquarters in New York 
Arab League Secretary General Nabil El Araby also condemned Erdogan s comments  describing them as an  interference of internal Arab affairs  
The UAE has been a strong backer of Egypt since Morsi s removal  pledging a   bn aid package to Egypt following the change of power last summer  as well as shipments of fuel worth     m and a further   bn of aid in the form of deposits and grants 
Al Nahyan  citing the importance of Egypt to regional security  called on the international community to  provide the necessary support to the Egyptian government and its economy to boost their efforts towards achieving progress and prosperity   He also thanked Saudi Arabia for its support for Egypt s economy for the announcement of  The Egyptian Economic Summit   scheduled for February       Saudi Arabia also announced billions of dollars worth of aid for Egypt following Morsi s ouster
