							BUENOS AIRES  Diego Maradona has found another job he       d like  mdash  coach of Boca Juniors 
Almost five months after being released as Argentina coach  Maradona said he like to lead Boca Juniors  the Buenos Aires club where he became a star 
The favorite to take over Boca is Banfield coach Julio Cesar Falcioni  but Maradona seems to be lobbying hard for the job 
Maradona acknowledged on Thursday in an interview with the magazine Gente that he       d need to mend his relationship with Boca       s top player Juan Roman Riquelme  Riquelme played briefly for Maradona on the national team  but then declined to continue  mdash  apparently angry that Maradona had criticized his style of play 
 quot I       d die to lead Boca  but first I should talk with Riquelme  quot  Maradona told the magazine   quot There are many things I have to talk about with many people  quot 
The Boca position became available when Claudio Borghi resigned last month  Interim coach Roberto Pompei has handled the team since then and Boca is expected to name a new coach before the Clausura opens in January 
In addition to Falcioni  Racing coach Miguel Angel Russo has been mentioned as a candidate  along with Carlos Bianchi  who is out of a coaching job 
Maradona      was dismissed as Argentina coach following a humiliating     loss to Germany in the World Cup quarterfinals  The Argentina Football Association would have kept Maradona  but demanded he dismiss several of his assistant coaches as a condition for keeping the job 
Maradona declined and was let go in the midst of a national debate about coaching acumen 
Several months later  before Sergio Batista was named the new national coach  Maradona said he       d consider firing his assistants in order to get his job back 
Maradona remains popular and has popped up in public from time to time since losing his job  appearing at a recent Real Madrid training session and last week at the ATP World Tour Finals in London
