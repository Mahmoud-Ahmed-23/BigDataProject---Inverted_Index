Life and career edit 
Dreyfus was born on    October       in Terre Haute  Indiana  to Stanley S  and Irene  Lederer  Dreyfus                       
He attended Harvard University from                  With a senior honors thesis on Causality and Quantum Theory  for which W  V  O  Quine was the main examiner             he was awarded a B A  summa cum laude in                 and joined Phi Beta Kappa              He was awarded a M A  in                              He was a Teaching Fellow at Harvard in            as he was again in      and                    Then  on a Harvard Sheldon traveling fellowship  Dreyfus studied at the University of Freiburg over                        During this time he had an interview with Martin Heidegger             Sean D  Kelly records that Dreyfus found the meeting  disappointing               Brief mention of it was made by Dreyfus during his      BBC interview with Bryan Magee in remarks that are revealing of both his and Heidegger s opinion of the work of Jean Paul Sartre                        
Between      and       Dreyfus undertook research at the Husserl Archives at the University of Louvain on a Fulbright Fellowship              Towards the end of his stay  his first  jointly authored  paper  Curds and Lions in Don Quijote  would appear in print                          After acting as an instructor in philosophy at Brandeis University                                     he attended the Ecole Normale Sup rieure  Paris  on a French government grant                         
From       first as an instructor  then as an assistant and then associate professor  Dreyfus taught philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT              In       with his dissertation Husserl s Phenomenology of Perception  he obtained his Ph D  from Harvard                           Due to his knowledge of Husserl  Dagfinn F llesdal sat on the thesis committee but he has asserted that Dreyfus  was not really my student                 That same year  his co translation  with his first wife  of Sense and Non Sense by Maurice Merleau Ponty was published            
Also in       and whilst still at MIT  he was employed as a consultant by the RAND Corporation to review the work of Allen Newell and Herbert A  Simon in the field of artificial intelligence  AI              This resulted in the publication  in       of the  famously combative  Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence  which proved to be the first of a series of papers and books attacking the AI field s claims and assumptions                          The first edition of What Computers Can t Do would follow in       and this critique of AI  which has been translated into at least ten languages  would establish Dreyfus s public reputation             However  as the editors of his Festschrift noted   the study and interpretation of  continental  philosophers    came first in the order of his philosophical interests and influences             

Dreyfus  left  outside his Berkeley home in     
Berkeley edit 
In       although he had been granted tenure  Dreyfus left MIT and became an associate professor of philosophy at the University of California  Berkeley                          winning  that same year  the Harbison Prize for Outstanding Teaching              In      he was promoted to full professor                         Though Dreyfus retired from his chair in       he continued as professor of philosophy in the Graduate School  and held  from       a joint appointment in the rhetoric department              He continued to teach philosophy at UC Berkeley until his last class in December                 
Dreyfus was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in                    He was also awarded an honorary doctorate for  his brilliant and highly influential work in the field of artificial intelligence  and his interpretation of twentieth century continental philosophy by Erasmus University            
Dreyfus died on April                                 
His younger brother and sometimes collaborator  Stuart Dreyfus  is a professor emeritus of industrial engineering and operations research at the University of California  Berkeley 

Dreyfus  criticism of AI edit 
Main article  Hubert Dreyfus s views on artificial intelligence
Dreyfus  critique of artificial intelligence  AI  concerns what he considers to be the four primary assumptions of AI research  The first two assumptions are what he calls the  biological  and  psychological  assumptions  The biological assumption is that the brain is analogous to computer hardware and the mind is analogous to computer software  The psychological assumption is that the mind works by performing discrete computations  in the form of algorithmic rules  on discrete representations or symbols 
Dreyfus claims that the plausibility of the psychological assumption rests on two others  the epistemological and ontological assumptions   The epistemological assumption is that all activity  either by animate or inanimate objects  can be formalized  mathematically  in the form of predictive rules or laws  The ontological assumption is that reality consists entirely of a set of mutually independent  atomic  indivisible  facts  It s because of the epistemological assumption that workers in the field argue that intelligence is the same as formal rule following  and it s because of the ontological one that they argue that human knowledge consists entirely of internal representations of reality 
On the basis of these two assumptions  workers in the field claim that cognition is the manipulation of internal symbols by internal rules  and that  therefore  human behaviour is  to a large extent  context free  see contextualism   Therefore  a truly scientific psychology is possible  which will detail the  internal  rules of the human mind  in the same way the laws of physics detail the  external  laws of the physical world  However  it is this key assumption that Dreyfus denies  In other words  he argues that we cannot now  and never will be able to  understand our own behavior in the same way as we understand objects in  for example  physics or chemistry  that is  by considering ourselves as things whose behaviour can be predicted via  objective   context free scientific laws  According to Dreyfus  a context free psychology is a contradiction in terms 
Dreyfus s arguments against this position are taken from the phenomenological and hermeneutical tradition  especially the work of Martin Heidegger   Heidegger argued that  contrary to the cognitivist views  on which AI has been based   our being is in fact highly context bound  which is why the two context free assumptions are false  Dreyfus doesn t deny that we can choose to see human  or any  activity as being  law governed   in the same way that we can choose to see reality as consisting of indivisible atomic facts    if we wish  But it is a huge leap from that to state that because we want to or can see things in this way that it is therefore an objective fact that they are the case  In fact  Dreyfus argues that they are not  necessarily  the case  and that  therefore  any research program that assumes they are will quickly run into profound theoretical and practical problems  Therefore  the current efforts of workers in the field are doomed to failure 
Dreyfus argues that to get a device or devices with human like intelligence would require them to have a human like being in the world and to have bodies more or less like ours  and social acculturation  i e  a society  more or less like ours   This view is shared by psychologists in the embodied psychology  Lakoff and Johnson       and distributed cognition traditions  His opinions are similar to those of robotics researchers such as Rodney Brooks as well as researchers in the field of artificial life  
Contrary to a popular misconception  Dreyfus never predicted that computers would never beat humans at chess  In Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence  he only reported  correctly  the state of the art of the time   Still no chess program can play even amateur chess                                      
Daniel Crevier writes   time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus s comments  Had he formulated them less aggressively  constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier              

Webcasting philosophy edit 
When UC Berkeley and Apple began making a selected number of lecture classes freely available to the public as podcasts beginning around       a recording of Dreyfus teaching a course called  Man  God  and Society in Western Literature        From Gods to God and Back  rose to the   th most popular webcast on iTunes              These webcasts have attracted the attention of many  including non academics  to Dreyfus and his subject area
