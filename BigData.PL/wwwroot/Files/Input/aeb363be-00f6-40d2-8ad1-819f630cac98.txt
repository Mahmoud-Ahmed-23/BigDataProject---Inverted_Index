Hypothetical concept of storing a personality in digital form
Digital immortality  or  virtual immortality              is the hypothetical concept of storing  or cloning  a person s personality in digital substrate  i e   a computer  robot or cyberspace             mind uploading   The result might look like an avatar behaving  reacting  and thinking like a person on the basis of that person s digital archive                                              After the death of the individual  this avatar could remain static or continue to learn and self improve autonomously  possibly becoming seed AI  
A considerable portion of transhumanists and singularitarians place great hope into the belief that they may eventually become immortal            by creating one or many non biological functional copies of their brains  thereby leaving their  biological shell   These copies may then  live eternally  in a version of digital  heaven  or paradise                       


Realism edit 
The National Science Foundation has awarded a half million dollar grant to the universities of Central Florida at Orlando and Illinois at Chicago to explore how researchers might use artificial intelligence  archiving  and computer imaging to create convincing  digital versions of real people  a possible first step toward virtual immortality             
The Digital Immortality Institute explores three factors necessary for digital immortality  First  at whatever level of implementation  avatars require guaranteed Internet accessibility  Next  avatars must be what users specify  and they must remain so  Finally  future representations must be secured before the living users are no more             
The aim of Dmitry Itskov s      Initiative is to  create technologies enabling the clone of an individual s personality to a non biological carrier  and extending existence  including to the point of immortality              

Method edit 
Reaching digital immortality is a two step process 

archiving and digitizing people             
making the avatar live
Digital immortality has been argued to go beyond technical processes of digitization of people  and encompass social aspects as well  For example  Joshua Hurtado             has presented a four step framework in which the digital immortalization of people could preserve the social bond between the living and the dead  These steps are     data gathering     data codification     data activation  and    data embodiment  Each of these steps is linked to a form of preserving the social bond  either through talk  embodied emotionality  expressing emotions through one s form of embodiment  or monumentalism  creating a monument  in this case in digital form  to remember the dead  

Archiving and digitizing people edit 
According to Gordon Bell and Jim Gray from Microsoft Research  retaining every conversation that a person has ever heard is already realistic  it needs less than a terabyte of storage  for adequate quality                           The speech or text recognition technologies are one of the biggest challenges of the concept 
A second possibility would be to archive and analyze social Internet use to map the personality of people  By analyzing social Internet use during    years  it would be possible to model a society s culture  a society s way of thinking  and a society s interests 
Martine Rothblatt envisions the creation of  mindfiles    collections of data from all kinds of sources  including the photos we upload to Facebook  the discussions and opinions we share on forums or blogs  and other social media interactions that reflect our life experiences and our unique self                        
Richard Grandmorin             summarized the concept of digital immortality by the following equation   semantic analysis   social internet use   Artificial Intelligence   immortality  
Some find that photos  videos  soundclips  social media posts and other data of oneself could already be regarded as such an archiving                                                
Susanne Asche states 

As a hopefully minimalistic definition then  digital immortality can be roughly considered as involving a person centric repository containing a copy of everything that a person sees  hears  says  or engenders over his or her lifespan  including photographs  videos  audio recordings  movies  television shows  music albums CDs  newspapers  documents  diaries and journals  interviews  meetings  love letters  notes  papers  art pieces  and so on  and so on  and if not everything  then at least as much as the person has and takes the time and trouble to include  The person s personality  emotion profiles  thoughts  beliefs  and appearance are also captured and integrated into an artificially intelligent  interactive  con versational agent avatar  This avatar is placed in charge of  and perhaps  equated  with  the collected material in the repository so that the agent can present the illusion of having the factual memories  thoughts  and beliefs of the person him herself         Susanne Asche  Kulturelles Ged chtnis im     Jahrhundert  Tagungsband des internationalen Symposiums  Digital Immortality  amp  Runaway Technology            
Mindclone generation edit 
Rothblatt proposes the term  mindware  for software that is being developed with the goal of generating conscious AIs  Such software would read a person s  mindfile  to generate a  mindclone   Rothblatt also proposes a certain level of governmental approval for mindware  like an FDA certification  to ensure that the resulting mindclones are well made                        

Calibration process edit 
During the calibration process  the biological people are living at the same time as their artifact in silicon  The artifact in silicon is calibrated to be as close as possible to the person in question 
During this process ongoing updates  synchronization  and interaction between the two minds would maintain the twin minds as one                        

Ethics edit 
According to Boston University s Magazine              the advancement of Artificial Intelligence  AI  is ushering humanity into a realm where the boundary between the living and the deceased is becoming increasingly blurred              James Trew s             article talks about generative technology like ChatGPT and Midjourney  James Trew s article              Digital  immortality  is coming and we re not ready for it  provides information about the misfortune of sorting through the possessions of a dead relative and using it for other circumstances                         
However  with these advancements come a myriad of ethical and legal dilemmas  particularly concerning digital remains and postmortem privacy                         

Mourning and digital remains edit 
Martine Rothblatt             wrote a book about the ethics in digital immortality and made a point about how one of the central questions raised by digital immortality is the nature of identity and authenticity in a digital form  Rothblatt delves into the concept of continuity of consciousness and whether a digital replica of a person can truly capture their essence or if it is merely a simulation 
Like Melody Parker             says in their article  to communicate with someone on the other side of the veil  you don t need a Ouija board or s ance  Artificial intelligence may transform the way we grieve as like the author some             view it as a source of solace  others argue it may hinder the natural progression of grief like Rothblatt                         

Postmortem privacy and digital immortality edit 
As AI enabled replicas interact with the world  concerns emerge about the privacy and autonomy of the deceased              According to Vin cius Ferreira Galv o              their article   Discussing human values in digital immortality  towards a value oriented perspective   they had stated questions to how ethical issues are regarded after the death of an individual  Questions like  Who owns the data related to the deceased if he she has not delegated an heir  If a perfect digital copy of the deceased is possible  should it be treated similarly as any human being   arise                         
Fiorenza Gamba              the author of  AI  mourning and digital immortality  Some ethical questions on digital remain and post mortem privacy  made claims about the post mortem privacy against digital immortality  The article makes a claim stating that  Holograms  digital twins and chatbots are increasingly used to reproduce the likenesses  behaviours and emotions of the deceased  Moreover  such technologies enable these replicas to interact with the survivors                          

Legal implications edit 
According to Bell and Gray s article               Digital Immortality   Communications of the ACM  digital immortality manifests in various forms  from one way immortality where data is preserved for future generations to two way immortality where individuals can communicate with artificial versions of the deceased                         

Feasibility of mind uploading edit 
David Pearce  a prominent advocate of transhumanism  challenges the feasibility of uploading human brains into computers  He argues that while computers are capable of executing complex computations  they lack the ability to replicate the subjective experiences and sentience inherent to consciousness  Pearce emphasizes that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of data processing but involves qualitative  non computational phenomena that current and foreseeable technologies cannot replicate  This perspective casts doubt on the notion that minds can be fully transferred to a digital substrate
