A paralegal  also known as a legal assistant or paralegal specialist  is a legal professional who performs tasks that require knowledge of legal concepts but not the full expertise of a lawyer with an admission to practice law  The market for paralegals is broad  including consultancies  companies that have legal departments or that perform legislative and regulatory compliance activities in areas such as environment  labor  intellectual property  zoning  and tax  Legal offices and public bodies also have many paralegals in support activities using other titles outside of the standard titles used in the profession      citation needed      There is a diverse array of work experiences attainable within the paralegal  legal assistance  field  ranging between internship  entry level  associate  junior  mid senior  and senior level positions 
In the United States in       the American Bar Association  ABA  endorsed the concept of the paralegal and  in       established its first committee on legal assistants  In       the ABA amended their definition of paralegal removing the reference to legal assistants  The current definition reads as follows   A paralegal is a person  qualified by education  training  or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer  law office  corporation  governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible  
The exact nature of their work and limitations that the law places on the tasks that they are allowed to perform vary between nations and jurisdictions  Paralegals generally are not allowed to offer legal services independently in most jurisdictions  In some jurisdictions  paralegals can conduct their own business and provide services such as settlements  court filings  legal research and other auxiliary legal services  these tasks often have instructions from a solicitor attached  
Recently  some US and Canadian jurisdictions have begun creating a new profession where experienced paralegals are being licensed  with or without attorney supervision  to allow limited scope of practice in high need practice areas such as family law  bankruptcy and landlord tenant law in an effort to combat the access to justice crisis  The education  experience  testing  and scope of practice requirements vary widely across the various jurisdictions  So too are the number of titles jurisdictions are using for these new practitioners  including Limited License Legal Technician  Licensed Paralegals  Licensed Paraprofessionals  Limited Licensed Paralegals  Limited License Paraprofessionals  Allied Legal Professionals  etc  
In the United States  a paralegal is protected from some forms of professional liability under the theory that paralegals are working as an enhancement of an attorney  who takes ultimate responsibility for the supervision of the paralegal s work and work product  Paralegals often have taken a prescribed series of courses in law and legal processes  Paralegals may analyze and summarize depositions  prepare and answer interrogatories  draft procedural motions and other routine briefs  perform legal research and analysis  legislative assistance  legislative research   draft research memos  and perform some quasi secretarial or legal secretarial duties  as well as perform case and project management  Paralegals often handle drafting much of the paperwork in probate cases  divorce actions  bankruptcies  and investigations  Consumers of legal services are typically billed for the time paralegals spend on their cases  In the United States  they are not authorized by the government or other agency to offer legal services  including legal advice  except in some cases in Washington State  through LLLT designation  in the same way as lawyers  nor are they officers of the court  nor are they usually subject to government sanctioned or court sanctioned rules of conduct  In some jurisdictions  Ontario  Canada  for example  paralegals are licensed and regulated the same way that lawyers are and these licensed professionals may be permitted to provide legal services to the public and appear before certain lower courts and administrative tribunals 


Official definitions edit 
Various professional organizations offer varying definitions of a paralegal 

From the National Federation of Paralegal Associations  NFPA   US     A paralegal is a person  qualified through education  training or work experience to perform substantive legal work that requires knowledge of legal concepts and is customarily  but not exclusively  performed by a lawyer  This person may be retained or employed by a lawyer  law office  governmental agency or other entity or may be authorized by administrative  statutory or court authority to perform this work  Substantive shall mean work requiring recognition  evaluation  organization  analysis  and communication of relevant facts and legal concepts             
From the National Association of Legal Assistants  NALA   US     Legal Assistants  also known as paralegals  are a distinguishable group of persons who assist attorneys in the delivery of legal services  Through formal education  training and experience  Legal Assistants have knowledge and expertise regarding the legal system and substantive and procedural law which qualify them to do work of a legal nature under the supervision of an attorney   This is the NALA s former      definition  In       the organization adopted the American Bar Association s  ABA  definition of a paralegal Legal Assistant            
From National Association of Legal Secretaries  NALS   US    A Legal Assistant  qualified by education  training or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer  law office  corporation  governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible             
From the American Association for Paralegal Education  AAfPE   USA    Paralegals perform substantive and procedural legal work as authorized by law  which work  in the absence of the paralegal  would be performed by an attorney  Paralegals have knowledge of the law gained through education  or education and work experience  which qualifies them to perform legal work  Paralegals adhere to recognized ethical standards and rules of professional responsibility             
From the Institute of Paralegals  United Kingdom    A paralegal is a non lawyer who does legal work that previously would have been done by a lawyer  or if done by a lawyer  would be charged for  
From the Paralegal Society of Ontario  Canada    A paralegal is an individual qualified through education or experience licensed to provide legal services to the general public in areas authorized by the Law Society of Upper Canada             
From the National Association of Licensed Paralegals  United Kingdom    A person who is educated and trained to perform legal tasks but who is not a qualified solicitor or barrister  
Difference from legal secretaries edit 
A legal secretary is generally a secretary who has a basic understanding of legal terminology and the specific formatting required by a particular court or government agency  Legal secretaries are also typically responsible for keeping case files organized and indexed  often taking on the duties of a file clerk  Although legal secretaries may be trained to prepare some basic legal papers and letters  they generally have little or no knowledge of particular legal doctrines  statutes or regulations  and typically have no training or experience in conducting legal research or drafting legal documents  pleadings  motions  briefs or other court papers  On the other hand  a typical paralegal in the United States can perform all of these tasks under an attorney or law office   Paralegals bill for their time at a higher rate than legal secretaries 
In Canada the title Legal Secretary is outdated  The recognized title of that position is Legal Administrative Assistant  or Legal Assistant 

Education  training  and certification edit 
Though not required in most jurisdictions  many paralegals have completed a formal paralegal education program  Formal paralegal education programs may result in a diploma  higher diploma  advanced diploma  vocational education  associate degree  bachelor s degree  master s degree  or graduate certificate programs in the academic discipline of legal management and paralegal studies  or a paralegal professional certificate of continuing education              Others may enter through adjacent fields of study such as bachelor s  academic minors  master s  or graduate certificate degree programs in criminology and the sociology of law  political science  public administration  legal studies  sociology  literature and creative writing  history  philosophy  other fields in the social sciences  humanities  and liberal arts  or proof of higher education in any field of study or academic discipline  Many paralegals have completed all of their training or obtained a higher education degree in an adjacent field before entering the profession  while some  mostly those of the Baby Boomers Generation and some older Gen Xers unlike many Millennials  Gen Zers  and younger Gen Xers  have only on the job training entering only with a high school diploma and no formal higher education which was a common phenomenon during that time  with others later on completing their education while working their way up from some administrative assistance or secretarial positions in law firms  in house legal departments  or government agencies where depending on the type of work completed may or may not have required a bachelor s degree level of specialized knowledge in a given field  Many paralegals take Continuing Legal Education  CLE   Continuing Education Unit  CEU   or Continuing Professional Development  CPD  courses to fulfill the requirements of their firm  employer  government appointed regulatory body  association  or to obtain and maintain a professional certificate or license to practice 

Economics edit 
Paralegals exist precisely because they are not lawyers and thus can do the work more cheaply             Other than expertise  the main constraint on what work a paralegal can or cannot do tends to be local rules that reserve particular activities to lawyers  Some jurisdictions have a reserved activities list 
According to United States law      citation needed      there are five specific acts which only a licensed attorney can perform 

Establish the attorney client relationship
Give legal advice
Sign legal papers and pleadings on behalf of a party
Appear in court on behalf of another  i e  the client            
Set and collect fees for legal services
Beyond the five acts above  the paralegal can perform practically any other task  including legal research  legal writing  factual investigation  preparation of exhibits  and the day to day tasks of case management  The key is that attorneys are entirely responsible for the actions of their paralegals and  by signing and filing court documents drafted by paralegals  or law clerks   attorneys make those documents their own 

Trends in use edit 
In the United States  the need for accredited qualifications and bar licensure limits the number of licensed attorneys  There are some tasks for which a bar license is unnecessary but some amount of legal training is helpful  To lower costs  businesses may choose to employ paralegals to undertake such tasks  Paralegal time is typically billed at only a fraction of what a lawyer charges  and thus to the paralegal has fallen those substantive and procedural tasks which are too complex for legal secretaries  whose time is not billed  but for which lawyers can no longer bill  This in turn makes lawyers more efficient by allowing them to concentrate solely on the substantive legal issues of the case  while paralegals have become the  case managers  
The growing demand of paralegal professionals at a rapid rate has resulted in schools and colleges catering to such education being established in many places  It has been found through a survey that currently        students are enrolled in paralegal education courses      citation needed      The American Association for Paralegal Education  AAPE  itself has more than     members      of them are ABA approved      citation needed      Seminars and events are being held by various institutes to help broaden the knowledge base of the paralegal service providers and the importance associated with it  Although the nation is experiencing a recession  the paralegal profession continues to grow  Law firms and legal departments are cutting costs and increasing access to legal services by hiring paralegals 
The United Kingdom has gone one step further  Much legal work by lawyers for the poorer elements of society is legally aided  or paid for by the state  As overall costs have risen due to more people than ever engaging with the law  the government has reduced such legal aid  As a result  the work has become uneconomic for many and they have ceased doing it  Paralegal advisory firms are stepping in to fill the gap      citation needed     
The increased use of paralegals has slowed the rising cost of legal services and serves in some small measure  in combination with contingency fees and insurance  to keep the cost of legal services within the reach of the regular population  However  one commentator has warned that  our profession makes a serious error if it uses legal assistants only as economic tools             

Paralegal medical consultants edit 
Some attorneys who practice in fields involving medical care have only a limited knowledge of healthcare and medical concepts and terminology  Therefore  legal medical consultants which are professional physicians  physician assistants  paramedics  nurses and respiratory therapists  have become fully trained as paralegals in the manner described above and assist behind the scenes on these cases  in addition to serving as expert witnesses from time to time

Australia edit 
Australia has a distinct regime for the utilization of paralegals               According to one paralegal studies scholar 

The legal profession s monopoly in Australia is  however  confined to the right of appearance in a court of law and to the preparation of certain documents for reward  which leaves a vast field of legal tasks open to performance by other workers  including paralegals         Jill Irene Cowley            
Furthermore  Australian paralegals have  little formal recognition of  or status accorded  them  yet they  require specialist education              

Canada edit 
In Canada  paralegals are typically trained assistants who work under the supervision of lawyers and are not regulated as independent professionals  except in the Canadian province of Ontario  In Ontario  paralegals are licensed professionals regulated by legislation              
Some provinces  like British Columbia  allow lawyers to designate certain paralegals to provide additional services to clients  However  in most cases  lawyers remain fully responsible for all action or omission of the designated paralegals             

Ontario edit 
In Ontario  paralegals are licensed by the Law Society of Ontario              Ontario is with Washington State the only jurisdiction in the western hemisphere where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court  Licensed paralegals operate within a defined scope of practice  representing clients in matters such as provincial offenses  traffic tickets  etc    immigration  landlord and tenant disputes  labor law  small claims court  up to           and specific criminal matters  They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or wills and estates   By virtue of their office  licensed paralegals are commissioners for taking affidavits  swearing oaths  
In the province of Ontario paralegals are a regulated body within the legal system  Paralegals become commissioners upon licensing              and may become non lawyer notaries  Crown prosecutor  municipal prosecutor or a justice of the peace if appointed 
Ontario recently became the first jurisdiction in North America to provide for the licensing of independent paralegals  This task will be the responsibility of the Law Society of Ontario  founded in        which already regulates Ontario s        or so lawyers  Aspiring paralegals must complete an accredited educational program and complete a licensing exam  The Society will also be responsible for disciplining paralegals who do not conform to rules of professional conduct  known as the Paralegal Rules of Conduct 
In Ontario  as of December       licensed paralegals are now endorsed and recognized as officers of the court             
The Law Society began issuing the first paralegal licenses to grandparent applicants who fulfilled all the necessary licensing requirements  including insurance  in April                    Paralegals who provide legal services to the public must carry professional liability insurance in accordance with By Law    Part II  section         Licensees must provide written proof of their compliance with this requirement to carry mandatory insurance before they begin providing legal services  as well as on an annual basis               Paralegal services may be provided via a sole proprietorship  partnership or professional corporation   Licensees are strongly encouraged to seek professional advice on the best business structure for their particular situations              A paralegal license allows a paralegal to independently represent clients in provincial offences court  summary conviction criminal court  small claims court and administrative tribunals such as the Financial Services Commission of Ontario or the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board  The role that a paralegal has in the United States is similar to the role of a law clerk or legal assistant in Ontario  Many paralegals in Ontario work in the areas of permitted practice for paralegals and also work alongside lawyers in areas of practice that are only permitted to be practiced by lawyers  It is illegal for paralegals in Ontario to independently practice in an area of law that is permitted only for lawyers  An example of this is family law  or an indictable offence in criminal law 
All lawyers and paralegals who practice law and provide legal services in Ontario  are required to complete the CPD program  Continuing professional development  CPD  is the maintenance and enhancement of a lawyer or paralegal s professional knowledge  skills  attitudes and professionalism throughout the individual s career  It is a positive tool that benefits lawyers and paralegals and is an essential component of the commitment they make to the public to practice law or provide legal services competently and ethically             

Japan edit 
Main article  Judicial scrivener
In Japan  the institution of judicial scrivener        shih  shoshi  exists  and functions similarly to paralegals  Scriveners perform legal work  above the level of secretary but below the level of attorney  and may be attached to an attorney s office or operate independently  Scriveners may represent clients in some low level matters  but not in more advanced stages of litigation  As with lawyers in Japan  scriveners are regulated and must pass an exam 

South Africa edit 
In South Africa  legal assistants or paralegals must have extensive knowledge of the law and the administration of justice  Their duties may include  liaising with clients of their employers to assist in solving legal problems  legal research  preparing cases for court and liaising with the public  This programme is uniquely designed to impart a comprehensive overview of all aspects of paralegal specialisation and an understanding of individual rights and the rights of others  Paralegal offers the use and application of skills and competencies related to criminal law and procedure  civil litigation  wills and estates  dispute resolution  legal advice  property law and conveyancing as well as legal office practice management and debt collecting counselling      citation needed     
Paralegals in South Africa are hired mostly by Legal Aid South Africa  big corporations  Patent law firms  legal firms  Estate agents  Government Departments etc  to provide legal support to those corporate world  Legal support may be by legal research  investigation inspectors  legal advice or legal assistance  Certification may be acquired at  Tshwane University of Technology National Diploma in Legal Assistance Paralegal  University of Johannesburg Diploma in Paralegal  UNISA National Diploma in Law  South African School of Paralegals  Intec College Diploma in Paralegal  South African Law School Qualification in Paralegal  Damelin College Paralegal  Boston City Campus Paralegal certificate  Salaries range from R       to R        per year depending on experience 
Newly established law firms in South Africa are likely to hire qualified Paralegals with   year qualification in Legal Studies to provide Legal assistance  Though the South African Law Society and The Minister of Justice do want to come with regulation to guide paralegals in South Africa just like Canada and the US  many practicing attorneys and Advocates did disprove in many instances however the new legislation is pending      citation needed     

South Korea edit 
Paralegals are not regulated and work as assistants to lawyers in law offices  There is a role of Judicial Scrivener  but it is a different legal role in South Korea

Main article  Judicial scrivener
In South Korea a similar system to the Japanese exists  and is known as beopmusa  Hangul       Hanja        but they cannot be compared to the role of a paralegal  as beopmusa s can open their own offices and take on tasks of lawyers similar to notaries

United Kingdom edit 
England and Wales edit 
The original concept of paralegals in the UK started with the Paralegal Association in the mid     s  now the National Association of Licensed Paralegals   However the oldest incorporated professional body for paralegals in the UK who set the competency standards for paralegals and legal secretaries  issue legal qualifications  and support  represent and promote paralegals is the Institute of Paralegals 
Both the Association and Institute have a similar role in recognizing and registering paralegals but do not always agree on all the principles of practice     citation needed      
However  it is only recently that paralegals have begun to be seen as more than merely assistants to qualified lawyers  They are now a newly emergent  and increasingly distinct  group of legal professionals 
Due to a lack of metrics it is unclear exactly how many paralegals there are in the United Kingdom  The Office of National Statistics and the register of Standard Occupational Classification estimate that there are currently        mid skilled  legal associate professionals   Research published in      by the Institute for Public Policy Research  IPPR  predicts that this figure is set to grow by     within the next decade              Moreover  it is estimated that there are now almost       government registered regulated paralegal advisory firms offering services that would previously have been offered only by lawyers      citation needed     This is because most legal work in the United Kingdom is deregulated and therefore there is nothing to stop anyone from opening their own paralegal law firm             
As the term  paralegal  is not protected like the term  solicitor  anyone may call himself herself a paralegal without any qualification or registrations              Professional bodies are lobbying for this to change and the term  paralegal  to become a protected title            
Paralegals in England and Wales may only offer limited legal advice  as may any person  with the following exceptions strictly forbidden 

Undertaking the activities reserved to solicitors under the Solicitors Act      
Undertaking immigration work if not registered with the Office of the Immigrations Services Commissioner 
Undertaking certain types of claims compensation related work if not registered with the Ministry of Justice 
In the United Kingdom  the Solicitors Act                  reserves certain activities for solicitors  Broadly  these include 

Preparing and lodging documents concerning the conveying or charging of land  Since repealed and now also conducted by Licensed Conveyancers
Undertaking probate law 
Undertaking litigation  except in the small claims court  
Paralegals technically have very limited rights to conduct litigation rights of audience before courts tribunals  In practice though many appear in courts and particularly tribunals at all levels as assistants 
Paralegals also act as Police Station Representatives if they are accredited  giving general advice to clients held in police custody 

Scotland edit 
Scotland has separate legal jurisdiction from England and Wales  The term  paralegal  came into use from the     s  There have always been individuals undertaking legal work but not qualified as a solicitor but they would have had other titles such as  legal assistant   From the early     s the term  paralegal  became more common  In      Scottish Paralegals Association was founded              It is a voluntary body whose remit is to promote the interests of paralegals in Scotland  From      Scotland s colleges began to offer paralegal qualifications  awarded by the Scottish Qualification Authority  namely the Higher National Diploma and Certificate in Legal Services  They were offered by Central College of Commerce  Stevenson College and Dundee College  As a result of the efforts of the Scottish Paralegal Association and in particular its president Christine Lambie  in      the Law Society of Scotland  the solicitors  professional body  instituted the Law Society of Scotland Registered Paralegal scheme  This was a voluntary scheme providing a professional status for high quality paralegals  Around     paralegals  mainly individuals who had come through the ranks in legal firms  joined the scheme  From      Scottish Qualification Authority and Stirling University offered qualifications for individuals wishing to enter the Registered Paralegal profession  Paralegals qualify in particular legal domains  e g   Domestic Conveyancing  and Wills  amp  Executries  In      the name of the scheme was changed to Law Society of Scotland Accredited Paralegal scheme             

Professional societies edit

United States edit 
Badge of US Air Force Paralegals
In the United States  paralegals originated as assistants to lawyers at a time when only lawyers offered legal services  In those jurisdictions where the local legal profession judiciary is involved in paralegal recognition accreditation  the profession of paralegal still basically refers to those people working under the direct supervision of a lawyer  The profession of paralegal varies greatly between the states  because some states do require paralegals to be licensed  In other jurisdictions however  such as the United Kingdom  the lack of local legal profession judiciary oversight means that the definition of paralegal encompasses non lawyers doing legal work  regardless of whom they do it for  Although most jurisdictions recognize paralegals to a greater or lesser extent  there is no international consistency as to definition  job role  status  terms and conditions of employment  training  regulation or anything else and so each jurisdiction must be looked at individually 
In the United States  there is no such thing as a paralegal licensed by a government body  rather  paralegals can be  registered    certified   or certificated by private organizations 
There are two major national organizations that offer professional certification to paralegals who meet voluntary regulation standards  the National Association of Legal Assistants  NALA  established in                  and the National Federation of Paralegal Associations  NFPA  established in                  
Both NALA and the NFPA offer professional certification exams that should not be confused with a paralegal certificate offered by an officially accredited college or university 
NALA offers its Certified Legal Assistant or Certified Paralegal examination  a comprehensive two day examination that covers the following subjects  Communications  Ethics  Legal Research  Judgment and Analytical Ability  American Legal System and four sub sections selected by the applicants from a list of nine substantive areas of the law  These sub section tests cover general knowledge of the following practice areas  Administrative Law  Bankruptcy  Business Organizations  Civil Litigation  Contracts  Criminal Law and Procedure  Estate  Planning and Probate  Family Law and Real Estate  After successful completion of the examination  NALA awards the paralegal the  CLA   Certified Legal Assistant  or  CP   Certified Paralegal  designation  Both the  CLA  and  CP  designations are proprietary trademarks owned by NALA  Paralegals who have attained further education and received a paralegal certificate are referred to as  Certificated  unless they have passed the examination and have been awarded the  Certified  designation  Additionally  those paralegals who receive the  Certified Paralegal  designation then have the opportunity to earn the  Advanced Certified Paralegal  designation  There is a    to    percent pass rate for persons taking the NALA exams             
The NFPA offers its non accredited Paralegal Advanced Competency Exam  which is a four hour exam on a variety of legal topics  those who pass that exam can call themselves PACE Registered Paralegals and display the  RP  designation               NFPA s core purpose is to advance the paralegal profession and is committed to the profession s Code of Ethics 
Some states have considered the licensure of paralegals   Whether paralegals should be licensed or certified is one of the most important issues for paralegals today      citation needed     

Difference from lawyers edit 
The greatest differences between lawyers and paralegals are that lawyers give legal advice  can set fees  appear as counsel of record in court  and sign pleadings  and other court documents  in a representative capacity  A paralegal who attempts to do any of these acts will be in violation of the unauthorized practice of law statutes in most U S  states  Paralegals are responsible for handling tasks such as legal writing  research  and other forms of documentation for the lawyers for whom they work 

Penalties for unauthorized practice edit 
Paralegals are restrained from exercising independence and prohibited from providing even basic legal advice to consumers of legal advice  In her book  Access to Justice  Stanford law professor Deborah Rhode states   Over four fifths of surveyed attorneys have supported prosecution of lay practitioners  and the profession has repeatedly blocked licensing proposals that would enable independent paralegals to offer routine services  Many local  state and national bar associations have recently launched initiatives to broaden the definition  raise the penalties  and increase the enforcement of unauthorized practice prohibitions              
In some areas  legal document assistants actually advertise themselves as paralegals  Many states  including Florida  have enacted laws or bar rules which require any person referring to himself or herself as a paralegal to work under the supervision of a licensed attorney              This rule would prohibit those individuals working as  independent paralegals  from using the title  paralegal  

Salary edit 
In the United States  as of May       the median annual salary for a paralegal was US         Paralegals working for the U S  federal government average around         per year while state and local government paralegals earn around         to                     

History edit 
Paralegals have been used in the United States for almost    years      citation needed

Several state governments have designated a  Paralegal Day   which is not the same day everywhere  in particular New York s governor David Paterson                                      Michigan s governor Jennifer M  Granholm              South Carolina  Idaho s governor James E  Risch             and the Texas Legislature             have designated Paralegal Day in their respective states  California  Connecticut  Ohio              Commonwealth of Pennsylvania             and Utah also have a Paralegal Day                                     

Paralegal service or document preparers edit 
There are a variety of services available to the general public depending on the State of residence  These companies have been known as Paralegal Services until they were required to change their names   These companies are now typically known to the general public as Court Document Preparers or Court Forms Providers   The State of Florida has numerous companies that prepare court documents for a variety of issues  such as Divorce  Bankruptcy  Paternity  Custody  Modification of Child Support  Name Change  Wills  Power of Attorney  Quit Claim Deeds  etc   If you do not have the ability to remedy your situation because of the high cost fees of any attorney a Court Document Preparer can save thousands of dollars   Such document preparers  however  frequently come under the scrutiny of various state bar organizations by overstepping the basic document preparation and engaging in what could be considered  unauthorized practice of law    Such document preparation is indeed cost saving for those who truly want to represent themselves in a legal matter  but want to pay someone to create the required documents   If problems arise in the legal case  however  the person who hired the paralegal service needs to understand that there is typically no legal liability on the part of the paralegal service and that such institutions cannot be sued for legal malpractice   Again  the philosophy is that the person utilizing such service is representing himself or herself in all legal matters and merely hiring a document preparer 

California edit 
As of       California  is the only state in the nation that comprehensively regulates the paralegal profession              
In California  under Business and Professions Code              a paralegal must have at least one of the following 

An ABA approved paralegal certificate 
A certificate of completion of a paralegal program at  or a degree from  a post secondary institution that requires the successful completion of a minimum of    semester  or equivalent  units in law related courses and that has been accredited by a national or regional accrediting organization or approved by the Bureau for Private Post secondary and Vocational Education 
A bachelor s degree or advanced degree in any subject and at least one year of experience performing legal tasks under the supervision of an attorney that has at least three years  legal experience in California himself   The attorney must sign a written declaration stating the paralegal is qualified to perform legal tasks 
Before December           have completed a high school diploma or general equivalency diploma and a minimum of three years of law related experience under the supervision of an attorney that has at least three years  legal experience in California himself   The attorney must sign a written declaration stating the paralegal is qualified to perform legal tasks             
Up until Business and Professions Code             was signed into law by Governor Gray Davis in       there was little regulation of paralegals in California  One of the purposes of regulation under Business and Professions Code             was to shut down the paralegals who were providing self help legal services to consumers      citation needed      There had been relatively few consumer complaints against paralegals  instead most of the complaints were from lawyers who urged the California State Bar to police the unauthorized practice of law  UPL       citation needed     
In response  the State Bar appointed a Public Protection Committee to look at the L A  bar s claim   Then   in       the Public Protection Committee unanimously recommended that the California legislature completely abolish the state s UPL laws  It further concluded that independent paralegals should be allowed to provide all types of legal services as long as they are registered with a state agency and disclose their non lawyer status to all customers   After many local bar associations reacted in dismay   The California Bar then appointed a third group  The Commission on Legal Technicians  to restudy the issue  This commission largely agreed with the conclusions of its predecessors and recommended that non lawyers be authorized by the California Supreme Court to deliver legal services in several major areas  bankruptcy  family  immigration  and landlord tenant   under the terms of a licensing scheme that would be supervised by an independent state agency              
This development culminated in some paralegals being forced to give up the title paralegal for Legal Document Assistant  LDA  in order to administer legal services directly to the public in the allowed areas under California Bus  amp  Prof  Code              Paralegals who are members of professional associations are also bound by those associations  codes of ethics many of which include sections prescribing that members not offer legal services directly to the public without the supervision of an attorney or law firm
