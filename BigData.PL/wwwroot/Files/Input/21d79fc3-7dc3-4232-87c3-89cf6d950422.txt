Flutter is Google s mobile SDK that builds native Android and iOS apps from a single codebase  It was developed in December       When building applications with Flutter  everything is geared towards Widgets   the blocks with which the Flutter apps are built  The User Interface of the app comprises many simple widgets  each handling one particular job  That is why developers think of their Flutter app as a tree of devices 
Compared to contemporary technologies like React Native  Kotlin  and Java  Flutter is much better regarding having a Single Codebase for Android and iOS  Reusable UI and Business Logic  high compatibility  performance  and productivity 
Prerequisite
Before diving into Flutter  it is important to have a strong grasp of Dart programming  familiarity with Android Studio  and knowledge of web scripting languages like HTML  JavaScript  and CSS
