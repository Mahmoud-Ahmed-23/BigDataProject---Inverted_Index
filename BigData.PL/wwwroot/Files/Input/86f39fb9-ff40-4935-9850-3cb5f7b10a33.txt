Hans Peter Moravec  born November           Kautzen  Austria  is computer scientist and an adjunct faculty member at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh  USA  He is known for his work on robotics  artificial intelligence  and writings on the impact of technology  Moravec also is a futurist with many of his publications and predictions focusing on transhumanism  Moravec developed techniques in computer vision for determining the region of interest  ROI  in a scene 


Career edit 
Moravec attended Loyola College in Montreal for two years and transferred to Acadia University  where he received his BSc in mathematics in       He received his MSc in computer science in      from the University of Western Ontario  He then earned a PhD in computer science from Stanford University in      for a TV equipped robot which was remotely controlled by a large computer  the Stanford Cart              The robot was able to negotiate cluttered obstacle courses  Another achievement in robotics was the discovery of new approaches for robot spatial representation such as  D occupancy grids  He also developed the idea of bush robots 
Moravec joined the newly established Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon in      as a research scientist  becoming research professor in       He has been an adjunct professor at the institute since                 
Moravec was a cofounder of Seegrid Corporation            of Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania             in       which is a robotics company with one of its goals being to develop a fully autonomous robot capable of navigating its environment without human intervention 
He is also somewhat known for his work on space tethers            

Futurism edit 
Predictions edit 
Hans Moravec has made some concrete predictions as to the future of intelligence  by estimating the computational cost  measured in instructions per second  of various operations of human intelligence  and comparing it with the future of computer computational power as predicted by Moore s law 
In When will computer hardware match the human brain                    he estimated that human brains operate at about

 instructions per second  and that  if Moore s law continues  a computer with the same speed would cost only      USD       dollars  in mid     s  thus  computers suitable for humanlike robots will appear in the     s  

Mind Children edit 
In his      book Mind Children             Moravec outlines Moore s law and predictions about the future of artificial life  Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario in this regard                        in that the robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species  starting around                       
Moravec also outlined the  neural substitution argument  in Mind Children                                       published   years before David Chalmers published a similar argument in his paper  Absent Qualia  Fading Qualia  Dancing Qualia   which is sometimes cited as the source of the idea  The neural substitution argument is that if each neuron in a conscious brain can be replaced successively by an electronic substitute with the same behavior as the neuron it replaces  then a biological consciousness would be transferred seamlessly into an electronic computer  thus proving that consciousness does not depend on biology and can be treated as an abstract computable process 

Robot  Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind edit 
In Robot  Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind  published in       Moravec further considers the implications of evolving robot intelligence  generalizing Moore s law to technologies predating the integrated circuit  and extrapolating it to predict a coming  mind fire  of rapidly expanding superintelligence 
Arthur C  Clarke wrote about this book   Robot is the most awesome work of controlled imagination I have ever encountered  Hans Moravec stretched my mind until it hit the stops               David Brin also praised the book   Moravec blends hard scientific practicality with a prophet s far seeing vision               On the other hand  the book was reviewed less favorably by Colin McGinn for The New York Times  McGinn wrote   Moravec     writes bizarre  confused  incomprehensible things about consciousness as an abstraction  like number  and as a mere  interpretation  of brain activity  He also loses his grip on the distinction between virtual and real reality as his speculations spiral majestically into incoherence
