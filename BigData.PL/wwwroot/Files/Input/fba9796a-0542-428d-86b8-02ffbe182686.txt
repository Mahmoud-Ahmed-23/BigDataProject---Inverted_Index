Machine reading of unstructured documents
Information extraction  IE  is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and or semi structured machine readable documents and other electronically represented sources  Typically  this involves processing human language texts by means of natural language processing  NLP              Recent activities in multimedia document processing like automatic annotation and content extraction out of images audio video documents could be seen as information extraction 
Recent advances in NLP techniques have allowed for significantly improved performance compared to previous years             An example is the extraction from newswire reports of corporate mergers  such as denoted by the formal relation

from an online news sentence such as 

 Yesterday  New York based Foo Inc  announced their acquisition of Bar Corp  
A broad goal of IE is to allow computation to be done on the previously unstructured data   A more specific goal is to allow automated reasoning about the logical form of the input data   Structured data is semantically well defined data from a chosen target domain  interpreted with respect to category and context 
Information extraction is the part of a greater puzzle which deals with the problem of devising automatic methods for text management  beyond its transmission  storage and display  The discipline of information retrieval  IR             has developed automatic methods  typically of a statistical flavor  for indexing large document collections and classifying documents  Another complementary approach is that of natural language processing  NLP  which has solved the problem of modelling human language processing with considerable success when taking into account the magnitude of the task  In terms of both difficulty and emphasis   IE deals with tasks in between both IR and NLP  In terms of input  IE assumes the existence of a set of documents in which each document follows a template  i e  describes one or more entities or events  in a manner that is similar to those in other documents but differing in the details  An example  consider a group of newswire articles on Latin American terrorism with each article presumed to be based upon one or more terroristic acts  We also define for any given IE task a template  which is a or a set of  case frame s  to hold the information contained in a single document  For the terrorism example  a template would have slots corresponding to the perpetrator  victim  and weapon of the terroristic act  and the date on which the event happened  An IE system for this problem is required to  understand  an attack article only enough to find data corresponding to the slots in this template 


History edit 
Information extraction dates back to the late     s in the early days of NLP             An early commercial system from the mid     s was JASPER built for Reuters by the Carnegie Group Inc with the aim of providing real time financial news to financial traders            
Beginning in       IE was spurred by a series of Message Understanding Conferences  MUC is a competition based conference            that focused on the following domains  

MUC           MUC           Naval operations messages 
MUC           MUC           Terrorism in Latin American countries 
MUC           Joint ventures and microelectronics domain 
MUC           News articles on management changes 
MUC           Satellite launch reports 
Considerable support came from the U S  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA   who wished to automate mundane tasks performed by government analysts  such as scanning newspapers for possible links to terrorism      citation needed     

Present significance edit 
The present significance of IE pertains to the growing amount of information available in unstructured form  Tim Berners Lee  inventor of the World Wide Web  refers to the existing Internet as the web of documents             and advocates that more of the content be made available as a web of data              Until this transpires  the web largely consists of unstructured documents lacking semantic metadata   Knowledge contained within these documents can be made more accessible for machine processing by means of transformation into relational form  or by marking up with XML tags   An intelligent agent monitoring a news data feed requires IE to transform unstructured data into something that can be reasoned with   A typical application of IE is to scan a set of documents written in a natural language and populate a database with the information extracted            

Tasks and subtasks edit 
Applying information extraction to text is linked to the problem of text simplification in order to create a structured view of the information present in free text  The overall goal being to create a more easily machine readable text to process the sentences  Typical IE tasks and subtasks include 

Template filling  Extracting a fixed set of fields from a document  e g  extract perpetrators  victims  time  etc  from a newspaper article about a terrorist attack 
Event extraction  Given an input document  output zero or more event templates  For instance  a newspaper article might describe multiple terrorist attacks 
Knowledge Base Population  Fill a database of facts given a set of documents  Typically the database is in the form of triplets   entity    relation  entity     e g   Barack Obama  Spouse  Michelle Obama 
Named entity recognition  recognition of known entity names  for people and organizations   place names  temporal expressions  and certain types of numerical expressions  by employing existing knowledge of the domain or information extracted from other sentences              Typically the recognition task involves assigning a unique identifier to the extracted entity  A simpler task is named entity detection  which aims at detecting entities without having any existing knowledge about the entity instances  For example  in processing the sentence  M  Smith likes fishing   named entity detection would denote detecting that the phrase  M  Smith  does refer to a person  but without necessarily having  or using  any knowledge about a certain M  Smith who is  or   might be   the specific person whom that sentence is talking about 
Coreference resolution  detection of coreference and anaphoric links between text entities  In IE tasks  this is typically restricted to finding links between previously extracted named entities  For example   International Business Machines  and  IBM  refer to the same real world entity  If we take the two sentences  M  Smith likes fishing  But he doesn t like biking   it would be beneficial to detect that  he  is referring to the previously detected person  M  Smith  
Relationship extraction  identification of relations between entities              such as 
PERSON works for ORGANIZATION  extracted from the sentence  Bill works for IBM   
PERSON located in LOCATION  extracted from the sentence  Bill is in France   
Semi structured information extraction which may refer to any IE that tries to restore some kind of information structure that has been lost through publication  such as 
Table extraction  finding and extracting tables from documents                         
Table information extraction        extracting information in structured manner from the tables  This task is more complex than table extraction  as table extraction is only the first step  while understanding the roles of the cells  rows  columns  linking the information inside the table and understanding the information presented in the table are additional tasks necessary for table information extraction                                     
Comments extraction        extracting comments from the actual content of articles in order to restore the link between authors of each of the sentences
Language and vocabulary analysis
Terminology extraction  finding the relevant terms for a given corpus
Audio extraction
Template based music extraction  finding relevant characteristic in an audio signal taken from a given repertoire  for instance              time indexes of occurrences of percussive sounds can be extracted in order to represent the essential rhythmic component of a music piece 
Note that this list is not exhaustive and that the exact meaning of IE activities is not commonly accepted and that many approaches combine multiple sub tasks of IE in order to achieve a wider goal  Machine learning  statistical analysis and or natural language processing are often used in IE 
IE on non text documents is becoming an increasingly interesting topic     when       in research  and information extracted from multimedia documents can now     when       be expressed in a high level structure as it is done on text  This naturally leads to the fusion of extracted information from multiple kinds of documents and sources 

World Wide Web applications edit 
IE has been the focus of the MUC conferences  The proliferation of the Web  however  intensified the need for developing IE systems that help people to cope with the enormous amount of data that are available online  Systems that perform IE from online text should meet the requirements of low cost  flexibility in development and easy adaptation to new domains  MUC systems fail to meet those criteria  Moreover  linguistic analysis performed for unstructured text does not exploit the HTML XML tags and the layout formats that are available in online texts  As a result  less linguistically intensive approaches have been developed for IE on the Web using wrappers  which are sets of highly accurate rules that extract a particular page s content  Manually developing wrappers has proved to be a time consuming task  requiring a high level of expertise  Machine learning techniques  either supervised or unsupervised  have been used to induce such rules automatically 
Wrappers typically handle highly structured collections of web pages  such as product catalogs and telephone directories  They fail  however  when the text type is less structured  which is also common on the Web  Recent effort on adaptive information extraction motivates the development of IE systems that can handle different types of text  from well structured to almost free text  where common wrappers fail  including mixed types  Such systems can exploit shallow natural language knowledge and thus can be also applied to less structured texts 
A recent     when       development is Visual Information Extraction                          that relies on rendering a webpage in a browser and creating rules based on the proximity of regions in the rendered web page  This helps in extracting entities from complex web pages that may exhibit a visual pattern  but lack a discernible pattern in the HTML source code 

Approaches edit 
The following standard approaches are now widely accepted 

Hand written regular expressions  or nested group of regular expressions 
Using classifiers
Generative  na ve Bayes classifier
Discriminative  maximum entropy models such as Multinomial logistic regression
Sequence models
Recurrent neural network
Hidden Markov model
Conditional Markov model  CMM    Maximum entropy Markov model  MEMM 
Conditional random fields  CRF  are commonly used in conjunction with IE for tasks as varied as extracting information from research papers             to extracting navigation instructions             
Numerous other approaches exist for IE including hybrid approaches that combine some of the standard approaches previously listed
