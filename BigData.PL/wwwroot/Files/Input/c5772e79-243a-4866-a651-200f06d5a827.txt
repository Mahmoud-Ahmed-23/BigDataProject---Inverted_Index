Corporate culture
During his tenure  Jeff Bezos had become renowned for his annual shareholder letters  which have gained similar notability to those of Warren Buffett               These annual letters gave an  invaluable window  into the famously  secretive  company  and revealed Bezos s perspectives and strategic focus                            A common theme of these letters is Bezos s desire to instill customer centricity  in his words   customer obsession   at all levels of Amazon  notably by making all senior executives field customer support queries for a short time at Amazon call centers  He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address               One of Bezos s most well known internal memos was his mandate for  all teams  to  expose their data and functionality  through service interfaces  designed from the ground up to be externalizable   This process  commonly known as a service oriented architecture  SOA   resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS      citation needed
