                                  How YouTube recommends videos using  the
                                  algorithm 
                                
                              
                            
                          

                          
                            
                              Our search and discovery systems are built to find
                              videos that match viewers  individual interests 
                              We
                              recommend videos
                              based on things such as  what your audience
                              watches and doesn t watch  how much time they
                              spend watching  what they like and dislike  if
                              they mark a video as  not interested   and on
                              satisfaction surveys 
                            
                            
                              So  rather than trying trying to find a secret
                              code to these systems  focus instead on making
                              videos that you think will resonate with your
                              audience  A great tool here is YouTube Analytics 
                              which provides data that can help you understand
                              how your existing content is performing and

                            keep in mind 
                          
                          
                            With each video  think carefully about the title 
                            description  and
                            thumbnail

                            reflect your content and let viewers know what they
                            can expect from the video  If you re a Shorts
                            creator  think about how the first     seconds of

                            their attention via hashtags 
                            playlists 
                            cards 
                            end screens  and more

                            Our search and discovery systems are built to find
                            videos that match viewers  individual interests  We
                            recommend videos
                            based on things such as  what your audience watches
                            and doesn t watch  how much time they spend
                            watching  what they like and dislike  if they mark a
                            video as  not interested   and on satisfaction
                            surveys 
                          
                          
                            So  rather than trying trying to find a secret code
                            to these systems  focus instead on making videos
                            that you think will resonate with your audience  A
