Type of non monotonic logic
Default logic is a non monotonic logic proposed by Raymond Reiter to formalize reasoning with default assumptions 
Default logic can express facts like  by default  something is true   by contrast  standard logic can only express that something is true or that something is false  This is a problem because reasoning often involves facts that are true in the majority of cases but not always  A classical example is   birds typically fly   This rule can be expressed in standard logic either by  all birds fly   which is inconsistent with the fact that penguins do not fly  or by  all birds that are not penguins and not ostriches and     fly   which requires all exceptions to the rule to be specified  Default logic aims at formalizing inference rules like this one without explicitly mentioning all their exceptions 


Syntax of default logic edit 
A default theory is a pair 
  
    
      
          x  e  
        W
         
        D
          x  e  
      
    
      displaystyle  langle W D rangle  
  
  W is a set of logical formulas  called the background theory  that formalize the facts that are known for sure  D is a set of default rules  each one being of the form

 is consistent with our current beliefs  we are led to believe that Conclusion is true 
The logical formulae in W and all formulae in a default were originally assumed to be first order logic formulae  but they can potentially be formulae in an arbitrary formal logic  The case in which they are formulae in propositional logic is one of the most studied 

Examples edit 
The default rule  birds typically fly  is formalized by the following default 


  
    
      
        D
         
        
           
          
            
              
                
                  B
                  i
                  r
                  d
                
                 
                X
                 
                 
                
                  F
                  l
                  i
                  e
                  s
                
                 
                X
                 
              
              
                
                  F
                  l
                  i
                  e
                  s
                
                 
                X
                 
              
            
          
           
        
      
    
      displaystyle D  left    frac   mathrm  Bird   X   mathrm  Flies   X    mathrm  Flies   X    right   
  

This rule means that   if X is a bird  and it can be assumed that it flies  then we can conclude that it flies   A background theory containing some facts about birds is the following one 


  
    
      
        W

          n
        
         
         
          xac 
        
          F
          l
          i
          e
          s
        
         
        
          P
          e
          n
          g
          u
          i
          n

      displaystyle W    mathrm  Bird    mathrm  Condor     mathrm  Bird    mathrm  Penguin     neg  mathrm  Flies    mathrm  Penguin     mathrm  Flies    mathrm  Bee      
  
 
According to this default rule  a condor flies because the precondition Bird Condor  is true and the justification Flies Condor  is not inconsistent with what is currently known  On the contrary  Bird Penguin  does not allow concluding Flies Penguin   even if the precondition of the default Bird Penguin  is true  the justification Flies Penguin  is inconsistent with what is known  From this background theory and this default  Bird Bee  cannot be concluded because the default rule only allows deriving Flies X  from Bird X   but not vice versa  Deriving the antecedents of an inference rule from the consequences is a form of explanation of the consequences  and is the aim of abductive reasoning 
A common default assumption is that what is not known to be true is believed to be false  This is known as the Closed World Assumption  and is formalized in default logic using a default like the following one for every fact F 


  
    
      
        
          
            
               
              
                  xac 
              
              F
            
            
              
                  xac 
              
              F
            
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   frac     neg  F    neg  F   
  

For example  the computer language Prolog uses a sort of default assumption when dealing with negation  if a negative atom cannot be proved to be true  then it is assumed to be false 
Note  however  that Prolog uses the so called negation as failure  when the interpreter has to evaluate the atom 
  
    
      
          xac 
        F
      
    
      displaystyle  neg F 
  
  it tries to prove that F is true  and conclude that 
  
    
      
          xac 
        F
      
    
      displaystyle  neg F 
  
 is true if it fails  In default logic  instead  a default having 
  
    
      
          xac 
        F
      
    
      displaystyle  neg F 
  
 as a justification can only be applied if 
  
    
      
          xac 
        F
      
    
      displaystyle  neg F 
  
 is consistent with the current knowledge 

Restrictions edit 
A default is categorical or prerequisite free if it has no prerequisite  or  equivalently  its prerequisite is tautological   A default is normal if it has a single justification that is equivalent to its conclusion  A default is supernormal if it is both categorical and normal  A default is seminormal if all its justifications entail its conclusion  A default theory is called categorical  normal  supernormal  or seminormal if all defaults it contains are categorical  normal  supernormal  or seminormal  respectively 

Semantics of default logic edit 
A default rule can be applied to a theory if its precondition is entailed by the theory and its justifications are all consistent with the theory   The application of a default rule leads to the addition of its consequence to the theory   Other default rules may then be applied to the resulting theory   When the theory is such that no other default can be applied  the theory is called an extension of the default theory   The default rules may be applied in different order  and this may lead to different extensions  The Nixon diamond example is a default theory with two extensions

Since Nixon is both a Republican and a Quaker  both defaults can be applied  However  applying the first default leads to the conclusion that Nixon is not a pacifist  which makes the second default not applicable  In the same way  applying the second default we obtain that Nixon is a pacifist  thus making the first default not applicable  This particular default theory has therefore two extensions  one in which Pacifist Nixon  is true  and one in which Pacifist Nixon  is false 
The original semantics of default logic was based on the fixed point of a function  The following is an equivalent algorithmic definition  If a default contains formulae with free variables  it is considered to represent the set of all defaults obtained by giving a value to all these variables  A default 
  
    
      
        
          
            
                x b  
               
              
                  x b  
                
                   
                
              
               
                x     
               
              
                  x b  
                
                  n
                
              
            
              x b  
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   frac   alpha   beta       ldots   beta   n    gamma    
  
 is applicable to a propositional theory T if 
  
    
      
        T
          x  a  
          x b  
      
    
      displaystyle T models  alpha  
  
 and all theories 
  
    
      
        T
          x   a 
         
        
            x b  
          
            i
          
        
         
      
    
      displaystyle T cup    beta   i    
  
 are consistent  The application of this default to T leads to the theory 
  
    
      
        T
          x   a 
         
          x b  
         
      
    
      displaystyle T cup    gamma    
  
  An extension can be generated by applying the following algorithm 

T   W            current theory   
A                set of defaults applied so far   
      
                 apply a sequence of defaults   
while there is a default d that is not in A and is applicable to T
    add the consequence of d to T
    add d to A
      
                 final consistency check   
if 
    for every default d in A
        T is consistent with all justifications of d
then
    output T

This algorithm is non deterministic  as several defaults can alternatively be applied to a given theory T  In the Nixon diamond example  the application of the first default leads to a theory to which the second default cannot be applied and vice versa  As a result  two extensions are generated  one in which Nixon is a pacifist and one in which Nixon is not a pacifist 
The final check of consistency of the justifications of all defaults that have been applied implies that some theories do not have any extensions  In particular  this happens whenever this check fails for every possible sequence of applicable defaults  The following default theory has no extension 


  
    
      
        
            x  e  
          
            
               
              
                
                  
                     
                    A
                     
                    b
                     
                  
                  
                      xac 
                    A
                     
                    b
                     
                  
                
              
               
            
             
              x     
          
            x  e  
        
      
    
      displaystyle  left langle  left    frac   A b    neg A b    right    emptyset  right rangle  
  

Since 
  
    
      
        A
         
        b
         
      
    
      displaystyle A b  
  
 is consistent with the background theory  the default can be applied  thus leading to the conclusion that 
  
    
      
        A
         
        b
         
      
    
      displaystyle A b  
  
 is false  This result however undermines the assumption that has been made for applying the first default  Consequently  this theory has no extensions 
In a normal default theory  all defaults are normal  each default has the form 
  
    
      
        
          
            
                x d  
               
                x c  
            
              x c  
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle   frac   phi   psi    psi    
  
  A normal default theory is guaranteed to have at least one extension  Furthermore  the extensions of a normal default theory are mutually inconsistent  i e   inconsistent with each other 

Entailment edit 
A default theory can have zero  one  or more extensions  Entailment of a formula from a default theory can be defined in two ways 

Skeptical
a formula is entailed by a default theory if it is entailed by all its extensions 
Credulous
a formula is entailed by a default theory if it is entailed by at least one of its extensions 
Thus  the Nixon diamond example theory has two extensions  one in which Nixon is a pacifist and one in which he is not a pacifist  Consequently  neither Pacifist Nixon  nor       Pacifist Nixon  are skeptically entailed  while both of them are credulously entailed  As this example shows  the credulous consequences of a default theory may be inconsistent with each other 

Alternative default inference rules edit 
The following alternative inference rules for default logic are all based on the same syntax as the original system 

Justified
differs from the original one in that a default is not applied if thereby the set T becomes inconsistent with a justification of an applied default 
Concise
a default is applied only if its consequence is not already entailed by T  the exact definition is more complicated than this one  this is only the main idea behind it  
Constrained
a default is applied only if the set composed of the background theory  the justifications of all applied defaults  and the consequences of all applied defaults  including this one  is consistent 
Rational
similar to constrained default logic  but the consequence of the default to add is not considered in the consistency check 
Cautious
defaults that can be applied but are conflicting with each other  like the ones of the Nixon diamond example  are not applied 
The justified and constrained versions of the inference rule assign at least an extension to every default theory 

Variants of default logic edit 
The following variants of default logic differ from the original one on both syntax and semantics 

Assertional variants
An assertion is a pair 
  
    
      
          x  e  
        p
         
         
        
          r
          
             
          
        
         
          x     
         
        
          r
          
            n
          
        
         
          x  e  
      
    
      displaystyle  langle p   r      ldots  r  n    rangle  
  
 composed of a formula and a set of formulae  Such a pair indicates that p is true while the formulae 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
             
          
        
         
          x     
         
        
          r
          
            n
          
        
      
    
      displaystyle r      ldots  r  n  
  
 have been assumed consistent to prove that p is true  An assertional default theory is composed of an assertional theory  a set of assertional formulae  called the background theory and a set of defaults defined as in the original syntax  Whenever a default is applied to an assertional theory  the pair composed of its consequence and its set of justifications is added to the theory  The following semantics use assertional theories 
Cumulative default logic
Commitment to assumptions default logic
Quasi default logic
Weak extensions
rather than checking whether the preconditions are valid in the theory composed of the background theory and the consequences of the applied defaults  the preconditions are checked for validity in the extension that will be generated  in other words  the algorithm for generating extensions starts by guessing a theory and using it in place of the background theory  what results from the process of extension generation is actually an extension only if it is equivalent to the theory guessed at the beginning  This variant of default logic is related in principle to autoepistemic logic  where a theory 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
        x
          x     
        x
      
    
      displaystyle  Box x rightarrow x 
  
 has the model in which x is true just because  assuming 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
        x
      
    
      displaystyle  Box x 
  
 true  the formula 
  
    
      
          x  fb 
        x
          x     
        x
      
    
      displaystyle  Box x rightarrow x 
  
 supports the initial assumption 
Disjunctive default logic
the consequence of a default is a set of formulae instead of a single formula  Whenever the default is applied  at least one of its consequences is nondeterministically chosen and made true 
Priorities on defaults
the relative priority of defaults can be explicitly specified  among the defaults that are applicable to a theory  only one of the most preferred ones can be applied  Some semantics of default logic do not require priorities to be explicitly specified  rather  more specific defaults  those that are applicable in fewer cases  are preferred over less specific ones 
Statistical variant
a statistical default is a default with an attached upper bound on its frequency of error  in other words  the default is assumed to be an incorrect inference rule in at most that fraction of times it is applied 
Translations edit 
Default theories can be translated into theories in other logics and vice versa  The following conditions on translations have been considered 

Consequence Preserving
the original and the translated theories have the same  propositional  consequences 
Faithful
this condition only makes sense when translating between two variants of default logic or between default logic and a logic in which a concept similar to extension exists  e g   models in modal logic  a translation is faithful if there exists a mapping  typically  a bijection  between the extensions  or models  of the original and translated theories 
Modular
a translation from default logic to another logic is modular if the defaults and the background theory can be translated separately  moreover  the addition of formulae to the background theory only leads to adding the new formulae to the result of the translation 
Same Alphabet
the original and translated theories are built on the same alphabet 
Polynomial
the running time of the translation or the size of the generated theory are required to be polynomial in the size of the original theory 
Translations are typically required to be faithful or at
least consequence preserving  while the conditions of
modularity and same alphabet are sometimes ignored 
The translatability between propositional default logic and
the following logics have been studied 

classical propositional logic 
autoepistemic logic 
propositional default logic restricted to seminormal theories 
alternative semantics of default logic 
circumscription 
Translations exist or not depending on which conditions are imposed  Translations from propositional default logic to classical propositional logic cannot always generate a polynomially sized propositional theory  unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses  Translations to autoepistemic logic exist or not depending on whether modularity or the use of the same alphabet is required
