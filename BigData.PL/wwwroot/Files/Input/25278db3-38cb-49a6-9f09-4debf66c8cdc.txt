Totality of psychological phenomena
For other uses  see Mind  disambiguation  



The mind is responsible for phenomena like perception  thought  feeling  and action 
The mind is that which thinks  feels  perceives  imagines  remembers  and wills  It covers the totality of mental phenomena  including both conscious processes  through which an individual is aware of external and internal circumstances  and unconscious processes  which can influence an individual without intention or awareness  The mind plays a central role in most aspects of human life  but its exact nature is disputed  Some characterizations focus on internal aspects  saying that the mind transforms information and is not directly accessible to outside observers  Others stress its relation to outward conduct  understanding mental phenomena as dispositions to engage in observable behavior 
The mind body problem is the challenge of explaining the relation between matter and mind  Traditionally  mind and matter were often thought of as distinct substances that could exist independently from one another  The dominant philosophical position since the   th century has been physicalism  which says that everything is material  meaning that minds are certain aspects or features of some material objects  The evolutionary history of the mind is tied to the development of nervous systems  which led to the formation of brains  As brains became more complex  the number and capacity of mental functions increased with particular brain areas dedicated to specific mental functions  Individual human minds also develop over time as they learn from experience and pass through psychological stages in the process of aging  Some people are affected by mental disorders  in which certain mental capacities do not function as they should 
It is widely accepted that at least some non human animals have some form of mind  but it is controversial to which animals this applies  The topic of artificial minds poses similar challenges and theorists discuss the possibility and consequences of creating them using computers 
The main fields of inquiry studying the mind include psychology  neuroscience  cognitive science  and philosophy of mind  They tend to focus on different aspects of the mind and employ different methods of investigation  ranging from empirical observation and neuroimaging to conceptual analysis and thought experiments  The mind is relevant to many other fields  including epistemology  anthropology  religion  and education 


Definition edit 
The mind is the totality of psychological phenomena and capacities  encompassing both conscious and unconscious states  The term mind is sometimes used in a narrow meaning to refer only to cognitive functions associated with perception  reasoning  awareness  and memory  In a broader sense  it also includes processes like feeling  motivation  and behavior             The precise definition of mind is disputed and while it is generally accepted that some non human animals also have minds  there is no agreement on where exactly the boundary lies             Despite these disputes  there is wide agreement that mind plays a central role in most aspects of human life as the seat of consciousness  emotions  thoughts  and sense of personal identity             Various fields of inquiry study the mind  the main ones include psychology  cognitive science  neuroscience  and philosophy of mind            
The words psyche and mentality are usually used as synonyms of mind             They are often employed in overlapping ways with the terms soul  spirit  cognition  intellect  intelligence  and brain  but their meanings are not exactly the same  Some religions understand the soul as an independent entity that constitutes the immaterial essence of human beings  is of divine origin  survives bodily death  and is immortal             The word spirit has various additional meanings not directly associated with mind  such as a vital principle animating living beings or a supernatural being inhabiting objects or places             Cognition encompasses certain types of mental processes in which knowledge is acquired and information processed             The intellect is one mental capacity responsible for thought  reasoning  and understanding            and is closely related to intelligence as the ability to acquire  understand  and apply knowledge              The brain is the physical organ responsible for most or all mental functions             
The modern English word mind originates from the Old English word gemynd  meaning  memory   This term gave rise to the Middle English words mind e   m nd e   and mend e   resulting in a slow expansion of meaning to cover all mental capacities  The original meaning is preserved in expressions like call to mind and keep in mind  Cognates include the Old High German gimunt  the Gothic gamunds  the ancient Greek        the Latin mens  and the Sanskrit manas                  a     

Forms edit 
The mind encompasses many phenomena  including perception  memory  thought  imagination  motivation  emotion  attention  learning  and consciousness              Perception is the process of interpreting and organizing sensory information to become acquainted with the environment  This information is acquired through sense organs receptive to various types of physical stimuli  which correspond to different forms of perception  such as vision  hearing  touch  smell  and taste  The sensory information received serves as raw data that is filtered and processed to actively constitute the experience of the world and the objects within it  This complex process underlying perceptual experience is shaped by many factors  including the individual s past experiences  cultural background  beliefs  knowledge  and expectations             
Memory is the mechanism of storing and retrieving information              Episodic memory handles information about specific past events in one s life and makes this information available in the present  When a person remembers what they had for dinner yesterday  they employ episodic memory  Semantic memory handles general knowledge about the world that is not tied to any specific episodes  When a person recalls that the capital of Japan is Tokyo  they usually employ semantic memory to access this general information without remembering the specific instance when they learned it  Procedural memory is memory of how to do things  such as riding a bicycle or playing a musical instrument              Another distinction is between short term memory  which holds information for brief periods  usually with the purpose of completing specific cognitive tasks  and long term memory  which can store information for extended periods  potentially lasting a lifetime             
Thinking involves the processing of information and the manipulation of concepts and ideas  It is goal oriented and often happens in response to experiences by aiming at making sense of them  organizing their information  and deciding how to respond              Logical reasoning is a form of thinking that starts from a set of premises and aims to arrive at a conclusion supported by these premises  This is the case when deducing that  Socrates is mortal  from the premises  Socrates is a man  and  all men are mortal               Problem solving is a closely related process that consists of several steps  such as identifying a problem  developing a plan to address it  implementing the plan  and assessing whether it worked              Thinking in the form of decision making involves considering possible courses of action to assess which one is the most beneficial              As a symbolic process  thinking is deeply intertwined with language  and some theorists hold that all thought happens through the medium of language             
Imagination is a creative process of internally generating mental images  ideas  experiences  and related phenomena  Unlike perception  it does not directly depend on the stimulation of sensory organs  Similar to dreaming  these mental constructs are often derived from previous experiences but can include novel combinations and elements  Imagination happens during daydreaming and plays a key role in art and literature  Additionally  it can also be used to come up with novel solutions to real world problems             
Motivation is an internal state that propels individuals to initiate  continue  or terminate goal directed behavior  It is responsible for the formation of intentions to perform actions and affects what goals someone pursues  how much effort they invest in the activity  and how long they engage in it              Motivation is affected by emotions  which are temporary experiences of positive or negative feelings like joy or anger  They are directed at and evaluate specific events  persons  or situations  They usually come together with certain physiological and behavioral responses             
Attention is an aspect of other mental processes in which mental resources like awareness are directed towards certain features of experience and away from others  This happens when a driver focuses on traffic while ignoring billboards on the side of the road  Attention can be controlled voluntarily in the pursuit of specific goals but can also be diverted involuntarily when a strong stimulus captures a person s attention              Attention is relevant to learning  which is the ability of the mind to acquire new information and permanently modify its understanding and behavioral patterns  Individuals learn by undergoing experiences  which helps them adapt to the environment             

Conscious and unconscious edit 
Main articles  Consciousness and Unconscious mind
An influential distinction is between conscious and unconscious mental processes  Consciousness is the awareness of external and internal circumstances  It encompasses a wide variety of states  such as perception  thinking  fantasizing  dreaming  and altered states of consciousness              In the case of phenomenal consciousness  the awareness involves a direct and qualitative experience of mental phenomena  like the auditory experience of attending a concert  Access consciousness  by contrast  refers to an awareness of information that is accessible to other mental processes but not necessarily part of current experience  For example  the information stored in a memory may be accessible when drawing conclusions or guiding actions even when the person is not explicitly thinking about it             
Unconscious or nonconscious mental processes operate without the individual s awareness but can still influence mental phenomena on the level of thought  feeling  and action  Some theorists distinguish between preconscious  subconscious  and unconscious states depending on their accessibility to conscious awareness                  b      When applied to the overall state of a person rather than specific processes  the term unconscious implies that the person lacks any awareness of their environment and themselves  like during a coma              The unconscious mind plays a central role in psychoanalysis as the part of the mind that contains thoughts  memories  and desires not accessible to conscious introspection  According to Sigmund Freud  the psychological mechanism of repression keeps disturbing phenomena  like unacceptable sexual and aggressive impulses  from entering consciousness to protect the individual  Psychoanalytic theory studies symptoms caused by this process and therapeutic methods to avoid them by making the repressed thoughts accessible to conscious awareness             

Other distinctions edit 
Mental states are often divided into qualitative and propositional states  Qualitative states are experiences of sensory qualities  typically referred to as qualia  like colors  sounds  smells  pains  itches  and hunger  Propositional states involve an attitude towards a content that can be expressed by a declarative sentence  When a person believes that it is raining  they have the propositional attitude of belief towards the content  it is raining   Different types of propositional states are characterized by different attitudes towards their content  For instance  it is also possible to hope  fear  desire  or doubt that it is raining                  c     
A mental state or process is rational if it is based on good reasons or follows the norms of rationality  For example  a belief is rational if it relies on strong supporting evidence and a decision is rational if it follows careful deliberation of all the relevant factors and outcomes  Mental states are irrational if they fail to adhere to these standards  such as beliefs caused by faulty reasoning  superstition  or cognitive biases  and decisions that give into temptations against one s best judgment              Mental states that fall outside the domain of rational evaluation are arational rather than irrational  There is controversy regarding which mental phenomena lie outside this domain  suggested examples include sensory impressions  feelings  desires  and involuntary responses             
Another contrast is between dispositional and occurrent mental states  A dispositional state is a power that is not exercised  If a person believes that cats have whiskers but does not think about this fact  it is a dispositional belief  By activating the belief to consciously think about it or use it in other cognitive processes  it becomes occurrent until it is no longer actively considered or used  The great majority of a person s beliefs are dispositional most of the time             

Faculties and modules edit 
Traditionally  the mind was subdivided into mental faculties understood as capacities to perform certain functions or bring about certain processes              An influential subdivision in the history of philosophy was between the faculties of intellect and will              The intellect encompasses mental phenomena aimed at understanding the world and determining what to believe or what is true  the will is concerned with practical matters and what is good  reflected in phenomena like desire  decision making  and action              The exact number and nature of the mental faculties are disputed  More fine grained distinctions divide the intellect into the faculties of understanding and judgment or add sensibility as an additional faculty responsible for sensory impressions                  d     

In the M ller Lyer illusion  the horizontal black lines have the same length but the top line appears longer  The illusion persists even after becoming aware of it because of the automatic functioning of mental modules responsible for low level visual processing             
In contrast to the traditional view  more recent approaches analyze the mind in terms of mental modules rather than faculties              A mental module is an inborn system of the brain that automatically performs a particular function within a specific domain without conscious awareness or effort  In contrast to faculties  the concept of mental modules is normally used to provide a more limited explanation  It is typically restricted to certain low level cognitive processes without trying to explain how they are integrated into higher level processes such as conscious reasoning                  e      Many low level cognitive processes responsible for visual perception have this automatic and unconscious nature  In the case of visual illusions like the M ller Lyer illusion  the underlying processes continue their operation and the illusion persists even after a person has become aware of the illusion  indicating the mechanical and involuntary nature of the process              Other examples of mental modules concern cognitive processes responsible for language processing and facial recognition             

Theories of the nature of mind edit 
Theories of the nature of mind aim to determine what all mental states have in common  They seek to discover the  mark of the mental   that is  the criteria that distinguish mental from non mental phenomena              Epistemic criteria say that the unique feature of mental states is how people know about them  For example  if a person has a toothache  they have direct or non inferential knowledge that they are in pain  But they do not have this kind of knowledge about non mental phenomena such as the physical causes of the pain  and may have to consult external evidence through visual inspection or a visit to the dentist  Another feature commonly ascribed to mental states is that they are private  meaning that others do not have direct access to a person s mental state  As a result  external observers have to make inferences from other indicators  like the pain behavior of the person with the toothache  Some philosophers claim that knowledge of some or all mental states is infallible  for instance  that a person cannot be mistaken about whether they are in pain             
A related view asserts that all mental states are either conscious or accessible to consciousness  According to this view  when a person actively remembers the fact that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris then this state is mental because it is part of consciousness  When the person does not think about it  this belief is still considered a mental state because the person could bring it to consciousness by thinking about it  This view denies the existence of a  deep unconsciousness   that is  unconscious mental states that cannot in principle become conscious             
Another theory says that intentionality     f      is the mark of the mental  A state is intentional if it refers to or represents something  For example  if a person perceives a piano or thinks about it then the mental state is intentional because it refers to a piano  This view distinguishes between the original intentionality of mental phenomena and the derivative intentionality of some non mental phenomena  According to this view  the ability of words and pictures to refer to things derives from the fact that they can evoke mental states  In this sense  only mental states have original intentionality  whereas words and pictures have derivative intentionality since they would not refer if divorced from linguistic conventions or visual interpretations  Some philosophers disagree that all mental states are intentional  citing itches  tickles  and pains as possible exceptions             
According to behaviorism  mental states are dispositions to engage in certain publicly observable behavior as a reaction to particular external stimuli  This view implies that mental phenomena are not private internal states but are accessible to empirical observation like regular physical phenomena              Functionalism agrees that mental states do not depend on the exact internal constitution of the mind and characterizes them instead in regard to their functional role  The functional role of a mental state is the way it interacts with other phenomena  For example  pain is often caused by bodily injury and typically leads to pain behavior  like moaning  and a desire to stop the pain  As a result  injury  pain behavior  and desire are part of the functional role of pain              Computationalism  a similar theory prominent in cognitive science  defines minds in terms of cognitions and computations as information processors             
Theories under the umbrella of externalism emphasize the mind s dependency on the environment  According to this view  mental states and their contents are at least partially determined by external circumstances              For example  some forms of content externalism hold that it can depend on external circumstances whether a belief refers to one object or another              The position of embedded cognition emphasizes that mental processes happen in the context of a physical and social environments  It examines how this context shapes cognitive activity              The extended mind thesis states that external circumstances not only influence the mind but are part of it  In this sense  a diary is part of the mind by helping it store information  Similarly  an electronic calculator is part of the mind by helping it perform calculations              The closely related view of enactivism holds that mental processes involve an interaction between organism and environment              A theory from the field of embodied cognition states that the connection to a body is an essential feature of minds  It asserts that certain aspects of the body outside the nervous system  like motor capacities  are part of the mind                  g     

Relation to matter edit 
Mind body problem edit 
Main article  Mind body problem
The mind body problem is the difficulty of providing a general explanation of the relationship between mind and body  for example  of the link between thoughts and brain processes  Despite their different characteristics  mind and body interact with each other  like when a bodily change causes mental discomfort or when a limb moves because of an intention              The mind body problem came to particular prominence in modern philosophy as a result of Descartes  metaphysical distinction between mind and body  Earlier philosophers typically did not see mind and body as contrasting principles                  h      Following Descartes  philosophy  minds were often conceived as substantial entities able to exist on their own  Now they are more commonly seen as capacities rather than independent entities             

Different approaches toward resolving the mind body problem            
According to substance dualism  minds or souls exist as independent entities in addition to material things  This view implies that  at least in principle  minds can exist without bodies              Property dualism is another view  saying that mind and matter are not independent entities but different properties that apply to the same individual              Monist views  by contrast  state that reality is made up of only one kind  According to metaphysical idealists  for instance  everything is mental                  i      They understand material things as mental phenomena  for example  as ideas or perceptions              According to neutral monists  by contrast  the world is at its most fundamental level neither physical nor mental but neutral  They see physical and mental concepts as convenient but superficial ways to describe reality             
The monist view most influential since the   th century has been physicalism  also referred to as materialism      j      which states that everything is physical              According to eliminative physicalism  there are no mental phenomena  meaning that things like beliefs and desires do not form part of reality              Reductive physicalists defend a less radical position  they say that mental states exist but can  at least in principle  be completely described by physics without the need for special sciences like psychology  For example  behaviorists aim to analyze mental concepts in terms of observable behavior without resorting to internal mental states              Type identity theory also belongs to reductive physicalism and says that mental states are the same as brain states              While non reductive physicalists agree that everything is physical  they say that mental concepts describe physical reality on a more abstract level that cannot be articulated by physics              According to functionalism  mental concepts do not describe the internal constitution of physical substances but functional roles within a system              One consequence of this view is that mind does not depend on brains but can also be realized by other systems that implement the corresponding functional roles  possibly also computers              A different approach  found in the tradition of phenomenology  aims to dissolve the mind body problem by arguing that it is based on an artificial dichotomy not present in the phenomenological description of experience             
The hard problem of consciousness is a central aspect of the mind body problem  it is the challenge of explaining how physical states can give rise to conscious experience  Its main difficulty lies in the subjective and qualitative nature of consciousness  which is unlike typical physical processes  The hard problem of consciousness contrasts with the  easy problems  of explaining how certain aspects of consciousness function  such as perception  memory  or learning             

Brain areas and processes edit 
Another approach to the relation between mind and matter uses empirical observation to study how the brain works and which brain areas and processes are associated with specific mental phenomena              The brain is the central organ of the nervous system and is present in all vertebrates and the majority of invertebrates  The human brain is of particular complexity and consists of about    billion neurons  which communicate with one another via synapses              They form a complex neural network and cognitive processes emerge from their electrical and chemical interactions              The human brain is divided into regions that are associated with different functions  The main regions are the hindbrain  midbrain  and forebrain              Many biological functions associated with basic survival are the responsibility of the hindbrain and midbrain  Higher mental functions  ranging from thoughts to motivation  are primarily localized in the forebrain             

The cerebral cortex is divided into various areas with distinct functions  like the prefrontal cortex  shown in orange  responsible for executive functions             
The primary operations of many of the main mental phenomena are located in specific areas of the forebrain  The prefrontal cortex is responsible for executive functions  such as planning  decision making  problem solving  and working memory              The sensory cortex processes and interprets sensory information  with different subareas dedicated to different senses  like the visual and the auditory areas  A central function of the hippocampus is the formation and retrieval of long term memories  It belongs to the limbic system  which plays a key role in the regulation of emotions through the amygdala  The motor cortex is responsible for planning  executing  and controlling voluntary movements  Broca s area is a separate region dedicated to speech production              The activity of the different areas is additionally influenced by neurotransmitters  which are signaling molecules that enhance or inhibit different types of neural communication  For example  dopamine influences motivation and pleasure while serotonin affects mood and appetite             
The close interrelation of brain processes and the mind is seen by the effect that physical changes of the brain have on the mind  For instance  the consumption of psychoactive drugs  like caffeine  antidepressants  alcohol  and psychedelics  temporarily affects brain chemistry with diverse effects on the mind  ranging from increased attention to mood changes  impaired cognitive functions  and hallucinations              Long term changes to the brain in the form of neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries can lead to permanent alterations in mental functions  Alzheimer s disease in its first stage deteriorates the hippocampus  reducing the ability to form new memories and recall existing ones              An often cited case of the effects of brain injury is Phineas Gage  whose prefrontal cortex was severely damaged during a work accident when an iron rod pierced through his skull and brain  Gage survived the accident but his personality and social attitude changed significantly as he became more impulsive  irritable  and anti social while showing little regard for social conventions and an impaired ability to plan and make rational decisions              Not all these changes were permanent and Gage managed to recover and adapt in some areas             

Development edit 
Evolution edit 
The mind has a long evolutionary history starting with the development of the nervous system and the brain              While it is generally accepted today that mind is not exclusive to humans and various non human animals have some form of mind  there is no consensus at which point exactly the mind emerged               The evolution of mind is usually explained in terms of natural selection  genetic variations responsible for new or improved mental capacities  such as better perception or social dispositions  have an increased chance of being passed on to future generations if they are beneficial to survival and reproduction               
Minimal forms of information processing are already found in the earliest forms of life   to     billion years ago  like the abilities of bacteria and eukaryotic unicellular organisms to sense the environment  store this information  and react to it  Nerve cells emerged with the development of multicellular organisms more than     million years ago as a way to process and transmit information  About     to     million years ago  an evolutionary bifurcation happened into radially symmetric organisms     k      with ring shaped nervous systems or a nerve net  like jellyfish  and organisms with bilaterally symmetric bodies  whose nervous systems tend to be more centralized  About     million years ago  vertebrates evolved within the group of bilaterally organized organisms  Vertebrates  like birds and mammals  have a central nervous system including a complex brain with specialized functions  Invertebrates  like clams and insects  typically either have no or relatively simple brains               In the course of evolution  the brains of vertebrates tended to grow and the specialization of different brain areas tended to increase  These developments are closely related to changes in limb structures  sense organs  and living conditions with a close correspondence between the size of a brain area and the importance of its function to the organism               An important step in the evolution of mammals about     million years ago was the development of the neocortex  which is responsible for many higher order brain functions              
The size of the brain relative to the body further increased with the development of primates  like monkeys  about    million years ago and later with the emergence of the first hominins about     million years ago               Anatomically modern humans appeared about         to         years ago               Various theories of the evolutionary processes responsible for human intelligence have been proposed  The social intelligence hypothesis says that the evolution of the human mind was triggered by the increased importance of social life and its emphasis on mental abilities associated with empathy  knowledge transfer  and meta cognition  According to the ecological intelligence hypothesis  the main value of the increased mental capacities comes from their advantages in dealing with a complex physical environment through processes like behavioral flexibility  learning  and tool use  Other suggested mechanisms include the effects of a changed diet with energy rich food and general benefits from an increased speed and efficiency of information processing               Some models propose that another major cognitive shift occurred possibly        to        years ago  Called behavioral modernity  it is associated with the emergence of new or improved mental abilities  such as technological innovativeness  abstract thinking  the use of symbols  planning  and social coordination              

Individual edit 
Besides the development of mind in general in the course of history  individual human minds also develop in the course of their lifetime  Some of the individual changes vary from person to person as a form of learning from experience  like forming specific memories or acquiring particular behavioral patterns  Others are more universal developments as psychological stages that all or most humans go through as they pass through early childhood  adolescence  adulthood  and old age               These developments cover various areas  including intellectual  sensorimotor  linguistic  emotional  social  and moral developments               Some factors affect the development of mind before birth  such as nutrition  maternal stress  and exposure to harmful substances like alcohol during pregnancy              
Early childhood is marked by rapid developments as infants learn voluntary control over their bodies and interact with their environment on a basic level  Typically after about one year  this covers abilities like walking  recognizing familiar faces  and producing individual words               On the emotional and social levels  they develop attachments with their primary caretakers and express emotions ranging from joy and surprise to fear and anger               An influential theory by Jean Piaget divides the cognitive development of children into four stages  The sensorimotor stage from birth until two years is concerned with sensory impressions and motor activities while learning that objects remain in existence even when not observed  In the preoperational stage until seven years  children learn to interpret and use symbols in an intuitive manner  They start employing logical reasoning to physical objects in the concrete operational stage until eleven years and extend this capacity in the following formal operational stage to abstract ideas  probabilities  and possibilities               Other important processes shaping the mind in this period are socialization and enculturation  at first through primary caretakers and later through peers and the schooling system              
Psychological transformations during adolescence are provoked by physiological developments and by being confronted with a different social situation in the form of new expectations from others  An important factor in this period is change to the self concept  which can take the form of an identity crisis  This process typically involves developing individuality and independence from parents while at the same time seeking closeness and conformity with friends and peers  Further developments in this period include improvements to the reasoning ability and the formation of a principled moral viewpoint              
The mind also changes during adulthood but in a less rapid and pronounced manner  Reasoning and problem solving skills improve during early and middle adulthood  Some people experience the mid life transition as a midlife crisis involving an inner conflict about personal identity  associated with anxiety  a sense of a lack of accomplishments in life  or an awareness of mortality  Intellectual faculties tend to decline in later adulthood  specifically the ability to learn complex unfamiliar tasks and later also the ability to remember  At the same time  people tend to become more inward looking and cautious              

Non human edit 
Animal edit 
It is commonly acknowledged today that animals have some form of mind  but it is controversial to which animals this applies and how their mind differs from the human mind               Different conceptions of the mind lead to different responses to this problem  When understood in a very wide sense as the capacity to process information  the mind is present in all forms of life  including insects  plants  and individual cells               On the other side of the spectrum are views that deny the existence of mentality in most or all non human animals based on the idea that they lack key mental capacities  like abstract rationality and symbolic language               The status of animal minds is highly relevant to the field of ethics since it affects the treatment of animals  including the topic of animal rights              
Discontinuity views state that the minds of non human animals are fundamentally different from human minds and often point to higher mental faculties  like thinking  reasoning  and deliberate decision making               This outlook is reflected in the traditionally influential position of defining humans as  rational animals  as opposed to all other animals               Continuity views  by contrast  emphasize similarities and see cognitive differences in degree rather than kind  Central considerations for this position are the shared evolutionary origin and organic similarities on the level of the brain and nervous system  Observable behavior is another key factor  such as problem solving skills  animal communication  and reactions to and expressions of pain and pleasure  Of particular importance are the questions of consciousness and sentience  that is  to what extent non human animals have a subjective experience of the world and are capable of suffering and feeling joy              

Artificial edit 
Main article  Philosophy of artificial intelligence
Some of the difficulties of assessing animal minds are also reflected in the topic of artificial minds  It includes the question of whether computer systems implementing artificial intelligence should be considered a form of mind               This idea is consistent with some theories of the nature of mind  such as functionalism and its claim that mental concepts describe functional roles  It asserts that the functions implemented by biological brains could in principle also be implemented by artificial devices              

The Turing test aims to determine whether a computer can imitate human linguistic behavior to the degree that it is not possible to tell the difference between human and computer              
The Turing test  proposed by Alan Turing              is a traditionally influential procedure to test artificial intelligence  a person exchanges messages with two parties  one of them a human and the other a computer  The computer passes the test if it is not possible to reliably tell which party is the human and which one the computer  While there are computer programs today that may pass the Turing test  this alone is usually not accepted as conclusive proof of mindedness               For some aspects of mind  it is controversial whether computers can  in principle  implement them  such as desires  feelings  consciousness  and free will              
This problem is often discussed through the contrast between weak and strong artificial intelligence  Weak or narrow artificial intelligence is limited to specific mental capacities or functions  It focuses on a particular task or a narrow set of tasks  like autonomous driving  speech recognition  or theorem proving  The goal of strong AI  also termed artificial general intelligence  is to create a complete artificial person that has all the mental capacities of humans  including consciousness  emotion  and reason               It is controversial whether strong AI is possible  influential arguments against it include John Searle s Chinese Room Argument and Hubert Dreyfus s critique based on Heideggerian philosophy              

Mental health and disorder edit 
Main articles  Mental health  Mental disorder  and Psychopathology
Mental health is a state of mind characterized by internal equilibrium and well being in which mental capacities function as they should  Some theorists emphasize positive features such as the abilities of a person to realize their potential  express and modulate emotions  cope with adverse life situations  and fulfill their social role  Negative definitions  by contrast  see mental health as the absence of mental disorders               Mental disorders are abnormal patterns of thought  emotion  or behavior  These patterns deviate not only from how a mental capacity works on average but from how it should work while usually causing some form of distress  The content of those norms is controversial and there are differences from culture to culture  For instance  homosexuality was historically considered a mental disorder by medical professionals  a view which only changed in the second half of the   th century              

Obsessive compulsive disorder is a mental disorder in which a person follows compulsive rituals  like excessive hand washing  to alleviate anxiety caused by intrusive thoughts              
There is a great variety of mental disorders  each associated with a different form of malfunctioning  Anxiety disorders involve intense and persistent fear that is disproportionate to the actual threat and significantly impairs everyday life  An example is social phobia  which involves irrational fear of certain social situations  Anxiety disorders also include obsessive compulsive disorder  for which the anxiety manifests in the form of intrusive thoughts that the person tries to alleviate by following compulsive rituals               Mood disorders cause intense moods or mood swings that are inconsistent with the external circumstances and can last for long periods  For instance  people affected by bipolar disorder experience extreme mood swings between manic states of euphoria and depressive states of hopelessness               Personality disorders are characterized by enduring patterns of maladaptive behavior that significantly impair regular life  Paranoid personality disorder  for example  leads people to be deeply suspicious of the motives of others without rational basis               Psychotic disorders are among the most severe mental illnesses and involve a distorted relation to reality in the form of hallucinations and delusions  as seen in schizophrenia               Other disorders include dissociative disorders and eating disorders              
The biopsychosocial model identifies three types of causes of mental disorders  biological  cognitive  and environmental factors  Biological factors include bodily causes  in particular neurological influences and genetic predispositions  On the cognitive level  maladaptive beliefs and patterns of thought can be responsible  Environmental factors involve cultural influences and social events that may trigger the onset of a disorder               There are various approaches to treating mental disorders  and the most suitable treatment usually depends on the type of disorder  its cause  and the individual s overall condition  Psychotherapeutic methods use personal interaction with a therapist to change patterns of thinking  feeling  and acting               Psychoanalysis aims to help patients resolve conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious mind               Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on conscious mental phenomena to identify and change irrational beliefs and negative thought patterns               Behavior therapy relies on classical conditioning to unlearn harmful behaviors               Humanistic therapies try to help people gain insight into their self worth and empower them to resolve their problems               Drug therapies use medication to alter the brain chemistry involved in the disorder through substances like antidepressants  antipsychotics  mood stabilizers  and anxiolytics              

Fields and methods of inquiry edit 
Various fields of inquiry study the mind  including psychology  neuroscience  philosophy  and cognitive science  They differ from each other in the aspects of mind they investigate and the methods they employ               The study of the mind poses various problems since it is difficult to directly examine  manipulate  and measure it  Trying to circumvent this problem by investigating the brain comes with new challenges of its own  mainly because of the brain s complexity as a neural network consisting of billions of neurons  each with up to        links to other neurons              

Psychology edit 
Main article  Psychology
Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior  It investigates conscious and unconscious mental phenomena  including perception  memory  feeling  thought  decision  intelligence  and personality  It is further interested in their outward manifestation in the form of observable behavioral patterns  studying how these patterns depend on external circumstances and are shaped by learning               Psychology is a wide discipline that includes many subfields  Cognitive psychology is interested in higher order mental activities like thinking  problem solving  reasoning  and concept formation               Biological psychology seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms on the physiological level and how they depend on genetic transmission and the environment               Developmental psychology studies the development of the mind from childhood to old age while social psychology examines the influence of social contexts on mind and behavior               Personality psychology investigates personality  exploring how characteristic patterns of thought  feeling  and behavior develop and vary among individuals               Further subfields include comparative  clinical  educational  occupational  and neuropsychology               As a scientific discipline  psychology emerged at the end of the   th century from the experimental work of Wilhelm Wundt              Early schools of thought included structuralism  psychoanalysis  Gestalt psychology  functionalism  and behaviorism              
Psychologists use a great variety of methods to study the mind  Experimental approaches set up a controlled situation  either in the laboratory or the field  in which they modify independent variables and measure their effects on dependent variables      l      This approach makes it possible to identify causal relations between the variables  For example  to determine whether people with similar interests  independent variable  are more likely to become friends  dependent variable   participants in a study could be paired with either similar or dissimilar participants  After giving the pairs time to interact  it is assessed whether the members of similar pairs have more positive attitudes toward one another than the members of dissimilar pairs              
Correlational methods examine the strength of association between two variables without establishing a causal relationship between them               The survey method presents participants with a list of questions aimed at eliciting information about their mental attitudes  behavior  and other relevant factors  It analyzes how participants respond to questions and how answers to different questions correlate with one another               Surveys usually have a large number of participants in contrast to case studies  which focus on an in depth examination of a single subject or a small group of subjects  often to examine rare phenomena or explore new fields               Further methods include longitudinal studies  naturalistic observation  and phenomenological description of experience              

Neuroscience edit 
Main article  Neuroscience
Functional magnetic resonance imaging is a neuroimaging technique to detect brain areas with increased neural activity  shown in orange               
Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system  Its primary focus is the central nervous system and the brain in particular  but it also investigates the peripheral nervous system mainly responsible for connecting the central nervous system to the limbs and organs  Neuroscience examines the implementation of mental phenomena on a physiological basis  covering various levels of analysis  On the small scale  it studies the molecular and cellular basis of the mind  dealing with the constitution of and interaction between individual neurons  On the large scale  it analyzes the architecture of the brain as a whole and its division into regions with different functions               The study of the nervous system began in the ancient period and evolved through the centuries  including anatomical insights through dissections and speculative theories about brain functions  Neuroscience was recognized as a distinct academic discipline in the   th century as technological advances  like the development of neuroimaging techniques  revolutionized the field              
In modern neuroscience  neuroimaging techniques are of particular importance as the main research methods of neuroscientists  Functional magnetic resonance imaging  fMRI  measures changes in the magnetic field of the brain associated with blood flow  Areas of increased blood flow indicate that the corresponding brain region is particularly active  Positron emission tomography  PET  uses radioactive substances to detect a range of metabolic changes in the brain  Electroencephalography  EEG  measures the electrical activity of the brain  usually by placing electrodes on the scalp and measuring the voltage differences between them  These techniques are often employed to measure brain changes under particular circumstances  for example  while engaged in a specific cognitive task  Important insights are also gained from patients and laboratory animals with brain damage  helping neuroscientists understand the function of the damaged area and how its absence affects the remaining brain              

Philosophy of mind edit 
Main article  Philosophy of mind
Philosophy of mind examines the nature of mental phenomena and their relation to the physical world  It seeks to understand the  mark of the mental   that is  the features that all mental states have in common  It further investigates the essence of different types of mental phenomena  such as beliefs  desires  emotions  intentionality  and consciousness while exploring how they are related to one another  Philosophy of mind also examines solutions to the mind body problem  like dualism  idealism  and physicalism  and assesses arguments for and against them               It asks whether people have a free will or the ability to choose their actions  and how this ability contrasts with the idea that everything is determined by preceding causes              

The brain in a vat is a thought experiment to examine the nature of the mind and its relation to matter  It explores how a brain would experience reality if a supercomputer fed it the same electrical stimulation a normal brain receives              
While philosophers of mind also include empirical considerations in their inquiry  they differ from fields like psychology and neuroscience by giving significantly more emphasis to non empirical forms of inquiry  One such method is conceptual analysis  which aims to clarify the meaning of concepts  like mind and intention  by decomposing them to identify their semantic parts               Thought experiments are often used to evoke intuitions about abstract theories to assess their coherence and plausibility  To do so  philosophers imagine a situation relevant to a theory and employ counterfactual thinking to assess the possible consequences of this theory  Influential thought experiments include Mary the color scientist  philosophical zombies  and brain in a vat scenarios               Because of the subjective nature of the mind  the phenomenological method is also commonly used to analyze the structure of consciousness by describing experience from the first person perspective               The philosophical discussion of the mind has a long history  reaching back to antiquity  Influential contributions were made by Plato  c                BCE   Aristotle          BCE   Ren  Descartes              David Hume              Immanuel Kant              William James              and Gilbert Ryle                          

Cognitive science edit 
Main article  Cognitive science
Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of mental representations and processes  It aims to overcome the challenge of understanding something as complex as the mind by integrating research from diverse fields ranging from psychology and neuroscience to philosophy  linguistics  and artificial intelligence  Unlike these disciplines  it is not a unified field but a collaborative effort  One difficulty in synthesizing their insights is that each of these disciplines explores the mind from a different perspective and level of abstraction while using different research methods to arrive at its conclusion               Cognitive science emerged in the second half of the   th century as researchers from various disciplines began to examine how mental processes represent the world and transform information  The field expanded in the     s following advances in neuroimaging to include a biological perspective on how computational processes are implemented by the brain              
To incorporate insights from diverse disciplines  cognitive science relies on a unified conceptualization of minds as information processors  This means that mental processes are understood as computations that retrieve  transform  store  and transmit information               For example  perception retrieves sensory information from the environment and transforms it to extract meaningful patterns that can be used in other mental processes  such as planning and decision making               Cognitive science relies on different levels of description to analyze cognitive processes  The most abstract level focuses on the basic problem the process is supposed to solve and the reasons why the organism needs to solve it  The intermediate level seeks to uncover the algorithm as a formal step by step procedure to solve the problem  The most concrete level asks how the algorithm is implemented through physiological changes on the level of the brain               Another methodology is to analyze the mind as a complex system composed of individual subsystems that can be studied independently of one another              

Relation to other fields edit 
The mind is relevant to many fields  In epistemology  the problem of other minds is the challenge of explaining how it is possible to know that people other than oneself have a mind  The difficulty arises from the fact that people directly experience their own minds but do not have the same access to the minds of others  According to a common view  it is necessary to rely on perception to observe the behavior of others and then infer that they have a mind based on analogical or abductive reasoning               Closely related to this problem is theory of mind in psychology  which is the ability to understand that other people possess beliefs  desires  intentions  and feelings that may differ from one s own              
Anthropology is interested in how different cultures conceptualize the nature of mind and its relation to the world  These conceptualizations affect the way people understand themselves  experience illness  and interpret ritualistic practices as attempts to commune with spirits  Some cultures do not draw a strict boundary between mind and world by allowing that thoughts can pass directly into the world and manifest as beneficial or harmful forces  For instance  some indigenous beliefs systems  like traditional beliefs in the Azande culture  hold that angry thoughts can directly damage another person s crops or make them ill  Other cultures strictly separate the mind from external reality  seeing it as an internal phenomenon without supernatural powers               Sociology is a related field concerned with the connections between mind  society  and behavior               Among other topics  it is interested in the phenomenon of intersubjectivity  which happens when different people have a shared understanding or experience  meaning that their cognitive perspectives overlap              
The concept of mind plays a central role in various religions  Buddhists say that there is no enduring self underlying mental activity  They analyze the mind as a stream of constantly changing experiences characterized by five aspects or  aggregates   material form  feelings  perception  volition  and consciousness               Hindus  by contrast  affirm the existence of a permanent self  In an influential analogy  the human mind is compared to a horse drawn chariot  the horses are the senses  which lure the sense mind corresponding to the reins through sensual pleasures  The senses are controlled by the charioteer embodying the intellect while the self is a passenger               In traditional Christian philosophy  mind and soul are closely intertwined as the immaterial aspect of humans that may survive bodily death               Islamic thought distinguishes between mind  spirit  heart  and self as interconnected aspects of the spiritual dimension of humans               Daoism and Confucianism use the concept of heart mind as the center of cognitive and emotional life  encompassing thought  understanding  will  desire  and mood              

Phrenology was a pseudoscientific attempt to correlate mental functions to brain areas              
In the field of education  the minds of students are shaped through the transmission of knowledge  skills  and character traits as a process of socialization and enculturation  This is achieved through different teaching methods including the contrast between group work and individual learning and the use of instructional media               Teacher centered education positions the teacher as the central authority controlling the learning process whereas in student centered education  students have a more active role in shaping classroom activities               The choice of the most effective method to develop the minds of the learners is determined by various factors  including the topic and the learner s age and skill level              
The mind is a frequent subject of pseudoscientific inquiry  Phrenology was an early attempt to correlate mental functions with specific brain areas  While its central claims about predicting mental traits by measuring bumps on the skull did not survive scientific scrutiny  the underlying idea that certain mental functions are localized in particular regions of the brain is now widely accepted               Parapsychologists seek to discover and study paranormal mental abilities ranging from clairvoyance to telepathy and telekinesis

  Not all languages have a word that directly corresponds to the English word mind  For example  German uses the word Geist  which can mean both  mind  or  spirit              

  The precise differences between these concepts are disputed  In Freud s psychoanalysis  the preconscious mind lies outside current awareness but can easily be accessed  whereas the unconscious mind is further removed from deliberate access  The word subconscious is sometimes used as a synonym of preconscious             

  Some mental states  like perceptions and emotions  may have both qualitative and propositional aspects             

  Mental faculties also play a central role in the Indian tradition  such as the contrast between the sense mind  manas  and intellect  buddhi              

  A different perspective is proposed by the massive modularity hypothesis  which states that the mind is entirely composed of modules with high level modules establishing the connection between low level modules             

  Intentionality is to be distinguished from intention in the sense of having a plan to perform a certain action             

  More generally  embodied cognition is the study of the effects of bodily phenomena on the mind  It examines  for example  how certain bodily movements improve or hinder cognitive performance and how motor capacities affect the development of cognitive abilities             

  According to Aristotle s hylomorphism  for example  they are complementary principles  the soul is the form of the body while the body is the matter of the soul             

  There are other forms of idealism that assert slightly different positions  such as transcendental idealism and absolute idealism             

  The two terms are usually treated as synonyms but some theorists distinguish them by holding that materialism is restricted to matter while physicalism is a wider term that includes additional physical phenomena  like forces             

  They include cnidarians and ctenophorans              

  Psychometrics examines how to measure the mental attributes or psychological constructs underlying the variables  For example  IQ tests are one way to quantify intelligence
