MerexMarkets is a money management company that aims to provide the best foreign exchange  Forex  managed accounts to retail and institutional investors through an automated trading system  The Daily News Egypt interviewed Ehab El Saadany  MerexMarkets  Marketing Manager  to identify the company s future plans and the challenges they are facing in Egypt 
 nbsp 
Firstly  can you define the idea of MerexMarkets 
MerexMarkets is a money management company with an automated trading system that works strictly in the foreign exchange market  We offer portfolio management services for a wide range of clients 
When did MerexMarkets start operating in Egypt  And what are the other countries you operate in 
We have been operating in Egypt since       with further operations in more than    countries around the world  We also have offices in countries such as Georgia and Romania  and we also have liquidity providers in Cyprus  Australia and Switzerland 
What do you think is the difference between MerexMarkets and other foreign exchange firm 
There are many differences  for example  we have no commissions  no swap and no managerial fees  We also have many deposit and withdrawal methods  and we provide      customer support and full transparency in trade transactions 
What is the Portfolio Management System that you provide 
Forex as a business has a very bad reputation in the Middle East due to un experienced traders  who lose a lot of money  That s why MerexMarkets came up with the idea of  Portfolio Management Systems  as a solution for those investors lacking the necessary time or experience to trade 
How can the Management Systems help inexperienced investors 
MerexMarkets Portfolio Managed Accounts are types of Forex accounts in which the money management system is trading the account and managing risk on a client s behalf  More than     of traders who trade by themselves are subject to marginal call within a month of opening their account  while at MerexMarkets  we manage funds and have control over involved risk 
 nbsp 
How can someone test the performance on the Portfolio Management System before starting 
 nbsp 
MerexMarkets offers Demo Managed Accounts  which are an excellent opportunity to evaluate and appreciate the advantages of the company s portfolio management system  The client is given the chance to observe all the trading activities as well as the placed trades  All the funds are well managed  and all risks are well controlled  You can also observe account performance in relation to the market 
What are your plans for this year and the coming year 
We are on the right track of being the market leader in the Middle East and North Africa in the field of portfolio management  MerexMarkets won the award of  The Best Portoflio Manager  and  Best Automated Trading System  in the      and      MENA Forex Expo and in the Jordan Forex Expo 
Continuing our success  we will participate in the      Africa Forex Expo in South Africa  the Middle East Expo in Kuwait and the Turkey Forex Expo 
How do you evaluate the foreign exchange market in Egypt compared to the Middle East s 
The Egyptian market is a rich market  but it is very prone to rumours  On the contrary  foreign exchange trading is common in the Gulf region and it provides traders with high returns 
What are the difficulties you have faced in the Egyptian market 
The nature of the Egyptian investor himself  who tends to be very sensitive to rumours  is a problem  There is also a bad history of a couple of companies that scammed investors  which made it harder for a new foreign exchange company to penetrate the market 
How do you assess the CBE s strategies to maintain the value of the Egyptian Pound 
We are not concerned with the Egyptian market  however  after restoring the political stability  foreign investments will return and the value of the EGP shall be kept
