							Al Ismaelia for Real Estate Investment and Coventry University Cairo Branch at The Knowledge Hub Universities  TKH  launched a collaboration on May          to link academic learning with practical urban development in Downtown Cairo  The initiative aims to give students direct experience in the area       s revitalisation and enhance architectural education standards in Egypt 
Unveiled at a media roundtable at Consoleya  the partnership will integrate academic training with fieldwork across architecture  interior design  product and graphic design  digital media  and film production 
Students will work on Al Ismaelia s Downtown sites  research development challenges  and explore design in a historically layered  evolving city  The collaboration aims to prepare students for urban work by allowing them to shape real projects and learn to balance heritage  function  and design 
 Education doesn t stop in the classroom  Downtown Cairo  with its historic architecture and layered urban character  offers an unparalleled setting for applied learning   said Philopateer Dimitri  Deputy CEO of Al Ismaelia   What we re trying to do is simple  bring students into the field  let them work on real challenges  and help them understand how buildings  branding  and spaces affect everyday life  At the same time  we re supporting their growth as professionals  
Al Ismaelia has been involved in Downtown Cairo       s revival for the past decade  focusing on adaptive reuse  sustainable renovation  and heritage preservation  aiming to balance modern needs with cultural legacy 
Under the agreement  Al Ismaelia will provide internships  host student exhibitions  and incorporate student projects into urban development  Student work will include redesigning spaces  re evaluating pedestrian movement  and creating visual identities for Downtown that reflect its heritage and future 
For Coventry University  the partnership aligns with its goal of more practice based programs  Students will research adaptive reuse  sustainable real estate  and public space branding  topics relevant to Cairo       s development 
 Part of our mission is to ensure students learn concepts  but more importantly  apply them   said Prof  Dr  Yasser Sakr  President of The Knowledge Hub Universities  Coventry University Egypt s branch host  He added   Partnering with Al Ismaelia was a natural choice for us  Few companies in Egypt have demonstrated the same level of care  expertise  and long term commitment to sustainable urban development  This approach offers our students a rare opportunity  to learn from a living example of how heritage  modern design  and community needs can come together successfully  This partnership allows our students to see their work take shape in the real world  and to understand the weight of designing in a city like Cairo  
Al Ismaelia plans to expand such collaborations to other Egyptian universities to support students and elevate architectural thinking  adaptive reuse  and cultural preservation 
 There s an opportunity here to rethink how we build   Dimitri added   We want to work with students who are curious  capable  and eager to get involved  and we want to show them that Egypt s cities are places that need thoughtful design and solid execution
