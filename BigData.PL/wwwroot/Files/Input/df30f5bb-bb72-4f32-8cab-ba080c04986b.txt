							Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivering the Eid al Fitr prayer sermon at Tehran University on August          Khamenei ir AFP 
AFP         Iran       s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned on Friday that the political crisis in Egypt after the army ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi could spark a civil war 
       We are worried about what is happening in Egypt         he said in Eid al Fitr remarks broadcast on state television 
       Speculation of a civil war is gaining momentum on a daily basis         Khamenei said         This would be a disaster with dire consequences        
       What will stop the civil war if  God forbid  it happens         he asked 
Khamenei       s comments came a day after Egypt       s interim presidency said Western and Arab initiatives to resolve its political deadlock had failed 
More than     people have been killed since the ouster of president Mohamed Morsi by the military on July    a coup which the Islamic republic condemned 
Khamenei also warned against foreign interference in Egypt  saying         Nothing but damage for the Egyptian people will come from the interference of foreign powers        
Iran       s supreme leader strongly condemned political violence in Egypt  and called on its religious and political parties to learn from the lessons of Syria
