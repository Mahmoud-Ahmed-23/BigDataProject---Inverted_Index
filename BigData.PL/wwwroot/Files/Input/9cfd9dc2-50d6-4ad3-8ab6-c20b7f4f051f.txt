Frankenstein  or  The Modern Prometheus is an      Gothic novel written by English author Mary Shelley  Frankenstein tells the story of Victor Frankenstein  a young scientist who creates a sapient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment  Shelley started writing the story when she was     and the first edition was published anonymously in London on   January       when she was     Her name first appeared in the second edition  which was published in Paris in      
Shelley travelled through Europe in       moving along the river Rhine in Germany  and stopping in Gernsheim     kilometres          mi  away from Frankenstein Castle  where  about a century earlier  Johann Konrad Dippel  an alchemist  had engaged in experiments                                   She then journeyed to the region of Geneva  Switzerland  where much of the story takes place  Galvanism and occult ideas were topics of conversation for her companions  particularly for her lover and future husband Percy Bysshe Shelley 
In       Mary  Percy  John Polidori  and Lord Byron had a competition to see who would write the best horror story             
After thinking for days  Shelley was inspired to write Frankenstein after imagining a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made            
Frankenstein is one of the best known works of English literature  Infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement  it has had a considerable influence on literature and on popular culture  spawning a complete genre of horror stories  films  and plays  Since the publication of the novel  the name Frankenstein has often been used to refer to the monster

Author s background edit 
Mary Shelley by Richard Rothwell          
Mary Shelley s mother  Mary Wollstonecraft  died from infection eleven days after giving birth to her  Shelley grew close to her father  William Godwin  having never known her mother  Godwin hired a nurse  who briefly cared for her and her half sister  before marrying his second wife Mary Jane Clairmont  who did not like the close bond between Shelley and her father  The resulting friction caused Godwin to favour his other children 
Shelley s father was a famous author of the time  and her education was of great importance to him  although it was not formal  Shelley grew up surrounded by her father s friends  writers  and persons of political importance  who often gathered at the family home  This inspired her authorship at an early age  Mary  at the age of sixteen  met Percy Bysshe Shelley  who later became her husband  while he was visiting her father  Godwin did not approve of the relationship between his daughter and an older  married man  so they fled to France along with her stepsister  Claire Clairmont  On    February       Shelley gave birth prematurely to her first child  Clara  who died two weeks later             
In the summer of       Mary  Percy  and Claire took a trip to visit Claire s lover  Lord Byron  in Geneva  Poor weather conditions  more akin to winter  forced Byron and the visitors to stay indoors  To help pass time  Byron suggested that he  Mary  Percy  and Byron s physician  John Polidori  have a competition to write the best ghost story to pass time stuck indoors               Mary was just eighteen years old when she won the contest with her creation of Frankenstein                         

Literary influences edit 
Shelley s work was heavily influenced by that of her parents  Her father was famous for Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and her mother famous for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman  Her father s novels also influenced her writing of Frankenstein  These novels included Things as They Are  or  The Adventures of Caleb Williams  St  Leon  and Fleetwood  All of these books were set in Switzerland  similar to the setting in Frankenstein  Some major themes of social affections and the renewal of life that appear in Shelley s novel stem from these works she had in her possession  Other literary influences that appear in Frankenstein are Pygmalion et Galat e by Mme de Genlis  and Ovid  with the use of individuals identifying the problems with society              Ovid also inspires the use of Prometheus in Shelley s title             
The influence of John Milton s Paradise Lost and Samuel Taylor Coleridge s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner are evident in the novel  In The Frankenstein of the French Revolution  author Julia Douthwaite posits that Shelley probably acquired some ideas for Frankenstein s character from Humphry Davy s book Elements of Chemical Philosophy  in which he had written that 

science has     bestowed upon man powers which may be called creative  which have enabled him to change and modify the beings around him      
References to the French Revolution run through the novel  a likely source is Fran ois F lix Nogaret           fr      s Le Miroir des  v nemens actuels  ou la Belle au plus offrant         a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named Frank ste n  who creates a life sized automaton             
Both Frankenstein and the monster quote passages from Percy Shelley s      poem   Mutability   and its theme of the role of the subconscious is discussed in prose  Percy Shelley s name never appeared as the author of the poem  although the novel credits other quoted poets by name  Samuel Taylor Coleridge s poem  The Rime of the Ancient Mariner         is associated with the theme of guilt and William Wordsworth s  Tintern Abbey         with that of innocence 
Many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then popular natural philosophers  now called physical scientists  with Shelley s work because of several notable similarities  Two of the most noted natural philosophers among Shelley s contemporaries were Giovanni Aldini  who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bio electric Galvanism in London              and Johann Konrad Dippel  who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans  While Shelley was aware of both of these men and their activities  she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes 
Ideas about life and death discussed by Percy and Byron were of great interest to scientists of that time  They discussed ideas from Erasmus Darwin and the experiments of Luigi Galvani as well as James Lind              Mary joined these conversations and the ideas of Darwin  Galvani and perhaps Lind were present in her novel 
Shelley s personal experiences also influenced the themes within Frankenstein  The themes of loss  guilt  and the consequences of defying nature present in the novel all developed from Mary Shelley s own life  The loss of her mother  the relationship with her father  and the death of her first child are thought to have inspired the monster and his separation from parental guidance  In a      issue of The Journal of Religion and Health a psychologist proposed that the theme of guilt stemmed from her not feeling good enough for Percy because of the loss of their child             

Composition edit 
Draft of Frankenstein   It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld my man completed           
During the rainy summer of       the  Year Without a Summer   the world was locked in a long  cold volcanic winter caused by the eruption of Mount Tambora in                               Mary Shelley  aged     and her lover  and future husband   Percy Bysshe Shelley  visited Lord Byron at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva  in Switzerland s Alps  The weather was too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned  so the group retired indoors until dawn 
Sitting around a log fire at Byron s villa  the company amused themselves by reading German ghost stories translated into French from the book Fantasmagoriana              Byron proposed that they  each write a ghost story               Unable to think of a story  Mary Shelley became anxious  She recalled being asked  Have you thought of a story   each morning  and every time being  forced to reply with a mortifying negative               During one evening in the middle of summer  the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life   Perhaps a corpse would be re animated   Mary noted   galvanism had given token of such things               It was after midnight before they retired and  unable to sleep  she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the  grim terrors  of her  waking dream             

I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together  I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out  and then  on the working of some powerful engine  show signs of life  and stir with an uneasy  half vital motion  Frightful must it be  for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world             
In September       astronomer Donald Olson  after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa in the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars  concluded that her  waking dream  took place between   a m  and   a m  on    June       several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story             
Mary Shelley began writing what she assumed would be a short story  but with Percy Shelley s encouragement  she expanded the tale into a fully fledged novel              She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment  when I first stepped out from childhood into life               Shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half sister Fanny              This was one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelley s work  Shelley s first child died in infancy  and when she began composing Frankenstein in       she was probably nursing her second child  who was also dead by the time of Frankenstein     s publication              Shelley wrote much of the book while residing in a lodging house in the centre of Bath in                  
Byron managed to write just a fragment based on the vampire legends he heard while travelling the Balkans  and from this John Polidori created The Vampyre         the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre  Thus two seminal horror tales originated from the conclave                                     
The group talked about Enlightenment and Counter Enlightenment ideas as well  Mary Shelley believed the Enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly  however  she also believed the Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society             
Shelley s manuscripts for the first three volume edition in       written             as well as the fair copy for her publisher  are now housed in the Bodleian Library in Oxford  The Bodleian acquired the papers in       and they belong now to the Abinger Collection                          In       the Bodleian published a new edition of Frankenstein  edited by Charles E  Robinson  that contains comparisons of Mary Shelley s original text with Percy Shelley s additions and interventions alongside             

Frankenstein and the Monster edit 
The Creature edit 
Main article  Frankenstein s monster
An English editorial cartoonist conceives the Irish Fenian movement as akin to Frankenstein s creature  in the wake of the Phoenix Park murders in an      issue of Punch             
Although the Creature was described in later works as a composite of whole body parts grafted together from cadavers and reanimated by the use of electricity  this description is not consistent with Shelley s work  both the use of electricity and the cobbled together image of Frankenstein s monster were more the result of James Whale s popular      film adaptation of the story and other early motion picture works based on the creature  In Shelley s original work  Victor Frankenstein discovers a previously unknown but elemental principle of life  and that insight allows him to develop a method to imbue vitality into inanimate matter  though the exact nature of the process is left ambiguous  After a great deal of hesitation in exercising this power  Frankenstein spends two years painstakingly constructing the Creature s body  one anatomical feature at a time  from raw materials supplied by  the dissecting room and the slaughter house    which he then brings to life using his unspecified process

Part of Frankenstein s rejection of his creation is the fact that he does not give him a name  Instead  Frankenstein s creation is referred to by words such as  wretch    monster    creature    demon    devil    fiend   and  it   When Frankenstein converses with the creature  he addresses him as  vile insect    abhorred monster    fiend    wretched devil   and  abhorred devil  

In the novel  the creature is compared to Adam              the first man in the Garden of Eden  The monster also compares himself with the  fallen  angel  Speaking to Frankenstein  the monster says  I ought to be thy Adam  but I am rather the fallen angel    That angel would be Lucifer  meaning  light bringer   in Milton s Paradise Lost  which the monster has read  Adam is also referred to in the epigraph of the      edition             
Did I request thee  Maker  from my clay
To mould Me man  Did I solicit thee
From darkness to promote me             
Some have posited the creature as a composite of Percy Shelley and Thomas Paine  If the creature s hatred for Victor and his desire to raise a child mirror Percy s filial rebelliousness and his longing to adopt children  his desire to do good and his persecution can be said to echo Paine s utopian visions and fate in England             
The Creature has often been mistakenly called Frankenstein  In       one author said  It is strange to note how well nigh universally the term  Frankenstein  is misused  even by intelligent people  as describing some hideous monster               Edith Wharton s The Reef        describes an unruly child as an  infant Frankenstein               David Lindsay s  The Bridal Ornament   published in The Rover     June       mentioned  the maker of poor Frankenstein   After the release of Whale s cinematic Frankenstein  the public at large began speaking of the Creature itself as  Frankenstein   This misnomer continued with the successful sequel Bride of Frankenstein         as well as in film titles such as Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein

Origin of Victor Frankenstein s name edit 
Mary Shelley maintained that she derived the name Frankenstein from a dream vision  This claim has since been disputed and debated by scholars that have suggested alternative sources for Shelley s inspiration              The German name Frankenstein means  stone of the Franks   and is associated with various places in Germany  including Frankenstein Castle  Burg Frankenstein  in Darmstadt  Hesse  and Frankenstein Castle in Frankenstein  a town in the Palatinate  There is also a castle called Frankenstein in Bad Salzungen  Thuringia  and a municipality called Frankenstein in Saxony  The town of Frankenstein in Silesia  now Z bkowice  Poland  was the site of a scandal involving gravediggers in       and this has been suggested as an inspiration to the author              Finally  the name is borne by the aristocratic House of Franckenstein from Franconia 
Radu Florescu argued that Mary and Percy Shelley visited Frankenstein Castle near Darmstadt in       where alchemist Johann Konrad Dippel had experimented with human bodies  and reasoned that Mary suppressed mention of her visit to maintain her public claim of originality              A literary essay by A J  Day supports Florescu s position that Mary Shelley knew of and visited Frankenstein Castle before writing her debut novel              Day includes details of an alleged description of the Frankenstein castle in Mary Shelley s  lost journals   However  according to J rg Hel ne  Day s and Florescu s claims cannot be verified             
A possible interpretation of the name  Victor  is derived from Paradise Lost by John Milton  a great influence on Shelley  a quotation from Paradise Lost is on the opening page of Frankenstein and Shelley writes that the monster reads it in the novel                           Milton frequently refers to God as  the victor  in Paradise Lost  and Victor s creation of life in the novel is compared to God s creation of life in Paradise Lost  In addition  Shelley s portrayal of the monster owes much to the character of Satan in Paradise Lost  and  the monster says in the story  after reading the epic poem  that he empathizes with Satan s role 
Parallels between Victor Frankenstein and Mary s husband  Percy Shelley  have also been drawn  Percy Shelley was the first born son of a wealthy country squire with strong political connections and a descendant of Sir Bysshe Shelley   st Baronet of Castle Goring  and Richard Fitzalan    th Earl of Arundel      citation needed      Similarly  Victor s family is one of the most distinguished of that republic and his ancestors were counsellors and syndics  Percy s sister and Victor s adopted sister were both named Elizabeth  There are many other similarities  from Percy s usage of  Victor  as a pen name for Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire  a collection of poetry he wrote with Elizabeth              to Percy s days at Eton  where he had  experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions   and the way in which Percy s rooms at Oxford were filled with scientific equipment                         

Modern Prometheus edit 
The Modern Prometheus is the novel s subtitle  though modern editions now drop it  only mentioning it in introduction               Prometheus  in versions of Greek mythology  was the Titan who created humans in the image of the gods so that they could have a spirit breathed into them at the behest of Zeus      a      Prometheus then taught humans to hunt  but after he tricked Zeus into accepting  poor quality offerings  from humans  Zeus kept fire from humankind  Prometheus took back the fire from Zeus to give to humanity  When Zeus discovered this  he sentenced Prometheus to be eternally punished by fixing him to a rock of Caucasus  where each day an eagle pecked out his liver  only for the liver to regrow the next day because of his immortality as a god 
As a Pythagorean  or believer in An Essay on Abstinence from Animal Food  as a Moral Duty by Joseph Ritson              Mary Shelley saw Prometheus not as a hero but rather as something of a devil  and blamed him for bringing fire to humanity and thereby seducing the human race to the vice of eating meat                  full citation needed      Percy wrote several essays on what became known as vegetarianism including A Vindication of Natural Diet             

In       Edison Studios released the first motion picture adaptation of Shelley s story 
Byron was particularly attached to the play Prometheus Bound by Aeschylus  and Percy Shelley soon wrote his own Prometheus Unbound         The term  Modern Prometheus  was derived from Immanuel Kant who described Benjamin Franklin as the  Prometheus of modern times  in reference to his experiments with electricity             

Publication edit 
Shelley completed her writing in April May       and Frankenstein  or  The Modern Prometheus was published on   January                  by the small London publishing house Lackington  Hughes  Harding  Mavor   amp  Jones                          It was issued anonymously  with a preface written for Mary by Percy Bysshe Shelley and with a dedication to philosopher William Godwin  her father  It was published in an edition of just     copies in three volumes  the standard  triple decker  format for   th century first editions 

A variety of different editions
A French translation  Frankenstein  ou le Prom th e Moderne  translated by Jules Saladin  appeared as early as       The second English edition of Frankenstein was published on    August      in two volumes  by G  and W  B  Whittaker  following the success of the stage play Presumption  or  the Fate of Frankenstein by Richard Brinsley Peake              This edition credited Mary Shelley as the book s author on its title page 
On    October       the first  popular  edition in one volume appeared  published by Henry Colburn  amp  Richard Bentley              This edition was heavily revised by Mary Shelley  partially to make the story less radical  It included a lengthy new preface by the author  presenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story  This edition is the one most widely published and read now  although a few editions follow the      text              Some scholars such as Anne K  Mellor prefer the original version  arguing that it preserves the spirit of Mary Shelley s vision             

Reception edit 
Contemporary critical reviews were mixed  Walter Scott  writing in Blackwood s Edinburgh Magazine  praised the novel as an  extraordinary tale  in which the author seems to us to disclose uncommon powers of poetic imagination   although he was less convinced about the way in which the monster gains knowledge about the world and language              La Belle Assembl e described the novel as  very bold fiction              and the Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany hoped to see  more productions     from this author               On the other hand  John Wilson Croker  writing anonymously in the Quarterly Review  although conceding that  the author has powers  both of conception and language   described the book as  a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity              
The British Critic attacked the novel s flaws as the fault of the author  

The writer of it is  we understand  a female  this is an aggravation of that which is the prevailing fault of the novel  but if our authoress can forget the gentleness of her sex  it is no reason why we should  and we shall therefore dismiss the novel without further comment              
The Literary Panorama and National Register attacked the novel as a  feeble imitation of Mr  Godwin s novels  produced by the  daughter of a celebrated living novelist               
Despite these reviews  Frankenstein achieved an almost immediate popular success  It became widely known  especially through melodramatic theatrical adaptations  Mary Shelley saw a production of Presumption  or The Fate of Frankenstein  a play by Richard Brinsley Peake  in      
Critical reception of Frankenstein has been largely positive since the mid   th century              Major critics such as M  A  Goldberg and Harold Bloom have praised the  aesthetic and moral  relevance of the novel              although there have also been critics  such as Germaine Greer  who criticized the novel for technical and narrative defects  for example  she claimed that its three narrators all speak in the same way              In more recent years the novel has become a popular subject for psychoanalytic and feminist criticism  Lawrence Lipking states    E ven the Lacanian subgroup of psychoanalytic criticism  for instance  has produced at least half a dozen discrete readings of the novel               Frankenstein has frequently been recommended on Five Books  with literary scholars  psychologists  novelists  and historians citing it as an influential text              Today  the novel is generally considered to be a landmark work as one of the greatest Romantic and Gothic novels  as well as one of the first science fiction novels             
Brian Aldiss has argued for regarding it as the first true science fiction story  In contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction  Aldiss states  the central character  makes a deliberate decision  and  turns to modern experiments in the laboratory  to achieve fantastic results             
Film director Guillermo del Toro describes Frankenstein as  the quintessential teenage book   noting that the feelings that  You don t belong  You were brought to this world by people that don t care for you and you are thrown into a world of pain and suffering  and tears and hunger  are an important part of the story  He adds that  it s an amazing book written by a teenage girl  It s mind blowing               Professor of philosophy Patricia MacCormack says that the Creature addresses the most fundamental human questions   It s the idea of asking your maker what your purpose is  Why are we here  what can we do              
On   November       BBC News included Frankenstein in its list of the     most influential novels              In       Jersey Post released series of   stamps celebrating the    th anniversary of Frankenstein              In      it was one of six classic science fiction novels by British authors selected by Royal Mail to be featured on a series of UK postage stamps

Notes edit 


  In the best known versions of the Prometheus story  by Hesiod and Aeschylus  Prometheus merely brings fire to humankind  but in other versions  such as several of Aesop s fables  See in particular Fable       Sappho  Fragment       and Ovid s Metamorphoses  Prometheus is the actual creator of humanity

Differences between      and      text edit 
Shelley made several alterations in the      edition including 

The epigraph from Milton s Paradise Lost found in the      original has been removed 
Chapter one is expanded and split into two chapters 
Elizabeth s origin is changed from Victor s cousin to being an orphan 
Victor is portrayed more sympathetically in the original text  In the      edition however  Shelley is critical of his decisions and actions 
Shelley removed many references to scientific ideas which were popular around the time she wrote the      edition of the book 
Characters in the      version have some dialogue removed entirely while others receive new dialogue
