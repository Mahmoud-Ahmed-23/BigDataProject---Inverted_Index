Surname edit 
There are three very simple English words   Has    him  and  of   Put them together like this  has him of  and say it in the ordinary fashion  Now leave out the two h s and say it again and you have Asimov         Asimov                  
Asimov s family name derives from the first part of              oz myj khleb   meaning  winter grain   specifically rye  in which his great great great grandfather dealt  with the Russian surname ending  ov added              Azimov is spelled        in the Cyrillic alphabet             When the family arrived in the United States in      and their name had to be spelled in the Latin alphabet  Asimov s father spelled it with an S  believing this letter to be pronounced like Z  as in German   and so it became Asimov             This later inspired one of Asimov s short stories   Spell My Name with an S              
Asimov refused early suggestions of using a more common name as a pseudonym  believing that its recognizability helped his career  After becoming famous  he often met readers who believed that  Isaac Asimov  was a distinctive pseudonym created by an author with a common name             

Life edit 
Early life edit 
Asimov was born in Petrovichi  Russian SFSR              on an unknown date between October          and January          inclusive  Asimov celebrated his birthday on January        a     
Asimov s parents were Russian Jews  Anna Rachel  n e Berman  and Judah Asimov  the son of a miller              He was named Isaac after his mother s father  Isaac Berman              Asimov wrote of his father   My father  for all his education as an Orthodox Jew  was not Orthodox in his heart   noting that  he didn t recite the myriad prayers prescribed for every action  and he never made any attempt to teach them to me              
In       Asimov and    other children in Petrovichi developed double pneumonia  Only Asimov survived              He had two younger siblings  a sister  Marcia  born Manya              June                 April                       and a brother  Stanley  July                 August            who would become vice president of Newsday                         
Asimov s family travelled to the United States via Liverpool on the RMS Baltic  arriving on February                     when he was three years old  His parents spoke Yiddish and English to him  he never learned Russian  his parents using it as a secret language  when they wanted to discuss something privately that my big ears were not to hear                           Growing up in Brooklyn  New York  Asimov taught himself to read at the age of five  and later taught his sister to read as well  enabling her to enter school in the second grade               His mother got him into first grade a year early by claiming he was born on September                                  In third grade he learned about the  error  and insisted on an official correction of the date to January                He became a naturalized U S  citizen in      at the age of eight             
After becoming established in the U S   his parents owned a succession of candy stores in which everyone in the family was expected to work  The candy stores sold newspapers and magazines  which Asimov credited as a major influence in his lifelong love of the written word  as it presented him as a child with an unending supply of new reading material  including pulp science fiction magazines              that he could not have otherwise afforded  Asimov began reading science fiction at age nine  at the time that the genre was becoming more science centered              Asimov was also a frequent patron of the Brooklyn Public Library during his formative years             

Education and career edit 
Asimov attended New York City public schools from age five  including Boys High School in Brooklyn              Graduating at     he attended the City College of New York for several days before accepting a scholarship at Seth Low Junior College  This was a branch of Columbia University in Downtown Brooklyn designed to absorb some of the academically qualified Jewish and Italian American students who applied to the more prestigious Columbia College but exceeded the unwritten ethnic admission quotas which were common at the time  Originally a zoology major  Asimov switched to chemistry after his first semester because he disapproved of  dissecting an alley cat   After Seth Low Junior College closed in       Asimov finished his Bachelor of Science degree at Columbia s Morningside Heights campus  later the Columbia University School of General Studies              in        In       Dr  Robert Pollack  dean of Columbia College             granted Asimov an honorary doctorate from Columbia College after requiring that Asimov place his foot in a bucket of water to pass the college s swimming requirement              
After two rounds of rejections by medical schools  Asimov applied to the graduate program in chemistry at Columbia in       initially he was rejected and then only accepted on a probationary basis              He completed his Master of Arts degree in chemistry in      and earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in chemistry in           e                              During his chemistry studies  he also learned French and German             

Robert A  Heinlein  L  Sprague de Camp  and Asimov  left to right   Philadelphia Navy Yard      
From      to      during World War II  between his masters and doctoral studies  Asimov worked as a civilian chemist at the Philadelphia Navy Yard s Naval Air Experimental Station and lived in the Walnut Hill section of West Philadelphia                          In September       he was conscripted into the post war U S  Army  if he had not had his birth date corrected while at school  he would have been officially    years old and ineligible              In       a bureaucratic error caused his military allotment to be stopped  and he was removed from a task force days before it sailed to participate in Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons tests at Bikini Atoll              He was  promoted to corporal on July    before receiving an honorable discharge on July                           f     
After completing his doctorate and a postdoctoral year with Robert Elderfield              Asimov was offered the position of associate professor of biochemistry at the Boston University School of Medicine  This was in large part due to his years long correspondence with William Boyd  a former associate professor of biochemistry at Boston University  who initially contacted Asimov to compliment him on his story Nightfall              Upon receiving a promotion to professor of immunochemistry  Boyd reached out to Asimov  requesting him to be his replacement  The initial offer of professorship was withdrawn and Asimov was offered the position of instructor of biochemistry instead  which he accepted              He began work in      with a        salary              equivalent to             in        maintaining this position for several years              By       however  he was making more money as a writer than from the university  and he eventually stopped doing research  confining his university role to lecturing students      g      In       he was promoted to tenured associate professor  In December       Asimov was dismissed from his teaching post  with effect from June           due to his lack of research  After a struggle over two years  he reached an agreement with the university that he would keep his title             and give the opening lecture each year for a biochemistry class              On October           the university honored his writing by promoting him to full professor of biochemistry              Asimov s personal papers from      onward are archived at the university s Mugar Memorial Library  to which he donated them at the request of curator Howard Gotlieb                         
In       after a recommendation from Arthur Obermayer  Asimov s friend and a scientist on the U S  missile defense project  Asimov was approached by DARPA to join Obermayer s team  Asimov declined on the grounds that his ability to write freely would be impaired should he receive classified information  but submitted a paper to DARPA titled  On Creativity              containing ideas on how government based science projects could encourage team members to think more creatively

Asimov met his first wife  Gertrude Blugerman  May           Toronto  Canada                    October           Boston  U S                on a blind date on February           and married her on July                 The couple lived in an apartment in West Philadelphia while Asimov was employed at the Philadelphia Navy Yard  where two of his co workers were L  Sprague de Camp and Robert A  Heinlein   Gertrude returned to Brooklyn while he was in the Army  and they both lived there from July      before moving to Stuyvesant Town  Manhattan  in July       They moved to Boston in May       then to nearby suburbs Somerville in July       Waltham in May       and  finally  West Newton in                   They had two children  David  born       and Robyn Joan  born                    In       they separated and Asimov moved back to New York  this time to the Upper West Side of Manhattan where he lived for the rest of his life              He began seeing Janet O  Jeppson  a psychiatrist and science fiction writer  and married her on November                       two weeks after his divorce from Gertrude             
Asimov was a claustrophile  he enjoyed small  enclosed spaces                  h      In the third volume of his autobiography  he recalls a childhood desire to own a magazine stand in a New York City Subway station  within which he could enclose himself and listen to the rumble of passing trains while reading             
Asimov was afraid of flying  doing so only twice  once in the course of his work at the Naval Air Experimental Station and once returning home from O ahu in       Consequently  he seldom traveled great distances  This phobia influenced several of his fiction works  such as the Wendell Urth mystery stories and the Robot novels featuring Elijah Baley  In his later years  Asimov found enjoyment traveling on cruise ships  beginning in      when he viewed the Apollo    launch from a cruise ship              On several cruises  he was part of the entertainment program  giving science themed talks aboard ships such as the Queen Elizabeth                He sailed to England in June      on the SS      France for a trip mostly devoted to lectures in London and Birmingham              though he also found time to visit Stonehenge             and Shakespeare s birthplace             

Asimov with his second wife  Janet   They became a permanent feature of my face  and it is now difficult to believe early photographs that show me without sideburns                Photo by Jay Kay Klein  
Asimov was a teetotaler             
He was an able public speaker and was regularly invited to give talks about science in his distinct New York accent  He participated in many science fiction conventions  where he was friendly and approachable              He patiently answered tens of thousands of questions and other mail with postcards and was pleased to give autographs  He was of medium height         ft        in            m              and stocky build  In his later years  he adopted a signature style of  mutton chop  sideburns                          He took to wearing bolo ties after his wife Janet objected to his clip on bow ties              He never learned to swim or ride a bicycle  but did learn to drive a car after he moved to Boston  In his humor book Asimov Laughs Again  he describes Boston driving as  anarchy on wheels              
Asimov s wide interests included his participation in later years in organizations devoted to the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan              Many of his short stories mention or quote Gilbert and Sullivan              He was a prominent member of The Baker Street Irregulars  the leading Sherlock Holmes society              for whom he wrote an essay arguing that Professor Moriarty s work  The Dynamics of An Asteroid  involved the willful destruction of an ancient  civilized planet  He was also a member of the male only literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders  which served as the basis of his fictional group of mystery solvers  the Black Widowers              He later used his essay on Moriarty s work as the basis for a Black Widowers story   The Ultimate Crime   which appeared in More Tales of the Black Widowers                         
In       the American Humanist Association  AHA  named him the Humanist of the Year  He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto              From      until his death in       he served as honorary president of the AHA  and was succeeded by his friend and fellow writer Kurt Vonnegut  He was also a close friend of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry  and earned a screen credit as  special science consultant  on Star Trek  The Motion Picture for his advice during production             
Asimov was a founding member of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal  CSICOP  now the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry              and is listed in its Pantheon of Skeptics              In a discussion with James Randi at CSICon      regarding the founding of CSICOP  Kendrick Frazier said that Asimov was  a key figure in the Skeptical movement who is less well known and appreciated today  but was very much in the public eye back then   He said that Asimov s being associated with CSICOP  gave it immense status and authority  in his eyes                                     
Asimov described Carl Sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own  The other  he claimed  was the computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert Marvin Minsky              Asimov was an on and off member and honorary vice president of Mensa International  albeit reluctantly              he described some members of that organization as  brain proud and aggressive about their IQs                    i

He died in Manhattan on April          and was cremated               The cause of death was reported as heart and kidney failure                                         Ten years following Asimov s death  Janet and Robyn Asimov agreed that the HIV story should be made public  Janet revealed it in her edition of his autobiography  It s Been a Good Life                                                     

Writings edit 
 T he only thing about myself that I consider to be severe enough to warrant psychoanalytic treatment is my compulsion to write     That means that my idea of a pleasant time is to go up to my attic  sit at my electric typewriter  as I am doing right now   and bang away  watching the words take shape like magic before my eyes         Asimov

Asimov s career can be divided into several periods  His early career  dominated by science fiction  began with short stories in      and novels in       This lasted until about       all but ending after publication of The Naked Sun         He began publishing nonfiction as co author of a college level textbook called Biochemistry and Human Metabolism  Following the brief orbit of the first human made satellite Sputnik I by the USSR in       he wrote more nonfiction  particularly popular science books  and less science fiction  Over the next quarter century  he wrote only four science fiction novels  and     nonfiction books 
Starting in       the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of Foundation s Edge  From then until his death  Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels  tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated  making a unified series  There are many inconsistencies in this unification  especially in his earlier stories               Doubleday and Houghton Mifflin published about     of his work up to       Asimov stating that  both represent a father image              
Asimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his  Three Laws of Robotics  and the Foundation series               The Oxford English Dictionary credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words  robotics    positronic   an entirely fictional technology   and  psychohistory   which is also used for a different study on historical motivations   Asimov coined the term  robotics  without suspecting that it might be an original word  at the time  he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as mechanics and hydraulics  but for robots  Unlike his word  psychohistory   the word  robotics  continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov s original definition  Star Trek  The Next Generation featured androids with  positronic brains  and the first season episode  Datalore  called the positronic brain  Asimov s dream               
Asimov was so prolific and diverse in his writing that his books span all major categories of the Dewey Decimal Classification except for category      philosophy and psychology               However  he wrote several essays about psychology               and forewords for the books The Humanist Way        and In Pursuit of Truth                      which were classified in the    s category  but none of his own books were classified in that category              
According to UNESCO s Index Translationum database  Asimov is the world s   th most translated author              

Science fiction edit

Asimov became a science fiction fan in                    when he began reading the pulp magazines sold in his family s candy store               At first his father forbade reading pulps until Asimov persuaded him that because the science fiction magazines had  Science  in the title  they must be educational               At age    he joined the Futurians science fiction fan club  where he made friends who went on to become science fiction writers or editors              
Asimov began writing at the age of     imitating The Rover Boys with eight chapters of The Greenville Chums at College  His father bought him a used typewriter at age                 His first published work was a humorous item on the birth of his brother for Boys High School s literary journal in       In May      he first thought of writing professionally  and began writing his first science fiction story   Cosmic Corkscrew   now lost   that year  On May           puzzled by a change in the schedule of Astounding Science Fiction  Asimov visited its publisher Street  amp  Smith Publications  Inspired by the visit  he finished the story on June           and personally submitted it to Astounding editor John W  Campbell two days later  Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself  Two days later he received a detailed rejection letter               This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York  until moving to Boston in                   Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend              
By the end of the month  Asimov completed a second story   Stowaway   Campbell rejected it on July    but in  the nicest possible letter you could imagine  encouraged him to continue writing  promising that Asimov might sell his work after another year and a dozen stories of practice               On October           he sold the third story he finished   Marooned Off Vesta   to Amazing Stories  edited by Raymond A  Palmer  and it appeared in the March      issue  Asimov was paid      equivalent to            in        or one cent a word                           Two more stories appeared that year   The Weapon Too Dreadful to Use  in the May Amazing and  Trends  in the July Astounding  the issue fans later selected as the start of the Golden Age of Science Fiction              For       ISFDB catalogs seven stories in four different pulp magazines  including one in Astounding               His earnings became enough to pay for his education  but not yet enough for him to become a full time writer              
He later said that unlike other Golden Age writers Heinlein and A  E  van Vogt also first published in       and whose talent and stardom were immediately obvious Asimov   this is not false modesty  came up only gradually               Through July           Asimov wrote    stories in    months  of which    were published  he wrote in      that from that date he never wrote a science fiction story that was not published  except for two  special cases      j                     By      Asimov was famous enough that Donald Wollheim told him that he purchased  The Secret Sense  for a new magazine only because of his name               and the December      issue of Astonishing featuring Asimov s name in bold was the first magazine to base cover art on his work               but Asimov later said that neither he nor anyone else except perhaps Campbell considered him better than an often published  third rater               
Based on a conversation with Campbell  Asimov wrote  Nightfall   his   nd story  in March and April       and Astounding published it in September       In      the Science Fiction Writers of America voted  Nightfall  the best science fiction short story ever written                            In Nightfall and Other Stories Asimov wrote   The writing of  Nightfall  was a watershed in my professional career     I was suddenly taken seriously and the world of science fiction became aware that I existed  As the years passed  in fact  it became evident that I had written a  classic                  Nightfall  is an archetypal example of social science fiction  a term he created to describe a new trend in the     s  led by authors including him and Heinlein  away from gadgets and space opera and toward speculation about the human condition              
After writing  Victory Unintentional  in January and February       Asimov did not write another story for a year  He expected to make chemistry his career  and was paid        annually at the Philadelphia Navy Yard  enough to marry his girlfriend  he did not expect to make much more from writing than the           he had earned from the    stories he had already sold over four years  Asimov left science fiction fandom and no longer read new magazines  and might have left the writing profession had not Heinlein and de Camp been his coworkers at the Navy Yard and previously sold stories continued to appear              
In       Asimov published the first of his Foundation stories later collected in the Foundation trilogy  Foundation         Foundation and Empire         and Second Foundation         The books describe the fall of a vast interstellar empire and the establishment of its eventual successor  They feature his fictional science of psychohistory  whose theories could predict the future course of history according to dynamical laws regarding the statistical analysis of mass human actions              
Campbell raised his rate per word  Orson Welles purchased rights to  Evidence   and anthologies reprinted his stories  By the end of the war Asimov was earning as a writer an amount equal to half of his Navy Yard salary  even after a raise  but Asimov still did not believe that writing could support him  his wife  and future children                           
His  positronic  robot stories many of which were collected in I  Robot        were begun at about the same time  They promulgated a set of rules of ethics for robots  see Three Laws of Robotics  and intelligent machines that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject  Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection The Complete Robot        that he was largely inspired by the tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a Frankenstein plot in which they destroyed their creators  The Robot series has led to film adaptations  With Asimov s collaboration  in about       Harlan Ellison wrote a screenplay of I  Robot that Asimov hoped would lead to  the first really adult  complex  worthwhile science fiction film ever made   The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in       The      movie I  Robot  starring Will Smith  was based on an unrelated script by Jeff Vintar titled Hardwired  with Asimov s ideas incorporated later after the rights to Asimov s title were acquired                The title was not original to Asimov but had previously been used for a story by Eando Binder   Also  one of Asimov s robot short stories   The Bicentennial Man   was expanded into a novel The Positronic Man by Asimov and Robert Silverberg  and this was adapted into the      movie Bicentennial Man  starring Robin Williams             
In      the Foundation trilogy won the Hugo Award for the all time best series of science fiction and fantasy novels               and they along with the Robot series are his most famous science fiction  Besides movies  his Foundation and Robot stories have inspired other derivative works of science fiction literature  many by well known and established authors such as Roger MacBride Allen  Greg Bear  Gregory Benford  David Brin  and Donald Kingsbury  At least some of these appear to have been done with the blessing of  or at the request of  Asimov s widow  Janet Asimov                                        
In       he also wrote a spoof chemistry article   The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline   At the time  Asimov was preparing his own doctoral dissertation  which would include an oral examination  Fearing a prejudicial reaction from his graduate school evaluation board at Columbia University  Asimov asked his editor that it be released under a pseudonym  When it nevertheless appeared under his own name  Asimov grew concerned that his doctoral examiners might think he wasn t taking science seriously  At the end of the examination  one evaluator turned to him  smiling  and said   What can you tell us  Mr  Asimov  about the thermodynamic properties of the compound known as thiotimoline   Laughing hysterically with relief  Asimov had to be led out of the room  After a five minute wait  he was summoned back into the room and congratulated as  Dr  Asimov               
Demand for science fiction greatly increased during the     s  making it possible for a genre author to write full time               In       book publisher Doubleday s science fiction editor Walter I  Bradbury accepted Asimov s unpublished  Grow Old with Me          words   but requested that it be extended to a full novel of        words  The book appeared under the Doubleday imprint in January      with the title of Pebble in the Sky              Doubleday published five more original science fiction novels by Asimov in the     s  along with the six juvenile Lucky Starr novels  the latter under the pseudonym  Paul French                Doubleday also published collections of Asimov s short stories  beginning with The Martian Way and Other Stories in       The early     s also saw Gnome Press publish one collection of Asimov s positronic robot stories as I  Robot and his Foundation stories and novelettes as the three books of the Foundation trilogy  More positronic robot stories were republished in book form as The Rest of the Robots 
Book publishers and the magazines Galaxy and Fantasy  amp  Science Fiction ended Asimov s dependence on Astounding  He later described the era as his   mature  period   Asimov s  The Last Question          on the ability of humankind to cope with and potentially reverse the process of entropy  was his personal favorite story              
In       his stand alone novel The Gods Themselves was published to general acclaim  winning Best Novel in the Hugo               Nebula               and Locus Awards              
In December       former Beatle Paul McCartney approached Asimov and asked him to write the screenplay for a science fiction movie musical  McCartney had a vague idea for the plot and a small scrap of dialogue  about a rock band whose members discover they are being impersonated by extraterrestrials  The band and their impostors would likely be played by McCartney s group Wings  then at the height of their career  Though not generally a fan of rock music  Asimov was intrigued by the idea and quickly produced a treatment outline of the story adhering to McCartney s overall idea but omitting McCartney s scrap of dialogue  McCartney rejected it  and the treatment now exists only in the Boston University archives              
Asimov said in      that he had  the happiest of all my associations with science fiction magazines  with Fantasy  amp  Science Fiction   I have no complaints about Astounding  Galaxy  or any of the rest  heaven knows  but F amp SF has become something special to me                Beginning in       Asimov lent his name to Isaac Asimov s Science Fiction Magazine  now Asimov s Science Fiction  and wrote an editorial for each issue  There was also a short lived Asimov s SF Adventure Magazine and a companion Asimov s Science Fiction Anthology reprint series  published as magazines  in the same manner as the stablemates Ellery Queen s Mystery Magazine     s and Alfred Hitchcock s Mystery Magazine     s  anthologies                
Due to pressure by fans on Asimov to write another book in his Foundation series              he did so with Foundation s Edge        and Foundation and Earth         and then went back to before the original trilogy with Prelude to Foundation        and Forward the Foundation         his last novel 
He also helped Leonard Nimoy fleshing out the premise of the science fiction comic Primortals                          

Popular science edit 
Just say I am one of the most versatile writers in the world  and the greatest popularizer of many subjects         Asimov                  
Asimov and two colleagues published a textbook in       with two more editions by                   During the late     s and     s  Asimov substantially decreased his fiction output  he published only four adult novels between      s The Naked Sun and      s Foundation s Edge  two of which were mysteries   He greatly increased his nonfiction production  writing mostly on science topics  the launch of Sputnik in      engendered public concern over a  science gap                Asimov explained in The Rest of the Robots that he had been unable to write substantial fiction since the summer of       and observers understood him as saying that his fiction career had ended  or was permanently interrupted               Asimov recalled in      that  the United States went into a kind of tizzy  and so did I  I was overcome by the ardent desire to write popular science for an America that might be in great danger through its neglect of science  and a number of publishers got an equally ardent desire to publish popular science for the same reason               
Fantasy and Science Fiction invited Asimov to continue his regular nonfiction column  begun in the now folded bimonthly companion magazine Venture Science Fiction Magazine  The first of     monthly F amp SF columns appeared in November      and they continued until his terminal illness                   k      These columns  periodically collected into books by Doubleday              gave Asimov a reputation as a  Great Explainer  of science  he described them as his only popular science writing in which he never had to assume complete ignorance of the subjects on the part of his readers  The column was ostensibly dedicated to popular science but Asimov had complete editorial freedom  and wrote about contemporary social issues     citation needed      in essays such as  Thinking About Thinking               and  Knock Plastic                 In      he wrote of these essays   I get more pleasure out of them than out of any other writing assignment               
Asimov s first wide ranging reference work  The Intelligent Man s Guide to Science         was nominated for a National Book Award  and in      he won a Hugo Award his first for his essays for F amp SF               The popularity of his science books and the income he derived from them allowed him to give up most academic responsibilities and become a full time freelance writer               He encouraged other science fiction writers to write popular science  stating in      that  the knowledgeable  skillful science writer is worth his weight in contracts   with  twice as much work as he can possibly handle               
The great variety of information covered in Asimov s writings prompted Kurt Vonnegut to ask   How does it feel to know everything   Asimov replied that he only knew how it felt to have the  reputation  of omniscience   Uneasy                Floyd C  Gale said that  Asimov has a rare talent  He can make your mental mouth water over dry facts                and  science fiction s loss has been science popularization s gain                Asimov said that  Of all the writing I do  fiction  non fiction  adult  or juvenile  these F  amp  SF articles are by far the most fun                He regretted  however  that he had less time for fiction causing dissatisfied readers to send him letters of complaint stating in      that  In the last ten years  I ve done a couple of novels  some collections  a dozen or so stories  but that s nothing               
In his essay  To Tell a Chemist          Asimov proposed a simple shibboleth for distinguishing chemists from non chemists  ask the person to read the word  unionized   Chemists  he noted  will read un ionized  electrically neutral   while non chemists will read union ized  belonging to a trade union  

Coined terms edit 
Asimov coined the term  robotics  in his      story  Liar                 though he later remarked that he believed then that he was merely using an existing word  as he stated in Gold   The Robot Chronicles    While acknowledging the Oxford Dictionary reference  he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one third of the way down the first column of page     in the March      issue of Astounding Science Fiction   the printing of his short story  Runaround                            
In the same story  Asimov also coined the term  positronic   the counterpart to  electronic  for positrons               
Asimov coined the term  psychohistory  in his Foundation stories to name a fictional branch of science which combines history  sociology  and mathematical statistics to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people  such as the Galactic Empire  Asimov said later that he should have called it psychosociology  It was first introduced in the five short stories             which would later be collected as the      fix up novel Foundation               Somewhat later  the term  psychohistory  was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history                           

Other writings edit 
In addition to his interest in science  Asimov was interested in history  Starting in the     s  he wrote    popular history books  including The Greeks  A Great Adventure                      The Roman Republic                      The Roman Empire                      The Egyptians                     The Near East         Years of History                      and Asimov s Chronology of the World                     
He published Asimov s Guide to the Bible in two volumes covering the Old Testament in      and the New Testament in      and then combined them into one       page volume in       Complete with maps and tables  the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order  explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it  as well as biographical information about the important characters  His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works  including Asimov s Guide to Shakespeare             l      Asimov s Annotated Don Juan         Asimov s Annotated Paradise Lost         and The Annotated Gulliver s Travels                     
Asimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to Ellery Queen s Mystery Magazine  He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories  but soon moved on to writing  pure  mysteries  He published two full length mystery novels  and wrote    stories about the Black Widowers  a group of men who met monthly for dinner  conversation  and a puzzle  He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders  and all of the main characters  with the exception of the waiter  Henry  who he admitted resembled Wodehouse s Jeeves  were modeled after his closest friends               A parody of the Black Widowers   An Evening with the White Divorc s   was written by author  critic  and librarian Jon L  Breen               Asimov joked   all I can do     is to wait until I catch him in a dark alley  someday               
Toward the end of his life  Asimov published a series of collections of limericks  mostly written by himself  starting with Lecherous Limericks  which appeared in       Limericks  Too Gross  whose title displays Asimov s love of puns  contains     limericks by Asimov and an equal number by John Ciardi  He even created a slim volume of Sherlockian limericks  Asimov featured Yiddish humor in Azazel  The Two Centimeter Demon  The two main characters  both Jewish  talk over dinner  or lunch  or breakfast  about anecdotes of  George  and his friend Azazel  Asimov s Treasury of Humor is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on humor theory  According to Asimov  the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view  one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial  or from the sublime to the ridiculous                           
Particularly in his later years  Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher  In       as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as The Sensuous Woman  by  J   and The Sensuous Man  by  M    Asimov published The Sensuous Dirty Old Man under the byline  Dr   A                 although his full name was printed on the paperback edition  first published        However  by       Asimov s habit of groping women was seen as sexual harassment and came under criticism  and was cited as an early example of inappropriate behavior that can occur at science fiction conventions              
Asimov published three volumes of autobiography  In Memory Yet Green                     and In Joy Still Felt                     cover his life up to       The third volume  I  Asimov  A Memoir                      covered his whole life  rather than following on from where the second volume left off   The epilogue was written by his widow Janet Asimov after his death  The book won a Hugo Award in                    Janet Asimov edited It s Been a Good Life                      a condensed version of his three autobiographies  He also published three volumes of retrospectives of his writing  Opus                          Opus                          and Opus                         
In       the Asimovs co wrote How to Enjoy Writing  A Book of Aid and Comfort  In it they offer advice on how to maintain a positive attitude and stay productive when dealing with discouragement  distractions  rejection  and thick headed editors  The book includes many quotations  essays  anecdotes  and husband wife dialogues about the ups and downs of being an author                           
Asimov and Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry developed a unique relationship during Star Trek     s initial launch in the late     s  Asimov wrote a critical essay on Star Trek     s scientific accuracy for TV Guide magazine  Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series  Asimov corrected himself with a follow up essay to TV Guide claiming that despite its inaccuracies  Star Trek was a fresh and intellectually challenging science fiction television show  The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of Star Trek projects              

In       Asimov published a proposal for calendar reform  called the World Season Calendar  It divides the year into four seasons  named A D  of    weeks     days  each  This allows days to be named  e g    D     instead of December    due to December   being the   rd day of the  th quarter   An extra  year day  is added for a total of     days              

Awards and recognition edit 
Asimov won more than a dozen annual awards for particular works of science fiction and a half dozen lifetime awards

Writing style edit 
I have an informal style  which means I tend to use short words and simple sentence structure  to say nothing of occasional colloquialisms  This grates on people who like things that are poetic  weighty  complex  and  above all  obscure  On the other hand  the informal style pleases people who enjoy the sensation of reading an essay without being aware that they are reading and of feeling that ideas are flowing from the writer s brain into their own without mental friction         Asimov                   
Asimov was his own secretary  typist  indexer  proofreader  and literary agent              He wrote a typed first draft composed at the keyboard at    words per minute  he imagined an ending first  then a beginning  then  let everything in between work itself out as I come to it    Asimov used an outline only once  later describing it as  like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket    After correcting a draft by hand  he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor requested changes  a word processor did not save him much time  Asimov said  because     of the first draft was unchanged                                        
After disliking making multiple revisions of  Black Friar of the Flame   Asimov refused to make major  second  or non editorial revisions   like chewing used gum    stating that  too large a revision  or too many revisions  indicate that the piece of writing is a failure  In the time it would take to salvage such a failure  I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process   He submitted  failures  to another editor                           
Asimov s fiction style is extremely unornamented  In       science fiction scholar James Gunn wrote of I  Robot 

Except for two stories  Liar   and  Evidence  they are not stories in which character plays a significant part  Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action  Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind  The dialogue is  at best  functional and the style is  at best  transparent        The robot stories and  as a matter of fact  almost all Asimov fiction play themselves on a relatively bare stage              
Asimov addressed such criticism in      at the beginning of Nemesis 

I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing to be  clear   I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally  or in any of the other modes that might  if I were good enough  get me a Pulitzer prize  I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers  and the professional critics Well  they can do whatever they wish              
Gunn cited examples of a more complex style  such as the climax of  Liar    Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines  Susan Calvin in  Liar   and  Evidence   Arkady Darell in Second Foundation  Elijah Baley in The Caves of Steel  and Hari Seldon in the Foundation prequels 
Other than books by Gunn and Joseph Patrouch  there is relatively little literary criticism on Asimov  particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output   Cowart and Wymer s Dictionary of Literary Biography        gives a possible reason 

His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional literary criticism because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader  in rather direct terms  what is happening in his stories and why it is happening  In fact  most of the dialogue in an Asimov story  and particularly in the Foundation trilogy  is devoted to such exposition  Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted              
Gunn s and Patrouch s studies of Asimov both state that a clear  direct prose style is still a style  Gunn s      book comments in detail on each of Asimov s novels  He does not praise all of Asimov s fiction  nor does Patrouch   but calls some passages in The Caves of Steel  reminiscent of Proust   When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City  Gunn says that Asimov s prose  need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society               
Although he prided himself on his unornamented prose style  for which he credited Clifford D  Simak as an early influence                            and said in      that his style had not changed               Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated narrative structures  often by arranging chapters in nonchronological ways  Some readers have been put off by this  complaining that the nonlinearity is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story  For example  the first third of The Gods Themselves begins with Chapter    then backtracks to fill in earlier material                John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible  This advice helped Asimov create  Reason   one of the early Robot stories   Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of The Currents of Space did serious harm to that novel  to such an extent that only a  dyed in the kyrt              Asimov fan  could enjoy it  In his later novel Nemesis one group of characters lives in the  present  and another group starts in the  past   beginning    years earlier and gradually moving toward the time of the first group 

Alien life edit 
Asimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when Astounding     s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans  The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real world racial bias  Unwilling to write only weak alien races  and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell s friendship  he decided he would not write about aliens at all               Nevertheless  in response to these criticisms  he wrote The Gods Themselves  which contains aliens and alien sex  The book won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in                    and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in                    Asimov said that of all his writings  he was most proud of the middle section of The Gods Themselves  the part that deals with those themes              
In the Hugo Award winning novelette  Gold   Asimov describes an author  based on himself  who has one of his books  The Gods Themselves  adapted into a  compu drama   essentially photo realistic computer animation  The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov   Gregory Laborian   for having an extremely nonvisual style  making it difficult to adapt his work  and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across              

Romance and women edit 
In the early days of science fiction some authors and critics felt that the romantic elements were inappropriate in science fiction stories  which were supposedly to be focused on science and technology  Isaac Asimov was a supporter of this point of view  expressed in his           letters to Astounding  where he described such elements as  mush  and  slop   To his dismay  these letters were met with a strong opposition              
Asimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the  early imprinting  from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and  didn t know anything about girls                He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex  and of extraterrestrial life  in his science fiction  He claimed he wrote The Gods Themselves        to respond to these criticisms               which often came from New Wave science fiction  and often British  writers  The second part  of three  of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes  and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted 

Views edit 
There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author  The answer is   Not necessarily   And yet one ought to add another short phrase   but usually          Asimov                   
Religion edit 
Asimov was an atheist  and a humanist               He did not oppose religious conviction in others  but he frequently railed against superstitious and pseudoscientific beliefs that tried to pass themselves off as genuine science  During his childhood  his parents observed the traditions of Orthodox Judaism less stringently than they had in Petrovichi  they did not force their beliefs upon young Isaac  and  he grew up without strong religious influences  coming to believe that the Torah represented Hebrew mythology in the same way that the Iliad recorded Greek mythology               When he was     he chose not to have a bar mitzvah               As his books Treasury of Humor and Asimov Laughs Again record  Asimov was willing to tell jokes involving God  Satan  the Garden of Eden  Jerusalem  and other religious topics  expressing the viewpoint that a good joke can do more to provoke thought than hours of philosophical discussion                           
For a brief while  his father worked in the local synagogue to enjoy the familiar surroundings and  as Isaac put it   shine as a learned scholar               versed in the sacred writings  This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of Asimov s Guide to the Bible  an analysis of the historic foundations for the Old and New Testaments  For many years  Asimov called himself an atheist  he considered the term somewhat inadequate  as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did  Eventually  he described himself as a  humanist  and considered that term more practical  Asimov continued to identify himself as a secular Jew  as stated in his introduction to Jack Dann s anthology of Jewish science fiction  Wandering Stars   I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite  the Bar Mitzvah  It doesn t matter  I am Jewish               
When asked in an interview in      if he was an atheist  Asimov replied 

I am an atheist  out and out  It took me a long time to say it  I ve been an atheist for years and years  but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist  because it assumed knowledge that one didn t have  Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic  I finally decided that I m a creature of emotion as well as of reason  Emotionally I am an atheist  I don t have the evidence to prove that God doesn t exist  but I so strongly suspect he doesn t that I don t want to waste my time              
Likewise  he said about religious education   I would not be satisfied to have my kids choose to be religious without trying to argue them out of it  just as I would not be satisfied to have them decide to smoke regularly or engage in any other practice I consider detrimental to mind or body               
In his last volume of autobiography  Asimov wrote 

If I were not an atheist  I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words  I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God  God  God  and whose every deed is foul  foul  foul              
The same memoir states his belief that Hell is  the drooling dream of a sadist  crudely affixed to an all merciful God  if even human governments were willing to curtail cruel and unusual punishments  wondered Asimov  why would punishment in the afterlife not be restricted to a limited term  Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment  If an afterlife existed  he claimed  the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who  slandered God by inventing Hell               
Asimov said about using religious motifs in his writing 

I tend to ignore religion in my own stories altogether  except when I absolutely have to have it      and  whenever I bring in a religious motif  that religion is bound to seem vaguely Christian because that is the only religion I know anything about  even though it is not mine  An unsympathetic reader might think that I am  burlesquing  Christianity  but I am not  Then too  it is impossible to write science fiction and really ignore religion              
Politics edit 
Asimov became a staunch supporter of the Democratic Party during the New Deal  and thereafter remained a political liberal  He was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War in the     s and in a television interview during the early     s he publicly endorsed George McGovern               He was unhappy about what he considered an  irrationalist  viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late     s and onwards  In his second volume of autobiography  In Joy Still Felt  Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure Abbie Hoffman  Asimov s impression was that the     s  counterculture heroes had ridden an emotional wave which  in the end  left them stranded in a  no man s land of the spirit  from which he wondered if they would ever return              
Asimov vehemently opposed Richard Nixon  considering him  a crook and a liar   He closely followed Watergate  and was pleased when the president was forced to resign  Asimov was dismayed over the pardon extended to Nixon by his successor Gerald Ford   I was not impressed by the argument that it has spared the nation an ordeal  To my way of thinking  the ordeal was necessary to make certain it would never happen again               
After Asimov s name appeared in the mid     s on a list of people the Communist Party USA  considered amenable  to its goals  the FBI investigated him  Because of his academic background  the bureau briefly considered Asimov as a possible candidate for known Soviet spy ROBPROF  but found nothing suspicious in his life or background              
Asimov appeared to hold an equivocal attitude towards Israel  In his first autobiography  he indicates his support for the safety of Israel  though insisting that he was not a Zionist               In his third autobiography  Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state  on the grounds that he was opposed to having nation states in general  and supported the notion of a single humanity  Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among Muslim neighbors  who will never forgive  never forget and never go away   and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another  Jewish ghetto       n     

Social issues edit 
Asimov believed that  science fiction     serve s  the good of humanity                He considered himself a feminist even before women s liberation became a widespread movement  he argued that the issue of women s rights was closely connected to that of population control               Furthermore  he believed that homosexuality must be considered a  moral right  on population grounds  as must all consenting adult sexual activity that does not lead to reproduction               He issued many appeals for population control  reflecting a perspective articulated by people from Thomas Malthus through Paul R  Ehrlich              
In a      interview by Bill Moyers  Asimov proposed computer aided learning  where people would use computers to find information on subjects in which they were interested               He thought this would make learning more interesting  since people would have the freedom to choose what to learn  and would help spread knowledge around the world  Also  the one to one model would let students learn at their own pace               Asimov thought that people would live in space by                   
In      Asimov wrote              

Computerization will undoubtedly continue onward inevitably   
This means that a vast change in the nature of education must take place  and entire populations must be made  computer literate  and must be taught to deal with a  high tech  world 
He continues on education  Education  which must be revolutionized in the new world  will be revolutionized by the very agency that requires the revolution   the computer 
Schools will undoubtedly still exist  but a good schoolteacher can do no better than to inspire curiosity which an interested student can then satisfy at home at the console of his computer outlet 
There will be an opportunity finally for every youngster  and indeed  every person  to learn what he or she wants to learn  in his or her own time  at his or her own speed  in his or her own way 

Education will become fun because it will bubble up from within and not be forced in from without 
Sexual harassment edit 
Asimov would often fondle  kiss and pinch women at conventions and elsewhere without regard for their consent  According to Alec Nevala Lee  author of an Asimov biography               and writer on the history of science fiction  he often defended himself by saying that far from showing objections  these women cooperated               In a      satirical piece  The Sensuous Dirty Old Man  Asimov wrote   The question then is not whether or not a girl should be touched  The question is merely where  when  and how she should be touched               
According to Nevala Lee  however   many of these encounters were clearly nonconsensual                He wrote that Asimov s behaviour  as a leading science fiction author and personality  contributed to an undesirable atmosphere for women in the male dominated science fiction community  In support of this  he quoted some of Asimov s contemporary fellow authors such as Judith Merril  Harlan Ellison and Frederik Pohl  as well as editors such as Timothy Seldes               Additional specific incidents were reported by other people including Edward L  Ferman  long time editor of The Magazine of Fantasy  amp  Science Fiction  who wrote     instead of shaking my date s hand  he shook her left breast               

Environment and population edit 
Asimov s defense of civil applications of nuclear power  even after the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant incident  damaged his relations with some of his fellow liberals  In a letter reprinted in Yours  Isaac Asimov               he states that although he would prefer living in  no danger whatsoever  to living near a nuclear reactor  he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant to a slum on Love Canal or near  a Union Carbide plant producing methyl isocyanate   the latter being a reference to the Bhopal disaster              
In the closing years of his life  Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the middle class flight to the suburbs  though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs  His last nonfiction book  Our Angry Earth        co written with his long time friend  science fiction author Frederik Pohl   deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as overpopulation  oil dependence  war  global warming  and the destruction of the ozone layer                            In response to being presented by Bill Moyers with the question  What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate    Asimov responded 

It s going to destroy it all     if you have    people in the apartment and two bathrooms  no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom  there is no such thing  You have to set up  you have to set up times for each person  you have to bang at the door  aren t you through yet  and so on  And in the same way  democracy cannot survive overpopulation  Human dignity cannot survive it  Convenience and decency cannot survive it  As you put more and more people onto the world  the value of life not only declines  but it disappears              
Other authors edit 
Asimov enjoyed the writings of J  R  R  Tolkien  and used The Lord of the Rings as a plot point in a Black Widowers story  titled Nothing like Murder               In the essay  All or Nothing   for The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction  Jan        Asimov said that he admired Tolkien and that he had read The Lord of the Rings five times   The feelings were mutual  with Tolkien saying that he had enjoyed Asimov s science fiction               This would make Asimov an exception to Tolkien s earlier claim              that he rarely found  any modern books  that were interesting to him  
He acknowledged other writers as superior to himself in talent  saying of Harlan Ellison   He is  in my opinion  one of the best writers in the world  far more skilled at the art than I am                Asimov disapproved of the New Wave s growing influence  stating in       I want science fiction  I think science fiction isn t really science fiction if it lacks science  And I think the better and truer the science  the better and truer the science fiction               
The feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and Arthur C  Clarke were demonstrated by the so called  Clarke Asimov Treaty of Park Avenue   negotiated as they shared a cab in New York  This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world  reserving second best for himself   while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world  reserving second best for himself   Thus  the dedication in Clarke s book Report on Planet Three        reads   In accordance with the terms of the Clarke Asimov treaty  the second best science writer dedicates this book to the second best science fiction writer  
In       Asimov wrote a highly critical review of George Orwell s                    Though dismissive of his attacks  James Machell has stated that they  are easier to understand when you consider that Asimov viewed      as dangerous literature  He opines that if communism were to spread across the globe  it would come in a completely different form to the one in       and by looking to Orwell as an authority on totalitarianism   we will be defending ourselves against assaults from the wrong direction and we will lose                
Asimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction  He preferred to read the former because  I read every  science fiction  story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine  in which case I had no patience with it  or that it might be better  in which case I felt miserable                Asimov wrote  I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use Agatha Christie as my model  In my opinion  her mysteries are the best ever written  far better than the Sherlock Holmes stories  and Hercule Poirot is the best detective fiction has seen  Why should I not use as my model what I consider the best                He enjoyed Sherlock Holmes  but considered Arthur Conan Doyle to be  a slapdash and sloppy writer               
Asimov also enjoyed humorous stories  particularly those of P  G  Wodehouse              
In non fiction writing  Asimov particularly admired the writing style of Martin Gardner  and tried to emulate it in his own science books  On meeting Gardner for the first time in       Asimov told him this  to which Gardner answered that he had based his own style on Asimov s              

Influence edit 
Paul Krugman  holder of a Nobel Prize in Economics  stated Asimov s concept of psychohistory inspired him to become an economist              
John Jenkins  who has reviewed the vast majority of Asimov s written output  once observed   It has been pointed out that most science fiction writers since the     s have been affected by Asimov  either modeling their style on his or deliberately avoiding anything like his style                Along with such figures as Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper  Asimov left his mark as one of the most distinguished interdisciplinarians of the   th century                Few individuals   writes James L  Christian   understood better than Isaac Asimov what synoptic thinking is all about  His almost     books which he wrote as a specialist  a knowledgeable authority  or just an excited layman range over almost all conceivable subjects  the sciences  history  literature  religion  and of course  science fiction               
In       DARPA named one of its programs after Asimov  inspired by his  Three Laws of Robotics   The program   Autonomy Standards and Ideals with Military Operational Values  ASIMOV   aims to develop benchmarks objectively and quantitatively assessing the ethical challenges and readiness of utilizing autonomous systems for military operations

  a b c Asimov  Isaac         In Memory Yet Green  p           The date of my birth  as I celebrate it  was January          It could not have been later than that  It might  however  have been earlier  Allowing for the uncertainties of the times  of the lack of records  of the Jewish and Julian calendars  it might have been as early as October          There is  however  no way of finding out  My parents were always uncertain and it really doesn t matter  I celebrate January          so let it be 

  In the humorous poem  The Prime of Life  published in the anthology The Bicentennial Man and Other Stories  p      Asimov rhymes his name thusly   Why  mazel tov  it s Asimov   In his comments on the poem  Asimov wrote that originally it was  Why  stars above  it s Asimov   and when someone suggested to use  mazel tov  instead  Asimov accepted this as a significant improvement 

  Russian                pronounced       s  ak   z im f       Yiddish                 romanized       Yitskhok Azimov            

  Asimov  Stanley         Yours  Isaac Asimov  My estimate is that Isaac received about         letters in his professional career  And with the compulsiveness that has to be a character trait of a writer of almost     books  he answered    percent of them  He answered more than half with postcards and didn t make carbons of them  But with the         letters he received  there are carbons of about        that he wrote 

  He obtained his Ph D  on May                       He wrote a dissertation on  Kinetics of the Reaction Inactivation of Tyrosinase During Its Catalysis of the Aerobic Oxidation of Catechol               An abridged version was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society              February       p       online at the JACS website               subscription required     The introduction to the full dissertation was reprinted in his book Opus      pp           

  He had entered the army on November                     

  Between      and      he published seven scientific research papers  the summary of his PhD dissertation  described in an earlier explanatory note   which he described as  my longest and my best   and six papers about his research at Boston University   all those papers were unimportant               

  Asimov  Isaac         Nightfall  and Other Stories  Doubleday  p            I wrote a novel in      which pictured a world in which everyone lived in underground cities  comfortably enclosed away from the open air  People would say   How could you imagine such a nightmarish situation   And I would answer in astonishment   What nightmarish situation  

  On the subject of IQ tests  Asimov wrote   there is no objective definition of intelligence  and what we call intelligence is only a creation of cultural fashion and subjective prejudice                and  I simply don t think it is reasonable to use IQ tests to produce results of questionable value  which may then serve to justify racists in their own minds and to help bring about the kinds of tragedies we have already witnessed earlier in this century               

  The two exceptions were both       word short stories written in        Masks  and  Big Game                The latter was published in                   

  A    th essay  a compilation of excerpts from his earlier essays edited by his widow Janet Jeppson Asimov  was published in the magazine in      

  Asimov  In Joy Still Felt         pp            Of all the books I have ever worked on  I think Asimov s Guide to Shakespeare gave me the most pleasure  day in  day out  For months and months I lived and thought Shakespeare  and I don t see how there can be any greater pleasure in the world any pleasure  that is  that one can indulge in for as much as ten hours without pause  day after day indefinitely  

  Reprinted as  The Birth and Death of the Universe  in Is Anyone There   Doubleday       

  Asimov  Isaac         I  Asimov  A Memoir  New York  Doubleday  p            When Israel was founded in      and all my Jewish friends were jubilant  I was the skeleton at the feast  I said   We are building ourselves a ghetto  We will be surrounded by tens of millions of Muslims who will never forgive  never forget and never go away      But don t Jews deserve a homeland  Actually  I feel that no human group deserves a  homeland  in the usual sense of the word      I am not a Zionist  then  because I don t believe in nations  and Zionism merely sets up one more nation to trouble the world
