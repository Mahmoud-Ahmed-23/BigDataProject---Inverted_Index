More than    countries  including the EU member states  have endorsed the Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence            


Background edit 
The development of the Framework Convention on AI emerged in response to growing concerns over the ethical  legal  and societal impacts of artificial intelligence  The Council of Europe  which has historically played a key role in setting human rights standards across Europe  initiated discussions on AI governance in       leading to the drafting of a binding legal framework  
The process of creating the Framework Convention began in      with the ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence  CAHAI  assessing the feasibility of the instrument  In       the Committee on Artificial Intelligence  CAI  took over the process  drafting and negotiating the text of the Convention            
The treaty is designed to complement existing international human rights instruments  including the European Convention on Human Rights and the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data 

Structure and content edit 
The Convention establishes fundamental principles for AI governance  including transparency  accountability  non discrimination  and human rights protection through eight chapters and    articles  Adopted in       this landmark treaty addresses AI governance through seven core principles and detailed implementation mechanisms             It mandates risk and impact assessments to mitigate potential harms and provides safeguards such as the right to challenge AI driven decisions  It applies to public authorities and private entities acting on their behalf but excludes national security and defense activities  Implementation is overseen by a Conference of the Parties  ensuring compliance and international cooperation 
Activities within the AI system lifecycle must adhere to seven fundamental principles  ensuring compliance with human rights  democracy  and the rule of law  The treaty also establishes remedies  procedural rights and safeguards  and risk and impact management requirements to promote accountability  transparency  and responsible AI development            
The treaty consists of five chapters  Chapter I contains general provisions  Chapter II states the general obligation to protect human rights and the integrity of democratic processes and respect of the rule of law  The main principles and rights are contained in Chapter III  which consists of Articles   to     Chapter IV  Articles    to     sets up the legal remedies  Chapter V states the risk and impact management framework  Chapter VI facilitates the implementation criteria of the treaty  Chapter VII sets the co operation and oversight mechanisms  Chapter VIII contains various concluding clauses            
Article   declares the objectives of the treaty  to ensure that activities within the lifecycle of artificial intelligence systems are fully consistent with human rights  democracy and the rule of law            

Entry into force edit 
The treaty will enter into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of three months after the date on which five ratification made by five countries  including three member states of the Council of Europe                       

Competing approaches edit 
While the CoE s AI Convention represents a multilateral effort to regulate AI through a human rights based approach  alternative frameworks have also been proposed  One notable example is the Munich Draft for a Convention on AI  Data and Human Rights  an initiative led by legal scholars and policymakers in Germany             The Munich Draft advocates for stronger safeguards against AI related risks  emphasizing stricter data protection measures  accountability for AI developers  and explicit prohibitions on high risk AI applications  such as mass surveillance and autonomous lethal weapons  Unlike the CoE convention  which focuses on balancing innovation with regulation  the Munich Draft takes a more precautionary stance  calling for tighter controls over AI deployment in sensitive domains 
Other competing international efforts include the OECD s AI Principles  the GPAI  Global Partnership on AI   and the European Union s AI Act  each of which offers different regulatory strategies to govern AI at regional and global levels
