Early life and education edit 
David Chalmers was born in Sydney  New South Wales  and subsequently grew up in Adelaide  South Australia  where he attended Unley High School            
As a child  he experienced synesthesia             He began coding and playing computer games at the age of    on a PDP    at a medical center             He also performed exceptionally in mathematics  and secured a bronze medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad             When Chalmers was     he read Douglas Hofstadter s      book G del  Escher  Bach  which awakened an interest in philosophy            
Chalmers received his undergraduate degree in pure mathematics from the University of Adelaide              After graduating Chalmers spent six months reading philosophy books while hitchhiking across Europe              before continuing his studies at the University of Oxford              where he was a Rhodes Scholar but eventually withdrew from the course             
In       Chalmers received his PhD in philosophy and cognitive science from Indiana University Bloomington under Douglas Hofstadter              writing a doctoral thesis entitled Toward a Theory of Consciousness              He was a postdoctoral fellow in the Philosophy Neuroscience Psychology program directed by Andy Clark at Washington University in St  Louis from      to                              

Career edit 
In       Chalmers presented a lecture at the inaugural Toward a Science of Consciousness conference              According to the Chronicle of Higher Education  this  lecture established Chalmers as a thinker to be reckoned with and goosed a nascent field into greater prominence               He went on to co organize the conference  renamed  The Science of Consciousness   for some years with Stuart Hameroff  but stepped away when he felt it became too divergent from mainstream science              Chalmers is a founding member of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness and one of its past presidents             
Having established his reputation  Chalmers received his first professorship at UC Santa Cruz  from August      to December       In      he published the widely cited book The Conscious Mind  Chalmers was subsequently appointed Professor of Philosophy             and then Director of the Center for Consciousness Studies             at the University of Arizona                          In       Chalmers returned to Australia  encouraged by an ARC Federation Fellowship  becoming professor of philosophy and director of the Center for Consciousness at the Australian National University              Chalmers accepted a part time professorship at the philosophy department of New York University in       becoming a full time professor in                  
In       Chalmers was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts  amp  Sciences             He is an editor on topics in the philosophy of mind for the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy              In May       it was announced that he would serve on the jury for the Berggruen Prize             
In       Chalmers won a bet made in       for a case of wine with neuroscientist Christof Koch that the neural underpinnings for consciousness would not be resolved by the year       while Koch had bet that they would             

Philosophical work edit 
Philosophy of mind edit

Chalmers is best known for formulating what he calls the  hard problem of consciousness   in both his      paper  Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness  and his      book The Conscious Mind  He makes a distinction between  easy  problems of consciousness  such as explaining object discrimination or verbal reports  and the single hard problem  which could be stated  why does the feeling which accompanies awareness of sensory information exist at all   The essential difference between the  cognitive  easy problems and the  phenomenal  hard problem is that the former are at least theoretically answerable via the dominant strategy in the philosophy of mind  physicalism  Chalmers argues for an  explanatory gap  from the objective to the subjective  and criticizes physicalist explanations of mental experience  making him a dualist  Chalmers characterizes his view as  naturalistic dualism   naturalistic because he believes mental states supervene  naturally  on physical systems  such as brains   dualist because he believes mental states are ontologically distinct from and not reducible to physical systems  He has also characterized his view by more traditional formulations such as property dualism             
In support of this  Chalmers is famous for his commitment to the logical  though  not natural  possibility of philosophical zombies              These zombies are complete physical duplicates of human beings  lacking only qualitative experience  Chalmers argues that since such zombies are conceivable to us  they must therefore be logically possible  Since they are logically possible  then qualia and sentience are not fully explained by physical properties alone  the facts about them are further facts  Instead  Chalmers argues that consciousness is a fundamental property ontologically autonomous of any known  or even possible  physical properties              and that there may be lawlike rules which he terms  psychophysical laws  that determine which physical systems are associated with which types of qualia   He further speculates that all information bearing systems may be conscious  leading him to entertain the possibility of conscious thermostats and a qualified panpsychism he calls panprotopsychism  Chalmers maintains a formal agnosticism on the issue  even conceding that the viability of panpsychism places him at odds with the majority of his contemporaries  According to Chalmers  his arguments are similar to a line of thought that goes back to Leibniz s       mill  argument  the first substantial use of philosophical  zombie  terminology may be Robert Kirk s       Zombies vs  Materialists              
After the publication of Chalmers s landmark paper  more than twenty papers in response were published in the Journal of Consciousness Studies   These papers  by Daniel Dennett  Colin McGinn  Francisco Varela  Francis Crick  and Roger Penrose  among others  were collected and published in the book Explaining Consciousness  The Hard Problem              John Searle critiqued Chalmers s views in The New York Review of Books                         
With Andy Clark  Chalmers has written  The Extended Mind   an article about the borders of the mind             
According to Chalmers  systems that have the same functional organization  at a fine enough grain   that are  functionally isomorphic   will have  qualitatively identical conscious experiences   In       he proposed the reductio ad absurdum  fading qualia  thought experiment  It involves progressively replacing each neuron of a brain with a functional equivalent  for example implemented on a silicon chip  Since each substitute neuron performs the same function as the original  the subject would not notice any change  But  Chalmers argues  if qualia  for example  the perceived color of objects  were to fade or disappear  the brain s holder could notice the difference  which would alter the information processing in the brain  leading to a contradiction  He concludes that such fading qualia are impossible in practice  and that after each neuron is replaced  the resulting functionally isomorphic robotic brain would be as conscious as the original biological one  In addition  Chalmers proposed a similar thought experiment   dancing qualia   which concludes that a robotic brain that is functionally isomorphic to a biological one would not only be as conscious  but would also have the same conscious experiences  e g   the same perception of color when seeing an object                           In       he analyzed whether large language models could be conscious  and suggested that they were probably not conscious  but could become serious candidates for consciousness within a decade             

Philosophy of language edit 
Chalmers has published works on the  theory of reference  concerning how words secure their referents  He  together with others such as Frank Jackson  played a major role in developing two dimensional semantics             

Background edit 
Before Saul Kripke delivered his famous lecture series Naming and Necessity in       the descriptivism advocated by Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell was the orthodoxy  Descriptivism suggests that a name is an abbreviation of a description  which is a set of properties  This name secures its reference by a process of properties fitting  whichever object fits the description most  is the referent of the name  Therefore  the description provides the sense of the name  and it is through this sense that the reference of the name is determined             
However  as Kripke argued in Naming and Necessity  a name does not secure its reference via any process of description fitting  Rather  a name determines its reference via a historical causal link tracing back to the process of naming  And thus  Kripke thinks that a name does not have a sense  or  at least  does not have a sense which is rich enough to play the reference determining role  Moreover  a name  in Kripke s view  is a rigid designator  which refers to the same object in all possible worlds  Following this line of thought  Kripke suggests that any scientific identity statement such as  Water is H O  is also a necessary statement  i e  true in all possible worlds  Kripke thinks that this is a phenomenon that descriptivism cannot explain             
And  as also proposed by Hilary Putnam and Kripke himself  Kripke s view on names can also be applied to the reference of natural kind terms  The kind of theory of reference that is advocated by Kripke and Putnam is called the direct reference theory             

Two dimensional semantics edit 
Chalmers disagrees with Kripke  and direct reference theorists in general  He thinks that there are two kinds of intension of a natural kind term  a stance called two dimensionalism  For example  the statement  Water is H O  expresses two distinct propositions  often referred to as a primary intension and a secondary intension  which together form its meaning                         
The primary intension of a word or sentence is its sense  i e   is the idea or method by which we find its referent  The primary intension of  water  might be a description  such as  the substance with water like properties   The entity identified by this intension could vary in different hypothetical worlds  In the twin Earth thought experiment  for example  inhabitants might use  water  to mean their equivalent of water  even if its chemical composition is not H O  Thus  for that world   water  does not refer to H O             
The secondary intension of  water  is whatever  water  refers to in this world  When considered according to its secondary intension  water means H O in every world  Through this concept  Chalmers provides a way to explain how reference is determined by distinguishing between epistemic possibilities  primary intension  and metaphysical necessities  secondary intension   ensuring that the referent  H O  is uniquely identified across all metaphysically possible worlds             

Philosophy of verbal disputes edit 
In some more recent work  Chalmers has concentrated on verbal disputes              He argues that a dispute is best characterized as  verbal  when it concerns some sentence S which contains a term T such that  i  the parties to the dispute disagree over the meaning of T  and  ii  the dispute arises solely because of this disagreement  In the same work  Chalmers proposes certain procedures for the resolution of verbal disputes  One of these he calls the  elimination method   which involves eliminating the contentious term and observing whether any dispute remains 

Technology and virtual reality edit 
Chalmers addressed the issue of virtual and non virtual worlds in his      book Reality   While Chalmers recognises that virtual reality is not the same as non virtual reality  he does not consider virtual reality to be an illusion  but rather a  genuine reality  in its own right              Chalmers sees virtual reality as potentially offering as meaningful a life as non virtual reality              and argues that we could already be inhabitants of a simulation without knowing it             
Chalmers proposes that computers are forming a form of  exo cortex   where a part of human cognition is  outsourced  to corporations such as Apple and Google             
Chalmers was featured in the      documentary film entitled The Singularity by filmmaker Doug Wolens  which focuses on the theory proposed by techno futurist Ray Kurzweil  of that  point in time when computer intelligence exceeds human intelligence                           He was a featured philosopher in the      Daily Nous series on GPT    which he described as  one of the most interesting and important AI systems ever produced              

Personal life edit 
As of          update      Chalmers was the lead singer of the Zombie Blues band  which performed at the music festival Qualia Fest in      in New York             
Regarding religion  Chalmers said in        I have no religious views myself and no spiritual views  except watered down humanistic spiritual views  And consciousness is just a fact of life  It s a natural fact of life
