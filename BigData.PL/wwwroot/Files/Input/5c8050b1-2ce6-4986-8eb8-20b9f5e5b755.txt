An AI Safety Institute  AISI   in general  is a state backed institute aiming to evaluate and ensure the safety of the most advanced artificial intelligence  AI  models  also called frontier AI models            
AI safety gained prominence in       notably with public declarations about potential existential risks from AI  During the AI Safety Summit in November       the United Kingdom  UK  and the United States  US  both created their own AISI  During the AI Seoul Summit in May       international leaders agreed to form a network of AI Safety Institutes  comprising institutes from the UK  the US  Japan  France  Germany  Italy  Singapore  South Korea  Australia  Canada and the European Union            


Timeline edit 
In       Rishi Sunak  the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom  expressed his intention to  make the U K  not just the intellectual home but the geographical home of global AI safety regulation  and unveiled plans for an AI Safety Summit             He emphasized the need for independent safety evaluations  stating that AI companies cannot  mark their own homework              During the summit in November       the UK AISI was officially established as an evolution of the Frontier AI Taskforce             and the US AISI as part of the NIST  Japan followed by launching an AI safety institute in February                 
Politico reported in April      that many AI companies had not shared pre deployment access to their most advanced AI models for evaluation  Meta s president of global affairs Nick Clegg said that many AI companies were waiting for the UK and the US AI Safety Institutes to work out common evaluation rules and procedures             An agreement was indeed concluded between the UK and the US in April      to collaborate on at least one joint safety test             Initially established in London  the UK AI Safety Institute announced in May      that it would open an office in San Francisco  where many AI companies are located  This is part of a plan to  set new  international standards on AI safety   according to UK s technology minister Michele Donelan                        
At the AI Seoul Summit in May       the European Union and other countries agreed to create their own AI safety institutes  forming an international network            

United Kingdom edit 
The United Kingdom founded in April      a safety organisation called Frontier AI Taskforce  with an initial budget of      million              In November       it evolved into the UK AISI  and continued to be led by Ian Hogarth  The AISI is part of the United Kingdom s Department for Science  Innovation and Technology            
The United Kingdom s AI strategy aims to balance safety and innovation  Unlike the European Union which adopted the AI Act  the UK is reluctant to legislate early  considering that it may lower the sector s growth  and that laws might be rendered obsolete by technological progress            
In May       the institute open sourced an AI safety tool called  Inspect   which evaluates AI model capabilities such as reasoning and their degree of autonomy             

United States edit 
The US AISI was founded in November      as part of the NIST  This happened the day after the signature of the Executive Order                    In February       Joe Biden s former economic policy adviser Elizabeth Kelly was appointed to lead it             
In February       the US government created the US AI Safety Institute Consortium  AISIC   regrouping more than     organizations such as Google  Anthropic or Microsoft             
In March       a budget of     million was allocated              Observers noted that this investment is relatively small  especially considering the presence of many big AI companies in the US  The NIST itself  which hosts the AISI  is also known for its chronic lack of funding                         Biden administration s request for additional funding was met with further budget cuts from congressional appropriators                         

India edit 
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology held consultations with  Meta Platforms  Google  Microsoft  IBM  OpenAI  NASSCOM  Broadband India Forum  Software Alliance  Indian Institutes of Technology  The Quantum Hub  Digital Empowerment Foundation  and Access Now on October          in relation to the establishment of the AI Safety Institute  The decision was made to shift focus from regulation to standards setting  risk identification  and damage detection all of which require interoperable technologies  The AISI may spend the     crore allotted to the Safe and Trusted Pillar of the IndiaAI Mission for the initial budget  Future funding may come from other components of the IndiaAI Mission                         
UNESCO and MeitY began consulting on AI Readiness Assessment Methodology under Safety and Ethics in Artificial Intelligence from       It is to encourage the ethical and responsible use of AI in industries  The study will find areas where government can become involved  especially in attempts to strengthen institutional and regulatory capabilities                         
Minister for Electronics  amp  Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw announced the creation of an IndiaAI Safety Institute on January           to ensure the ethical and safe application of AI models  The institute will promote domestic R amp D that is grounded in India s social  economic  cultural  and linguistic diversity and is based on Indian datasets  With the help of academic and research institutions  as well as private sector partners  the institute will follow the hub and spoke approach to carry out projects within Safe and Trusted Pillar of the IndiaAI Mission
