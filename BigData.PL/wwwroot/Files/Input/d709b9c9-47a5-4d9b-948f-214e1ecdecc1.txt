Building or room used to house computer servers and related equipment


ARSAT data center       
A data center is a building  a dedicated space within a building  or a group of buildings            used to house computer systems and associated components  such as telecommunications and storage systems                       
Since IT operations are crucial for business continuity  it generally includes redundant or backup components and infrastructure for power supply  data communication connections  environmental controls  e g   air conditioning  fire suppression   and various security devices  A large data center is an industrial scale operation using as much electricity as a medium town             Estimated global data center electricity consumption in      was         TWh  or roughly        of global electricity demand  This excludes energy used for cryptocurrency mining  which was estimated to be around     TWh in       or another      of global electricity demand             The IEA projects that data center electric use could double between      and                  High demand for electricity from data centers  including by cryptomining and artificial intelligence  has also increased strain on local electric grids and increased electricity prices in some markets 
Data centers can vary widely in terms of size  power requirements  redundancy  and overall structure  Four common categories used to segment types of data centers are onsite data centers  colocation facilities  hyperscale data centers  and edge data centers            


History edit 
NASA mission control computer room c      
Data centers have their roots in the huge computer rooms of the     s  typified by ENIAC  one of the earliest examples of a data center                 note        Early computer systems  complex to operate and maintain  required a special environment in which to operate  Many cables were necessary to connect all the components  and methods to accommodate and organize these were devised such as standard racks to mount equipment  raised floors  and cable trays  installed overhead or under the elevated floor   A single mainframe required a great deal of power and had to be cooled to avoid overheating  Security became important        computers were expensive  and were often used for military purposes                 note        Basic design guidelines for controlling access to the computer room were therefore devised 
During the microcomputer industry boom of the     s  users started to deploy computers everywhere  in many cases with little or no care about operating requirements  However  as information technology  IT  operations started to grow in complexity  organizations grew aware of the need to control IT resources  The availability of inexpensive networking equipment  coupled with new standards for the network structured cabling  made it possible to use a hierarchical design that put the servers in a specific room inside the company  The use of the term data center  as applied to specially designed computer rooms  started to gain popular recognition about this time                 note       
A boom of data centers came during the dot com bubble of                           note        Companies needed fast Internet connectivity and non stop operation to deploy systems and to establish a presence on the Internet  Installing such equipment was not viable for many smaller companies  Many companies started building very large facilities  called internet data centers  IDCs               which provide enhanced capabilities  such as crossover backup   If a Bell Atlantic line is cut  we can transfer them to     to minimize the time of outage              
The term cloud data centers  CDCs  has been used              Increasingly  the division of these terms has almost disappeared and they are being integrated into the term data center             
The global data center market saw steady growth in the     s  with a notable acceleration in the latter half of the decade  According to Gartner  worldwide data center infrastructure spending reached      billion in       representing a    increase from      despite the economic challenges posed by the COVID    pandemic             
The latter part of the     s and early     s saw a significant shift towards AI and machine learning applications  generating a global boom for more powerful and efficient data center infrastructure  As of March       global data creation was projected to grow to more than     zettabytes by       up from      zettabytes in                  
The United States is currently the foremost leader in data center infrastructure  hosting       data centers as of March       the highest number of any country worldwide              According to global consultancy McKinsey  amp  Co   U S  market demand is expected to double to    gigawatts  GW  by       up from    GW in                   As of       the U S  accounts for roughly    percent of the global market             
A study published by the Electric Power Research Institute  EPRI  in May      estimates U S  data center power consumption could range from      to      of the country s generation by                   As of       about     of U S  data center load was concentrated in    states  led by Virginia and Texas             

Requirements for modern data centers edit 
Racks of telecommunications equipment in part of a data center
Modernization and data center transformation enhances performance and energy efficiency             
Information security is also a concern  and for this reason  a data center has to offer a secure environment that minimizes the chances of a security breach  A data center must  therefore  keep high standards for assuring the integrity and functionality of its hosted computer environment 
Industry research company International Data Corporation  IDC  puts the average age of a data center at nine years old              Gartner  another research company  says data centers older than seven years are obsolete              The growth in data      zettabytes by                   is one factor driving the need for data centers to modernize 
Focus on modernization is not new  concern about obsolete equipment was decried in                   and in      Uptime Institute was concerned about the age of the equipment therein      note        By      concern had shifted once again  this time to the age of the staff   data center staff are aging faster than the equipment              

Meeting standards for data centers edit 
The Telecommunications Industry Association s Telecommunications Infrastructure Standard for Data Centers             specifies the minimum requirements for telecommunications infrastructure of data centers and computer rooms including single tenant enterprise data centers and multi tenant Internet hosting data centers  The topology proposed in this document is intended to be applicable to any size data center             
Telcordia GR       NEBS Requirements for Telecommunications Data Center Equipment and Spaces              provides guidelines for data center spaces within telecommunications networks  and environmental requirements for the equipment intended for installation in those spaces  These criteria were developed jointly by Telcordia and industry representatives  They may be applied to data center spaces housing data processing or Information Technology  IT  equipment  The equipment may be used to 

Operate and manage a carrier s telecommunication network
Provide data center based applications directly to the carrier s customers
Provide hosted applications for a third party to provide services to their customers
Provide a combination of these and similar data center applications
Data center transformation edit 
Data center transformation takes a step by step approach through integrated projects carried out over time  This differs from a traditional method of data center upgrades that takes a serial and siloed approach              The typical projects within a data center transformation initiative include standardization consolidation  virtualization  automation and security 

Standardization consolidation  Reducing the number of data centers                         and avoiding server sprawl              both physical and virtual              often includes replacing aging data center equipment              and is aided by standardization             
Virtualization  Lowers capital and operational expenses              reduces energy consumption              Virtualized desktops can be hosted in data centers and rented out on a subscription basis               Investment bank Lazard Capital Markets estimated in      that    percent of enterprise operations will be virtualized by       Gartner views virtualization as a catalyst for modernization             
Automating  Automating tasks such as provisioning  configuration  patching  release management  and compliance is needed  not just when facing fewer skilled IT workers             
Securing  Protection of virtual systems is integrated with the existing security of physical infrastructures             
Raised floor edit 
Perforated cooling floor tile
Main article  Raised floor
A raised floor standards guide named GR      was developed by Telcordia Technologies  a subsidiary of Ericsson             
Although the first raised floor computer room was made by IBM in                   and they ve  been around since the     s               it was the     s that made it more common for computer centers to thereby allow cool air to circulate more efficiently                         
The first purpose of the raised floor was to allow access for wiring             

Lights out edit 
The lights out             data center  also known as a darkened or a dark data center  is a data center that  ideally  has all but eliminated the need for direct access by personnel  except under extraordinary circumstances  Because of the lack of need for staff to enter the data center  it can be operated without lighting  All of the devices are accessed and managed by remote systems  with automation programs used to perform unattended operations  In addition to the energy savings  reduction in staffing costs and the ability to locate the site further from population centers  implementing a lights out data center reduces the threat of malicious attacks upon the infrastructure                         

Noise levels edit 
Generally speaking  local authorities prefer noise levels at data centers to be          dB below the existing night time background noise level at the nearest residence              
OSHA regulations require monitoring of noise levels inside data centers if noise exceeds    decibels              The average noise level in server areas of a data center may reach as high as            dB A              
Residents living near data centers have described the sound as  a high pitched whirring noise        saying   It s like being on a tarmac with an airplane engine running constantly     Except that the airplane keeps idling and never leaves                                                  
External sources of noise include HVAC equipment and energy generators                         

Data center design edit 
The field of data center design has been growing for decades in various directions  including new construction big and small along with the creative re use of existing facilities  like abandoned retail space  old salt mines and war era bunkers 

a    story data center has already been proposed            
the number of data centers as of      had grown beyond   million USA wide  and more than triple that number worldwide           
Local building codes may govern the minimum ceiling heights and other parameters  Some of the considerations in the design of data centers are 

A typical server rack  commonly seen in colocation
Size   one room of a building  one or more floors  or an entire building 
Capacity   can hold up to or past       servers            
Other considerations   Space  power  cooling  and costs in the data center             
Mechanical engineering infrastructure   heating  ventilation and air conditioning  HVAC   humidification and dehumidification equipment  pressurization             
Electrical engineering infrastructure design    utility service planning  distribution  switching and bypass from power sources  uninterruptible power source  UPS  systems  and more                         
CRAC Air Handler
Design criteria and trade offs edit 
Availability expectations  The costs of avoiding downtime should not exceed the cost of the downtime itself            
Site selection  Location factors include proximity to power grids  telecommunications infrastructure  networking services  transportation lines and emergency services  Other considerations should include flight paths  neighboring power drains  geological risks  and climate  associated with cooling costs              
Often  power availability is the hardest to change 
High availability edit 
Main article  High availability
Various metrics exist for measuring the data availability that results from data center availability beyond     uptime  with the top of the scale counting how many nines can be placed after                 

Modularity and flexibility edit 
Main article  Modular data center
Modularity and flexibility are key elements in allowing for a data center to grow and change over time  Data center modules are pre engineered  standardized building blocks that can be easily configured and moved as needed             
A modular data center may consist of data center equipment contained within shipping containers or similar portable containers              Components of the data center can be prefabricated and standardized which facilitates moving if needed             

Environmental control edit 
Temperature and humidity are controlled via 

Air conditioning
indirect cooling  such as using outside air                              note        Indirect Evaporative Cooling  IDEC  units  and also using sea water 
It is important that computers do not get humid or overheat  as high humidity can lead to dust clogging the fans  which leads to overheat  or can cause components to malfunction  ruining the board and running a fire hazard  Overheat can cause components  usually the silicon or copper of the wires or circuits to melt  causing connections to loosen  causing fire hazards  

Electrical power edit

Diesel powered generator of a hospital data center
Backup power consists of one or more uninterruptible power supplies  battery banks  and or diesel   gas turbine generators             
To prevent single points of failure  all elements of the electrical systems  including backup systems  are typically given redundant copies  and critical servers are connected to both the A side and B side power feeds  This arrangement is often made to achieve N   redundancy in the systems  Static transfer switches are sometimes used to ensure instantaneous switchover from one supply to the other in the event of a power failure 

Low voltage cable routing edit 
Options include 

Data cabling can be routed through overhead cable trays            
Raised floor cabling  both for security reasons and to avoid the extra cost of cooling systems over the racks 
Smaller less expensive data centers may use anti static tiles instead for a flooring surface 
Air flow edit 
Air flow management addresses the need to improve data center computer cooling efficiency by preventing the recirculation of hot air exhausted from IT equipment and reducing bypass airflow  There are several methods of separating hot and cold airstreams  such as hot cold aisle containment and in row cooling units             

Aisle containment edit 
Cold aisle containment is done by exposing the rear of equipment racks  while the fronts of the servers are enclosed with doors and covers  This is similar to how large scale food companies refrigerate and store their products Typical cold aisle configuration with server rack fronts facing each other and cold air distributed through the raised floor
Computer cabinets Server farms are often organized for containment of hot cold aisles  Proper air duct placement prevents the cold and hot air from mixing  Rows of cabinets are paired to face each other so that the cool and hot air intakes and exhausts don t mix air  which would severely reduce cooling efficiency 
Alternatively  a range of underfloor panels can create efficient cold air pathways directed to the raised floor vented tiles  Either the cold aisle or the hot aisle can be contained             
Another option is fitting cabinets with vertical exhaust duct chimneys              Hot exhaust pipes vents ducts can direct the air into a Plenum space above a Dropped ceiling and back to the cooling units or to outside vents  With this configuration  traditional hot cold aisle configuration is not a requirement             

Fire protection edit 
FM    fire suppression tanks
Data centers feature fire protection systems  including passive and Active Design elements  as well as implementation of fire prevention programs in operations  Smoke detectors are usually installed to provide early warning of a fire at its incipient stage 
Although the main room usually does not allow Wet Pipe based Systems due to the fragile nature of Circuit boards  there still exist systems that can be used in the rest of the facility or in cold hot aisle air circulation systems that are closed systems  such as             

Sprinkler systems
Misting  using high pressure to create extremely small water droplets  which can be used in sensitive rooms due to the nature of the droplets 
However  there also exist other means to put out fires  especially in Sensitive areas  usually using Gaseous fire suppression  of which Halon gas was the most popular  until the negative effects of producing and using it were discovered    

Security edit 
Main article  Data center security
Physical access is usually restricted  Layered security often starts with fencing  bollards and mantraps              Video camera surveillance and permanent security guards are almost always present if the data center is large or contains sensitive information  Fingerprint recognition mantraps are starting to be commonplace 
Logging access is required by some data protection regulations  some organizations tightly link this to access control systems  Multiple log entries can occur at the main entrance  entrances to internal rooms  and at equipment cabinets  Access control at cabinets can be integrated with intelligent power distribution units  so that locks are networked through the same appliance             

Energy use edit 
Google Data Center  The Dalles  Oregon
Main article  IT energy management
Energy use is a central issue for data centers  Power draw ranges from a few kW for a rack of servers in a closet to several tens of MW for large facilities  Some facilities have power densities more than     times that of a typical office building              For higher power density facilities  electricity costs are a dominant operating expense and account for over     of the total cost of ownership  TCO  of a data center             

Greenhouse gas emissions edit 
In       data centers  excluding cryptocurrency mining  and data transmission each used about    of world electricity              Although some of this electricity was low carbon  the IEA called for more  government and industry efforts on energy efficiency  renewables procurement and RD amp D               as some data centers still use electricity generated by fossil fuels              They also said that lifecycle emissions should be considered  that is including embodied emissions  such as in buildings              Data centers are estimated to have been responsible for      of US greenhouse gas emissions in                   Some Chinese companies  such as Tencent  have pledged to be carbon neutral by       while others such as Alibaba have been criticized by Greenpeace for not committing to become carbon neutral              Google and Microsoft now each consume more power than some fairly big countries  surpassing the consumption of more than     countries             

Energy efficiency and overhead edit 
The most commonly used energy efficiency metric for data centers is power usage effectiveness  PUE   calculated as the ratio of total power entering the data center divided by the power used by IT equipment

PUE measures the percentage of power used by overhead devices  cooling  lighting  etc    The average USA data center has a PUE of                  meaning two watts of total power  overhead   IT equipment  for every watt delivered to IT equipment  State of the art data centers are estimated to have a PUE of roughly                  Google publishes quarterly efficiency metrics from its data centers in operation              PUEs of as low as      have been achieved with two phase immersion cooling             
The U S  Environmental Protection Agency has an Energy Star rating for standalone or large data centers  To qualify for the ecolabel  a data center must be within the top quartile in energy efficiency of all reported facilities              The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of       United States  requires federal facilities including data centers to operate more efficiently  California s Title           of the California Code of Regulations mandates that every newly constructed data center must have some form of airflow containment in place to optimize energy efficiency 
The European Union also has a similar initiative  EU Code of Conduct for Data Centres             

Energy use analysis and projects edit 
The focus of measuring and analyzing energy use goes beyond what is used by IT equipment  facility support hardware such as chillers and fans also use energy             
In       server racks in data centers were designed for more than         kW and the typical server was estimated to waste about     of the electricity it consumed  The energy demand for information storage systems is also rising  A high availability data center is estimated to have a   megawatt  MW  demand and consume             in electricity over its lifetime  with cooling representing     to     of the data center s total cost of ownership  Calculations show that in two years  the cost of powering and cooling a server could be equal to the cost of purchasing the server hardware              Research in      has shown that a substantial amount of energy could still be conserved by optimizing IT refresh rates and increasing server utilization             
In       Facebook  Rackspace and others founded the Open Compute Project  OCP  to develop and publish open standards for greener data center computing technologies  As part of the project  Facebook published the designs of its server  which it had built for its first dedicated data center in Prineville  Making servers taller left space for more effective heat sinks and enabled the use of fans that moved more air with less energy  By not buying commercial off the shelf servers  energy consumption due to unnecessary expansion slots on the motherboard and unneeded components  such as a graphics card  was also saved              In       Google joined the project and published the designs of its   V DC shallow data center rack  This design had long been part of Google data centers  By eliminating the multiple transformers usually deployed in data centers  Google had achieved a     increase in energy efficiency              In       sales for data center hardware built to OCP designs topped      billion and are expected to reach    billion by                  

Power and cooling analysis edit 
Data center at CERN       
Power is the largest recurring cost to the user of a data center               Cooling at or below          F           C  wastes money and energy              Furthermore  overcooling equipment in environments with a high relative humidity can expose equipment to a high amount of moisture that facilitates the growth of salt deposits on conductive filaments in the circuitry             
A power and cooling analysis  also referred to as a thermal assessment  measures the relative temperatures in specific areas as well as the capacity of the cooling systems to handle specific ambient temperatures              A power and cooling analysis can help to identify hot spots  over cooled areas that can handle greater power use density  the breakpoint of equipment loading  the effectiveness of a raised floor strategy  and optimal equipment positioning  such as AC units  to balance temperatures across the data center  Power cooling density is a measure of how much square footage the center can cool at maximum capacity              The cooling of data centers is the second largest power consumer after servers  The cooling energy varies from     of the total energy consumption in the most efficient data centers and goes up to     in standard air cooled data centers 

Energy efficiency analysis edit 
An energy efficiency analysis measures the energy use of data center IT and facilities equipment  A typical energy efficiency analysis measures factors such as a data center s Power Use Effectiveness  PUE  against industry standards  identifies mechanical and electrical sources of inefficiency  and identifies air management metrics              However  the limitation of most current metrics and approaches is that they do not include IT in the analysis  Case studies have shown that by addressing energy efficiency holistically in a data center  major efficiencies can be achieved that are not possible otherwise              

Computational Fluid Dynamics  CFD  analysis edit 
Main article  Computational fluid dynamics
This type of analysis uses sophisticated tools and techniques to understand the unique thermal conditions present in each data center predicting the temperature  airflow  and pressure behavior of a data center to assess performance and energy consumption  using numerical modeling               By predicting the effects of these environmental conditions  CFD analysis of a data center can be used to predict the impact of high density racks mixed with low density racks              and the onward impact on cooling resources  poor infrastructure management practices  and AC failure or AC shutdown for scheduled maintenance 

Thermal zone mapping edit 
Thermal zone mapping uses sensors and computer modeling to create a three dimensional image of the hot and cool zones in a data center              
This information can help to identify optimal positioning of data center equipment  For example  critical servers might be placed in a cool zone that is serviced by redundant AC units 

Green data centers edit 
Main article  Green data center
 This water cooled data center in the Port of Strasbourg  France claims the attribute green 
Data centers use a lot of power  consumed by two main usages  The power required to run the actual equipment and then the power required to cool the equipment  Power efficiency reduces the first category 
Cooling cost reduction through natural means includes location decisions  When the focus is avoiding good fiber connectivity  power grid connections  and people concentrations to manage the equipment  a data center can be miles away from the users  Mass data centers like Google or Facebook don t need to be near population centers  Arctic locations that can use outside air  which provides cooling  are becoming more popular              
Renewable electricity sources are another plus  Thus countries with favorable conditions  such as Canada               Finland               Sweden               Norway               and Switzerland              are trying to attract cloud computing data centers 
Singapore lifted a three year ban on new data centers in April       A major data center hub for the Asia Pacific region               Singapore lifted its moratorium on new data center projects in       granting   new projects  but rejecting more than    data center applications from over    new data centers applications received  Singapore s new data centers shall meet very strict green technology criteria including  Water Usage Effectiveness  WUE  of     MWh  Power Usage Effectiveness  PUE  of less than      and have a  Platinum certification under Singapore s BCA IMDA Green Mark for New Data Centre  criteria that clearly addressed decarbonization and use of hydrogen cells or solar panels                                                     

Direct current data centers edit 
See also  Power distribution unit  Inspur Server Series  Switched mode power supply  and Off the grid
Direct current data centers are data centers that produce direct current on site with solar panels and store the electricity on site in a battery storage power station   Computers run on direct current and the need for inverting the AC power from the grid would be eliminated  The data center site could still use AC power as a grid as a backup solution   DC data centers could be     more efficient and use less floor space for inverting components                           

Energy reuse edit 
It is very difficult to reuse the heat which comes from air cooled data centers  For this reason  data center infrastructures are more often equipped with heat pumps              
An alternative to heat pumps is the adoption of liquid cooling throughout a data center  Different liquid cooling techniques are mixed and matched to allow for a fully liquid cooled infrastructure that captures all heat with water  Different liquid technologies are categorized in   main groups  indirect liquid cooling  water cooled racks   direct liquid cooling  direct to chip cooling  and total liquid cooling  complete immersion in liquid  see server immersion cooling   This combination of technologies allows the creation of a thermal cascade as part of temperature chaining scenarios to create high temperature water outputs from the data center      citation needed

Cryptomining and the artificial intelligence boom of the     s has also led to increased demand for electricity                            that the IEA expects could double global overall data center demand for electricity between      and                  The US could see its share of the electricity market going to data centers increase from    to    over those four years             Bitcoin used up    of US electricity in                    This has led to increased electricity prices in some regions               particularly in regions with lots of data centers like Santa Clara  California              and upstate New York               Data centers have also generated concerns in Northern Virginia about whether residents will have to foot the bill for future power lines               It has also made it harder to develop housing in London               A Bank of America Institute report in July      found that the increase in demand for electricity due in part to AI has been pushing electricity prices higher and is a significant contributor to electricity inflation                                        

Dynamic infrastructure edit 
Main article  Dynamic infrastructure
Dynamic infrastructure              provides the ability to intelligently  automatically and securely move workloads within a data center              anytime  anywhere  for migrations  provisioning               to enhance performance  or building co location facilities  It also facilitates performing routine maintenance on either physical or virtual systems all while minimizing interruption  A related concept is Composable Infrastructure  which allows for the dynamic reconfiguration of the available resources to suit needs  only when needed              
Side benefits include

reducing cost
facilitating business continuity and high availability
enabling cloud and grid computing              
Network infrastructure edit 
An operation engineer overseeing a network operations control room of a data center       
An example of network infrastructure of a data center
Communications in data centers today are most often based on networks running the Internet protocol suite  Data centers contain a set of routers and switches that transport traffic between the servers and to the outside world              which are connected according to the data center network architecture  Redundancy of the internet connection is often provided by using two or more upstream service providers  see Multihoming  
Some of the servers at the data center are used for running the basic internet and intranet services needed by internal users in the organization  e g   e mail servers  proxy servers  and DNS servers 
Network security elements are also usually deployed  firewalls  VPN gateways  intrusion detection systems  and so on  Also common are monitoring systems for the network and some of the applications  Additional off site monitoring systems are also typical  in case of a failure of communications inside the data center 

Software data backup edit 
Non mutually exclusive options for data backup are 

Onsite
Offsite
Onsite is traditional               and one of its major advantages is immediate availability 

Offsite backup storage edit 
Main article  Off site data protection
Data backup techniques include having an encrypted copy of the data offsite  Methods used for transporting data are              

Having the customer write the data to a physical medium  such as magnetic tape  and then transporting the tape elsewhere              
Directly transferring the data to another site during the backup  using appropriate links 
Uploading the data  into the cloud               
Modular data center edit 
Main article  Modular data center
A    foot Portable Modular Data Center
For quick deployment or IT disaster recovery  several large hardware vendors have developed mobile modular solutions that can be installed and made operational in a very short amount of time 

Micro data center edit 
Micro data centers  MDCs  are access level data centers which are smaller in size than traditional data centers but provide the same features               They are typically located near the data source to reduce communication delays  as their small size allows several MDCs to be spread out over a wide area                            MDCs are well suited to user facing  front end applications               They are commonly used in edge computing and other areas where low latency data processing is needed              

Data centers in space edit 
Space data center  D design
Data centers in space is a proposed idea to place a data center in outer space with a sun synchronous orbit around planet earth   The theoretical advantages are the sun synchronous orbit can catch solar power with the solar panels at all times  space is cold for data center cooling  weather forecasting and weather prediction computation from weather satellites               and the ability to freely scale up

Notes edit 


  Old large computer rooms that housed machines like the U S  Army s ENIAC  which were developed pre              are now referred to as data centers 

  Until the early     s  it was primarily the government that used computers  which were large mainframes housed in rooms that today we call data centers 

  In the     s  network connected minicomputers  servers  running without input or display devices were housed in the old computer rooms  These new  data centers  or  server rooms  were built within company walls  co located with low cost networking equipment 

  There was considerable construction of data centers during the early     s  in the period of expanding dot com businesses 

  In May       data center research organization Uptime Institute reported that    percent of the large companies it surveyed expect to exhaust IT capacity within the next    months  James Niccolai   Data Centers Turn to Outsourcing to Meet Capacity Needs   CIO magazine  Archived from the original on             Retrieved
