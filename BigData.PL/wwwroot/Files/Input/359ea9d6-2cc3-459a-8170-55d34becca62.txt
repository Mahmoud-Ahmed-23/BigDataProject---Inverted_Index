In reference to economics  rational agent refers to hypothetical consumers and how they make decisions in a free market  This concept is one of the assumptions made in neoclassical economic theory  The concept of economic rationality arises from a tradition of marginal analysis used in neoclassical economics  The idea of a rational agent is important to the philosophy of utilitarianism  as detailed by philosopher Jeremy Bentham s theory of the felicific calculus  also known as the hedonistic calculus 
The action a rational agent takes depends on 

the preferences of the agent
the agent s information of its environment  which may come from past experiences
the actions  duties and obligations available to the agent
the estimated or actual benefits and the chances of success of the actions 
In game theory and classical economics  it is often assumed that the actors  people  and firms are rational   However  the extent to which people and firms behave rationally is subject to debate   Economists often assume the models of rational choice theory and bounded rationality to formalize and predict the behavior of individuals and firms   Rational agents sometimes behave in manners that are counter intuitive to many people  as in the traveler s dilemma 

Alternate theories edit 
Neuroeconomics is a concept that uses neuroscience  social psychology and other fields of science to better understand how people make decisions   Unlike rational agent theory  neuroeconomics does not attempt to predict large scale human behavior but rather how individuals make decisions in case by case scenarios 

Artificial intelligence edit 
Artificial intelligence has borrowed the term  rational agents  from economics to describe autonomous programs that are capable of goal directed behavior  Today there is a considerable overlap between AI research  game theory and decision theory  Rational agents in AI are closely related to intelligent agents  autonomous software programs that display intelligence
