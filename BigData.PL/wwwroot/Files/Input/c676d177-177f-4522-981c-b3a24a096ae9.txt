The human brain is the central organ of the nervous system  and with the spinal cord  comprises the central nervous system  It consists of the cerebrum  the brainstem and the cerebellum  The brain controls most of the activities of the body  processing  integrating  and coordinating the information it receives from the sensory nervous system  The brain integrates sensory information and coordinates instructions sent to the rest of the body 
The cerebrum  the largest part of the human brain  consists of two cerebral hemispheres  Each hemisphere has an inner core composed of white matter  and an outer surface   the cerebral cortex   composed of grey matter  The cortex has an outer layer  the neocortex  and an inner allocortex  The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers  while the allocortex has three or four  Each hemisphere is divided into four lobes   the frontal  parietal  temporal  and occipital lobes  The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self control  planning  reasoning  and abstract thought  while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision  Within each lobe  cortical areas are associated with specific functions  such as the sensory  motor  and association regions  Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function  some functions are associated with one side  such as language in the left and visual spatial ability in the right  The hemispheres are connected by commissural nerve tracts  the largest being the corpus callosum 
The cerebrum is connected by the brainstem to the spinal cord  The brainstem consists of the midbrain  the pons  and the medulla oblongata  The cerebellum is connected to the brainstem by three pairs of nerve tracts called cerebellar peduncles  Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system  consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated  Underneath the cerebral cortex are several  structures  including the thalamus  the epithalamus  the pineal gland  the hypothalamus  the pituitary gland  and the subthalamus  the limbic structures  including the amygdalae and the hippocampi  the claustrum  the various nuclei of the basal ganglia  the basal forebrain structures  and three circumventricular organs  Brain structures that are not on the midplane exist in pairs  for example  there are two hippocampi and two amygdalae  
The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells  There are more than    billion neurons in the brain  and a more or less equal number of other cells  Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses  Neurons connect to form neural pathways  neural circuits  and elaborate network systems  The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission 
The brain is protected by the skull  suspended in cerebrospinal fluid  and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood brain barrier  However  the brain is still susceptible to damage  disease  and infection  Damage can be caused by trauma  or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke  The brain is susceptible to degenerative disorders  such as Parkinson s disease  dementias including Alzheimer s disease  and multiple sclerosis  Psychiatric conditions  including schizophrenia and clinical depression  are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions  The brain can also be the site of tumours  both benign and malignant  these mostly originate from other sites in the body 
The study of the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy  while the study of its function is neuroscience  Numerous techniques are used to study the brain  Specimens from other animals  which may be examined microscopically  have traditionally provided much information  Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging  and electroencephalography  EEG  recordings are important in studying the brain  The medical history of people with brain injury has provided insight into the function of each part of the brain  Neuroscience research has expanded considerably  and research is ongoing 
In culture  the philosophy of mind has for centuries attempted to address the question of the nature of consciousness and the mind body problem  The pseudoscience of phrenology attempted to localise personality attributes to regions of the cortex in the   th century  In science fiction  brain transplants are imagined in tales such as the      Donovan s Brain

The adult human brain weighs on average about              kg               lb  which is about    of the total body weight                        with a volume of around           cm  in men and           cm  in women             There is substantial individual variation             with the standard reference range for men being                  g                 lb             and for women                  g                 lb             
The cerebrum  consisting of the cerebral hemispheres  forms the largest part of the brain and overlies the other brain structures             The outer region of the hemispheres  the cerebral cortex  is grey matter  consisting of cortical layers of neurons  Each hemisphere is divided into four main lobes   the frontal lobe  parietal lobe  temporal lobe  and occipital lobe             Three other lobes are included by some sources which are a central lobe  a limbic lobe  and an insular lobe             The central lobe comprises the precentral gyrus and the postcentral gyrus and is included since it forms a distinct functional role                        
The brainstem  resembling a stalk  attaches to and leaves the cerebrum at the start of the midbrain area  The brainstem includes the midbrain  the pons  and the medulla oblongata  Behind the brainstem is the cerebellum  Latin  little brain             
The cerebrum  brainstem  cerebellum  and spinal cord are covered by three membranes called meninges  The membranes are the tough dura mater  the middle arachnoid mater and the more delicate inner pia mater  Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space and subarachnoid cisterns  which contain the cerebrospinal fluid              The outermost membrane of the cerebral cortex is the basement membrane of the pia mater called the glia limitans and is an important part of the blood brain barrier              In      a fourth meningeal membrane has been proposed known as the subarachnoid lymphatic like membrane                          The living brain is very soft  having a gel like consistency similar to soft tofu              The cortical layers of neurons constitute much of the cerebral grey matter  while the deeper subcortical regions of myelinated axons  make up the white matter             The white matter of the brain makes up about half of the total brain volume

Major gyri and sulci on the lateral surface of the cortex
Lobes of the brain
The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is divided into nearly symmetrical left and right hemispheres by a deep groove  the longitudinal fissure              Asymmetry between the lobes is noted as a petalia              The hemispheres are connected by five commissures that span the longitudinal fissure  the largest of these is the corpus callosum            
Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four main lobes  the frontal lobe  parietal lobe  temporal lobe  and occipital lobe  named according to the skull bones that overlie them             Each lobe is associated with one or two specialised functions though there is some functional overlap between them              The surface of the brain is folded into ridges  gyri  and grooves  sulci   many of which are named  usually according to their position  such as the frontal gyrus of the frontal lobe or the central sulcus separating the central regions of the hemispheres  There are many small variations in the secondary and tertiary folds             
The outer part of the cerebrum is the cerebral cortex  made up of grey matter arranged in layers  It is   to   millimetres        to            in  thick  and deeply folded to give a convoluted appearance              Beneath the cortex is the cerebral white matter  The largest part of the cerebral cortex is the neocortex  which has six neuronal layers  The rest of the cortex is of allocortex  which has three or four layers            
The cortex is mapped by divisions into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann s areas  These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope              The cortex is divided into two main functional areas   a motor cortex and a sensory cortex              The primary motor cortex  which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord  occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe  directly in front of the somatosensory area  The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus  Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe  the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex  and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe  The remaining parts of the cortex are called the association areas  These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception  thought  and decision making              The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention  abstract thinking  behaviour  problem solving tasks  and physical reactions and personality                          The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe  its main functions are visual reception  visual spatial processing  movement  and colour recognition                          There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus  The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories  language  and some hearing and speech             

Cortical folds and white matter in horizontal bisection of head
The cerebrum contains the ventricles where the cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated  Below the corpus callosum is the septum pellucidum  a membrane that separates the lateral ventricles  Beneath the lateral ventricles is the thalamus and to the front and below is the hypothalamus  The hypothalamus leads on to the pituitary gland  At the back of the thalamus is the brainstem             
The basal ganglia  also called basal nuclei  are a set of structures deep within the hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation              The largest component is the striatum  others are the globus pallidus  the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus              The striatum is divided into a ventral striatum  and dorsal striatum  subdivisions that are based upon function and connections  The ventral striatum consists of the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle whereas the dorsal striatum consists of the caudate nucleus and the putamen  The putamen and the globus pallidus lie separated from the lateral ventricles and thalamus by the internal capsule  whereas the caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts the lateral ventricles on their outer sides              At the deepest part of the lateral sulcus between the insular cortex and the striatum is a thin neuronal sheet called the claustrum             
Below and in front of the striatum are a number of basal forebrain structures  These include the nucleus basalis  diagonal band of Broca  substantia innominata  and the medial septal nucleus  These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter  acetylcholine  which is then distributed widely throughout the brain  The basal forebrain  in particular the nucleus basalis  is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex             

Cerebellum edit 
Human brain viewed from below  showing cerebellum and brainstem
Main article  Cerebellum
The cerebellum is divided into an anterior lobe  a posterior lobe  and the flocculonodular lobe              The anterior and posterior lobes are connected in the middle by the vermis              Compared to the cerebral cortex  the cerebellum has a much thinner outer cortex that is narrowly furrowed into numerous curved transverse fissures             
Viewed from underneath between the two lobes is the third lobe the flocculonodular lobe              The cerebellum rests at the back of the cranial cavity  lying beneath the occipital lobes  and is separated from these by the cerebellar tentorium  a sheet of fibre             
It is connected to the brainstem by three pairs of nerve tracts called cerebellar peduncles  The superior pair connects to the midbrain  the middle pair connects to the medulla  and the inferior pair connects to the pons              The cerebellum consists of an inner medulla of white matter and an outer cortex of richly folded grey matter              The cerebellum s anterior and posterior lobes appear to play a role in the coordination and smoothing of complex motor movements  and the flocculonodular lobe in the maintenance of balance             although debate exists as to its cognitive  behavioural and motor functions             

Brainstem edit 
Main article  Brainstem
The brainstem lies beneath the cerebrum and consists of the midbrain  pons and medulla  It lies in the back part of the skull  resting on the part of the base known as the clivus  and ends at the foramen magnum  a large opening in the occipital bone  The brainstem continues below this as the spinal cord              protected by the vertebral column 
Ten of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves     a      emerge directly from the brainstem              The brainstem also contains many cranial nerve nuclei and nuclei of peripheral nerves  as well as nuclei involved in the regulation of many essential processes including breathing  control of eye movements and balance                          The reticular formation  a network of nuclei of ill defined formation  is present within and along the length of the brainstem              Many nerve tracts  which transmit information to and from the cerebral cortex to the rest of the body  pass through the brainstem             

Microanatomy edit 
The human brain is primarily composed of neurons  glial cells  neural stem cells  and blood vessels  Types of neuron include interneurons  pyramidal cells including Betz cells  motor neurons  upper and lower motor neurons   and cerebellar Purkinje cells  Betz cells are the largest cells  by size of cell body  in the nervous system              The adult human brain is estimated to contain      billion neurons  with a roughly equal number        billion  of non neuronal cells              Out of these neurons     billion       are located in the cerebral cortex  and    billion       are in the cerebellum                        
Types of glial cell are astrocytes  including Bergmann glia   oligodendrocytes  ependymal cells  including tanycytes   radial glial cells  microglia  and a subtype of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells  Astrocytes are the largest of the glial cells  They are stellate cells with many processes radiating from their cell bodies  Some of these processes end as perivascular endfeet on capillary walls              The glia limitans of the cortex is made up of astrocyte endfeet processes that serve in part to contain the cells of the brain             
Mast cells are white blood cells that interact in the neuroimmune system in the brain              Mast cells in the central nervous system are present in a number of structures including the meninges              they mediate neuroimmune responses in inflammatory conditions and help to maintain the blood brain barrier  particularly in brain regions where the barrier is absent                          Mast cells serve the same general functions in the body and central nervous system  such as effecting or regulating allergic responses  innate and adaptive immunity  autoimmunity  and inflammation              Mast cells serve as the main effector cell through which pathogens can affect the biochemical signaling that takes place between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system                         
Some     genes are shown to be brain specific  In all neurons  ELAVL  is expressed  and in pyramidal cells  NRGN and REEP  are also expressed  GAD    essential for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA   is expressed in interneurons  Proteins expressed in glial cells include astrocyte markers GFAP and S   B whereas myelin basic protein and the transcription factor OLIG  are expressed in oligodendrocytes             

Cerebrospinal fluid edit 
Cerebrospinal fluid circulates in spaces around and within the brain
Main article  Cerebrospinal fluid
Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear  colourless transcellular fluid that circulates around the brain in the subarachnoid space  in the ventricular system  and in the central canal of the spinal cord  It also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space  known as subarachnoid cisterns              The four ventricles  two lateral  a third  and a fourth ventricle  all contain a choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid              The third ventricle lies in the midline and is connected to the lateral ventricles              A single duct  the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum  connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle              Three separate openings  the middle and two lateral apertures  drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna  one of the major cisterns  From here  cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space  between the arachnoid mater and pia mater             
At any one time  there is about    mL of cerebrospinal fluid   most within the subarachnoid space  It is constantly being regenerated and absorbed  and is replaced about once every     hours             
A glymphatic system has been described as the lymphatic drainage system of the brain                          The brain wide glymphatic pathway includes drainage routes from the cerebrospinal fluid  and from the meningeal lymphatic vessels that are associated with the dural sinuses  and run alongside the cerebral blood vessels                          The pathway drains interstitial fluid from the tissue of the brain             

Blood supply edit 
Main article  Cerebral circulation
Two circulations joining at the circle of Willis  inferior view 
Diagram showing features of cerebral outer membranes and supply of blood vessels
The internal carotid arteries supply oxygenated blood to the front of the brain and the vertebral arteries supply blood to the back of the brain              These two circulations join in the circle of Willis  a ring of connected arteries that lies in the interpeduncular cistern between the midbrain and pons             
The internal carotid arteries are branches of the common carotid arteries  They enter the cranium through the carotid canal  travel through the cavernous sinus and enter the subarachnoid space              They then enter the circle of Willis  with two branches  the anterior cerebral arteries emerging  These branches travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure  and supply the front and midline parts of the brain              One or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior cerebral arteries shortly after they emerge as branches              The internal carotid arteries continue forward as the middle cerebral arteries  They travel sideways along the sphenoid bone of the eye socket  then upwards through the insula cortex  where final branches arise  The middle cerebral arteries send branches along their length             
The vertebral arteries emerge as branches of the left and right subclavian arteries  They travel upward through transverse foramina which are spaces in the cervical vertebrae  Each side enters the cranial cavity through the foramen magnum along the corresponding side of the medulla              They give off one of the three cerebellar branches  The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery  which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons  and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches              Finally  the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries  These travel outwards  around the superior cerebellar peduncles  and along the top of the cerebellar tentorium  where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes              Each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries 

Blood drainage edit 
Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated blood from the brain  The brain has two main networks of veins  an exterior or superficial network  on the surface of the cerebrum that has three branches  and an interior network  These two networks communicate via anastomosing  joining  veins              The veins of the brain drain into larger cavities of the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull              Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein  Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage  either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins             
The blood in the deep part of the brain drains  through a venous plexus into the cavernous sinus at the front  and the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses at the sides  and the inferior sagittal sinus at the back              Blood drains from the outer brain into the large superior sagittal sinus  which rests in the midline on top of the brain  Blood from here joins with blood from the straight sinus at the confluence of sinuses             
Blood from here drains into the left and right transverse sinuses              These then drain into the sigmoid sinuses  which receive blood from the cavernous sinus and superior and inferior petrosal sinuses  The sigmoid drains into the large internal jugular veins                         

The blood brain barrier edit 
The larger arteries throughout the brain supply blood to smaller capillaries  These smallest of blood vessels in the brain  are lined with cells joined by tight junctions and so fluids do not seep in or leak out to the same degree as they do in other capillaries  this creates the blood brain barrier              Pericytes play a major role in the formation of the tight junctions              The barrier is less permeable to larger molecules  but is still permeable to water  carbon dioxide  oxygen  and most fat soluble substances  including anaesthetics and alcohol               The blood brain barrier is not present in the circumventricular organs which are structures in the brain that may need to respond to changes in body fluids such as the pineal gland  area postrema  and some areas of the hypothalamus              There is a similar blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier  which serves the same purpose as the blood brain barrier  but facilitates the transport of different substances into the brain due to the distinct structural characteristics between the two barrier systems                         

Development edit 
Main article  Development of the nervous system in humans
Further information  Development of the human brain
Neurulation and neural crest cells
Primary and secondary vesicle stages of development in the early embryo to the fifth week
Brain of a human embryo in the sixth week of development
At the beginning of the third week of development  the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate              By the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end  a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end  These swellings are known as the primary brain vesicles and represent the beginnings of the forebrain  prosencephalon   midbrain  mesencephalon   and hindbrain  rhombencephalon                          
Neural crest cells  derived from the ectoderm  populate the lateral edges of the plate at the neural folds  In the fourth week during the neurulation stage the neural folds close to form the neural tube  bringing together the neural crest cells at the neural crest              The neural crest runs the length of the tube with cranial neural crest cells at the cephalic end and caudal neural crest cells at the tail  Cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal  head to tail  wave inside the tube              Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain  and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord             
The tube flexes as it grows  forming the crescent shaped cerebral hemispheres at the head  The cerebral hemispheres first appear on day                
Early in the fourth week  the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure              This flexed part becomes the forebrain  prosencephalon   the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain  mesencephalon  and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain  rhombencephalon   These areas are formed as swellings known as the three primary brain vesicles  In the fifth week of development five secondary brain vesicles have formed              The forebrain separates into two vesicles   an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon  The telencephalon gives rise to the cerebral cortex  basal ganglia  and related structures  The diencephalon gives rise to the thalamus and hypothalamus  The hindbrain also splits into two areas   the metencephalon and the myelencephalon  The metencephalon gives rise to the cerebellum and pons  The myelencephalon gives rise to the medulla oblongata              Also during the fifth week  the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres                          In the hindbrain these are known as rhombomeres             
A characteristic of the brain is the cortical folding known as gyrification  For just over five months of prenatal development the cortex is smooth  By the gestational age of    weeks  the wrinkled morphology showing the fissures that begin to mark out the lobes of the brain is evident              Why the cortex wrinkles and folds is not well understood  but gyrification has been linked to intelligence and neurological disorders  and a number of gyrification theories have been proposed              These theories include those based on mechanical buckling                          axonal tension              and differential tangential expansion              What is clear is that gyrification is not a random process  but rather a complex developmentally predetermined process which generates patterns of folds that are consistent between individuals and most species                         
The first groove to appear in the fourth month is the lateral cerebral fossa              The expanding caudal end of the hemisphere has to curve over in a forward direction to fit into the restricted space  This covers the fossa and turns it into a much deeper ridge known as the lateral sulcus and this marks out the temporal lobe              By the sixth month other sulci have formed that demarcate the frontal  parietal  and occipital lobes              A gene present in the human genome  ARHGAP  B  may play a major role in gyrification and encephalisation

Function edit 
Motor and sensory regions of the brain
Motor control edit 
The frontal lobe is involved in reasoning  motor control  emotion  and language  It contains the motor cortex  which is involved in planning and coordinating movement  the prefrontal cortex  which is responsible for higher level cognitive functioning  and Broca s area  which is essential for language production              The motor system of the brain is responsible for the generation and control of movement              Generated movements pass from the brain through nerves to motor neurons in the body  which control the action of muscles  The corticospinal tract carries movements from the brain  through the spinal cord  to the torso and limbs              The cranial nerves carry movements related to the eyes  mouth and face 
Gross movement   such as locomotion and the movement of arms and legs   is generated in the motor cortex  divided into three parts  the primary motor cortex  found in the precentral gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts  These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas  lying anterior to the primary motor cortex  the premotor area and the supplementary motor area              The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts  allowing finer movement  this has been visualised in a motor homunculus              Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over  decussate  at the medullary pyramids  These then travel down the spinal cord  with most connecting to interneurons  in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves              The cerebellum and basal ganglia  play a role in fine  complex and coordinated muscle movements              Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone  posture and movement initiation  and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system             

Sensory edit 
Cortical areas
Routing of neural signals from the two eyes to the brain
The sensory nervous system is involved with the reception and processing of sensory information  This information is received through the cranial nerves  through tracts in the spinal cord  and directly at centres of the brain exposed to the blood              The brain also receives and interprets information from the special senses of vision  smell  hearing  and taste  Mixed motor and sensory signals are also integrated             
From the skin  the brain receives information about fine touch  pressure  pain  vibration and temperature  From the joints  the brain receives information about joint position              The sensory cortex is found just near the motor cortex  and  like the motor cortex  has areas related to sensation from different body parts  Sensation collected by a sensory receptor on the skin is changed to a nerve signal  that is passed up a series of neurons through tracts in the spinal cord  The dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway contains information about fine touch  vibration and position of joints  The pathway fibres travel up the back part of the spinal cord to the back part of the medulla  where they connect with second order neurons that immediately send fibres across the midline  These fibres then travel upwards into the ventrobasal complex in the thalamus where they connect with third order neurons which send fibres up to the sensory cortex              The spinothalamic tract carries information about pain  temperature  and gross touch  The pathway fibres travel up the spinal cord and connect with second order neurons in the reticular formation of the brainstem for pain and temperature  and also terminate at the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus for gross touch             
Vision is generated by light that hits the retina of the eye  Photoreceptors in the retina transduce the sensory stimulus of light into an electrical nerve signal that is sent to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe  The arrangements of the eyes  optics cause light from the left visual field to be received by the rightmost portion of each retina  and vice versa  This arrangement ultimately means that a portion of each retina is processed by each hemisphere of the cortex  such that both the right and left visual cortex process information from both eyes  Visual signals leave the retinas through the optic nerves  Optic nerve fibres from the retinas  nasal halves cross to the opposite sides joining the fibres from the temporal halves of the opposite retinas  which do not cross  forming the optic tracts  The optic tract fibres reach the brain at the lateral geniculate nucleus  and travel through the optic radiation to reach the visual cortex             
Hearing and balance are both generated in the inner ear  Sound results in vibrations of the ossicles which continue finally to the hearing organ  and change in balance results in movement of liquids within the inner ear  This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve  From here  it passes through to the cochlear nuclei  the superior olivary nucleus  the medial geniculate nucleus  and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex             
The sense of smell is generated by receptor cells in the epithelium of the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity  This information passes via the olfactory nerve which goes into the skull through a relatively permeable part  This nerve transmits to the neural circuitry of the olfactory bulb from where information is passed to the olfactory cortex                         
Taste is generated from receptors on the tongue and passed along the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves into the solitary nucleus in the brainstem  Some taste information is also passed from the pharynx into this area via the vagus nerve  Information is then passed from here through the thalamus into the gustatory cortex             

Regulation edit 
Autonomic functions of the brain include the regulation  or rhythmic control of the heart rate and rate of breathing  and maintaining homeostasis 
Blood pressure and heart rate are influenced by the vasomotor centre of the medulla  which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest  It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve              Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch  and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve  Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve  This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla  Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly             
The brain controls the rate of breathing  mainly by respiratory centres in the medulla and pons              The respiratory centres control respiration  by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord  along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration  This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres  There are four respiratory centres  three with a more clearly defined function  and an apneustic centre with a less clear function  In the medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body  Also in the medulla  the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion  In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath              and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation  The respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH  Information about blood oxygen  carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed on the walls of arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies  This information is passed via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the respiratory centres  High carbon dioxide  an acidic pH  or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centres              The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which  when activated  prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the respiratory centres via the vagus nerve             
The hypothalamus in the diencephalon  is involved in regulating many functions of the body  Functions include neuroendocrine regulation  regulation of the circadian rhythm  control of the autonomic nervous system  and the regulation of fluid  and food intake  The circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus  The anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles  generates a roughly    hour circadian clock  In the circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern  Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body s systems  There are also findings that suggest that the daily build up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep              Whilst awake the brain consumes a fifth of the body s total energy needs  Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy giving ATP  The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep             
The lateral hypothalamus contains orexinergic neurons that control appetite and arousal through their projections to the ascending reticular activating system                          The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland through the release of peptides such as oxytocin  and vasopressin  as well as dopamine into the median eminence  Through the autonomic projections  the hypothalamus is involved in regulating functions such as blood pressure  heart rate  breathing  sweating  and other homeostatic mechanisms               The hypothalamus also plays a role in thermal regulation  and when stimulated by the immune system  is capable of generating a fever  The hypothalamus is influenced by the kidneys  when blood pressure falls  the renin released by the kidneys stimulates a need to drink  The hypothalamus also regulates food intake through autonomic signals  and hormone release by the digestive system              

Language edit 
Broca s area and Wernicke s area are linked by the arcuate fasciculus 
Main article  Language processing in the brain
See also  Two streams hypothesis        Two auditory systems
While language functions were traditionally thought to be localised to Wernicke s area and Broca s area               it is now mostly accepted that a wider network of cortical regions contributes to language functions                                        
The study on how language is represented  processed  and acquired by the brain is called neurolinguistics  which is a large multidisciplinary field drawing from cognitive neuroscience  cognitive linguistics  and psycholinguistics              

Lateralisation edit

See also  Contralateral brain
The cerebrum has a contralateral organisation with each hemisphere of the brain interacting primarily with one half of the body  the left side of the brain interacts with the right side of the body  and vice versa  This is theorized to be caused by a developmental axial twist               Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord  and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain  both cross sides in the brainstem  Visual input follows a more complex rule  the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm  and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other               The result is that connections from the left half of the retina  in both eyes  go to the left side of the brain  whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain               Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field  the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain  and vice versa               Thus  the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body  and visual input from the left side of the visual field                           
The left and right sides of the brain appear symmetrical  but they function asymmetrically               For example  the counterpart of the left hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right hemisphere area controlling the left hand  There are  however  several important exceptions  involving language and spatial cognition  The left frontal lobe is dominant for language  If a key language area in the left hemisphere is damaged  it can leave the victim unable to speak or understand               whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills 
A substantial part of current understanding of the interactions between the two hemispheres has come from the study of  split brain patients  people who underwent surgical transection of the corpus callosum in an attempt to reduce the severity of epileptic seizures               These patients do not show unusual behaviour that is immediately obvious  but in some cases can behave almost like two different people in the same body  with the right hand taking an action and then the left hand undoing it                            These patients  when briefly shown a picture on the right side of the point of visual fixation  are able to describe it verbally  but when the picture is shown on the left  are unable to describe it  but may be able to give an indication with the left hand of the nature of the object shown                           

Emotion edit

Further information  Affective neuroscience
Emotions are generally defined as two step multicomponent processes involving elicitation  followed by psychological feelings  appraisal  expression  autonomic responses  and action tendencies               Attempts to localise basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial  some research found no evidence for specific locations corresponding to emotions  but instead found circuitry involved in general emotional processes  The amygdala  orbitofrontal cortex  mid and anterior insular cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex  appeared to be involved in generating the emotions  while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area  ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience               Others  however  have found evidence of activation of specific regions  such as the basal ganglia in happiness  the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness  and amygdala in fear              

Cognition edit 
Main article  Cognition Further information  Prefrontal cortex        Executive function
The brain is responsible for cognition                            which functions through numerous processes and executive functions                                         Executive functions include the ability to filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition  the ability to process and manipulate information held in working memory  the ability to think about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility  the ability to inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control  and the ability to determine the relevance of information or appropriateness of an action                            Higher order executive functions require the simultaneous use of multiple basic executive functions  and include planning  prospection and fluid intelligence  i e   reasoning and problem solving               
The prefrontal cortex plays a significant role in mediating executive functions                                         Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  DLPFC   anterior cingulate cortex  angular prefrontal cortex  right prefrontal cortex  and supramarginal gyrus               Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC  inferior frontal gyrus  and areas of the parietal cortex                            Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex  as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus                                        

Physiology edit 
Neurotransmission edit 
Main article  Neurotransmission
Further information  Summation  neurophysiology 
Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets               A neuron consists of a cell body  axon  and dendrites  Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons  The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential  an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse  which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal  to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron  An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon  which contains a specialised complex of proteins               When an action potential reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell               These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine  serotonin  GABA  glutamate  and acetylcholine               GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain  and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter               Neurons link at synapses to form neural pathways  neural circuits  and large elaborate network systems such as the salience network and the default mode network  and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission 

Metabolism edit 
PET image of the human brain showing energy consumption
The brain consumes up to     of the energy used by the human body  more than any other organ               In humans  blood glucose is the primary source of energy for most cells and is critical for normal function in a number of tissues  including the brain               The human brain consumes approximately     of blood glucose in fasted  sedentary individuals               Brain metabolism normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source  but during times of low glucose  such as fasting  endurance exercise  or limited carbohydrate intake   the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose  The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise               The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen  albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle               Long chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood brain barrier  but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies  However  short chain fatty acids  e g   butyric acid  propionic acid  and acetic acid  and the medium chain fatty acids  octanoic acid and heptanoic acid  can cross the blood brain barrier and be metabolised by brain cells                                        
Although the human brain represents only    of the body weight  it receives     of the cardiac output      of total body oxygen consumption  and     of total body glucose utilization               The brain mostly uses glucose for energy  and deprivation of glucose  as can happen in hypoglycemia  can result in loss of consciousness               The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time  but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions  which forms the basis for the functional neuroimaging methods of PET and fMRI               These techniques provide a three dimensional image of metabolic activity               A preliminary study showed that brain metabolic requirements in humans peak at about five years old              
The function of sleep is not fully understood  however  there is evidence that sleep enhances the clearance of metabolic waste products  some of which are potentially neurotoxic  from the brain and may also permit repair                                        Evidence suggests that the increased clearance of metabolic waste during sleep occurs via increased functioning of the glymphatic system              Sleep may also have an effect on cognitive function by weakening unnecessary connections              

Research edit 
The brain is not fully understood  and research is ongoing               Neuroscientists  along with researchers from allied disciplines  study how the human brain works  The boundaries between the specialties of neuroscience  neurology and other disciplines such as psychiatry have faded as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience 
Neuroscience research has expanded considerably  The  Decade of the Brain   an initiative of the United States Government in the     s  is considered to have marked much of this increase in research               and was followed in      by the BRAIN Initiative               The Human Connectome Project was a five year study launched in      to analyse the anatomical and functional connections of parts of the brain  and has provided much data              
An emerging phase in research may be that of simulating brain activity              

Methods edit 
Information about the structure and function of the human brain comes from a variety of experimental methods  including animals and humans  Information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the brain and the effects of brain damage  Neuroimaging is used to visualise the brain and record brain activity  Electrophysiology is used to measure  record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex  Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas  or of the activity of a single neuron  An electroencephalogram can record the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non invasively on the scalp                           
Invasive measures include electrocorticography  which uses electrodes placed directly on the exposed surface of the brain  This method is used in cortical stimulation mapping  used in the study of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function               By using much smaller microelectrodes  single unit recordings can be made from a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution  This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour  and the creation of neuronal maps              
The development of cerebral organoids has opened ways for studying the growth of the brain  and of the cortex  and for understanding disease development  offering further implications for therapeutic applications                           

Imaging edit 
Further information  Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain
FMRI of healthy human brain
Functional neuroimaging techniques show changes in brain activity that relate to the function of specific brain areas  One technique is functional magnetic resonance imaging  fMRI  which has the advantages over earlier methods of SPECT and PET of not needing the use of radioactive materials and of offering a higher resolution               Another technique is functional near infrared spectroscopy  These methods rely on the haemodynamic response that shows changes in brain activity in relation to changes in blood flow  useful in mapping functions to brain areas               Resting state fMRI
looks at the interaction of brain regions whilst the brain is not performing a specific task               This is also used to show the default mode network 
Any electrical current generates a magnetic field  neural oscillations induce weak magnetic fields  and in functional magnetoencephalography the current produced can show localised brain function in high resolution               Tractography uses MRI and image analysis to create  D images of the nerve tracts of the brain  Connectograms give a graphical representation of the neural connections of the brain              
Differences in brain structure can be measured in some disorders  notably schizophrenia and dementia  Different biological approaches using imaging have given more insight for example into the disorders of depression and obsessive compulsive disorder  A key source of information about the function of brain regions is the effects of damage to them              
Advances in neuroimaging have enabled objective insights into mental disorders  leading to faster diagnosis  more accurate prognosis  and better monitoring              

Gene and protein expression edit 
Main article  Bioinformatics
See also  List of neuroscience databases
Bioinformatics is a field of study that includes the creation and advancement of databases  and computational and statistical techniques  that can be used in studies of the human brain  particularly in the areas of gene and protein expression  Bioinformatics and studies in genomics  and functional genomics  generated the need for DNA annotation  a transcriptome technology  identifying genes  their locations and functions                                         GeneCards is a major database 
As of          update       just under        protein coding genes are seen to be expressed in the human               and some     of these genes are brain specific                            The data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research into a number of disorders  The long term use of alcohol for example  has shown altered gene expression in the brain  and cell type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder               These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex  and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence  and also to other substance abuses              
Other related studies have also shown evidence of synaptic alterations and their loss  in the ageing brain  Changes in gene expression alter the levels of proteins in various neural pathways and this has been shown to be evident in synaptic contact dysfunction or loss  This dysfunction has been seen to affect many structures of the brain and has a marked effect on inhibitory neurons resulting in a decreased level of neurotransmission  and subsequent cognitive decline and disease                           

Clinical significance edit 
Injury edit 
Injury to the brain can manifest in many ways  Traumatic brain injury  for example received in contact sport  after a fall  or a traffic or work accident  can be associated with both immediate and longer term problems  Immediate problems may include bleeding within the brain  this may compress the brain tissue or damage its blood supply  Bruising to the brain may occur  Bruising may cause widespread damage to the nerve tracts that can lead to a condition of diffuse axonal injury               A fractured skull  injury to a particular area  deafness  and concussion are also possible immediate developments  In addition to the site of injury  the opposite side of the brain may be affected  termed a contrecoup injury  Longer term issues that may develop include posttraumatic stress disorder  and hydrocephalus  Chronic traumatic encephalopathy can develop following multiple head injuries              

Disease edit 
Neurodegenerative diseases result in progressive damage to  or loss of neurons affecting  different functions of the brain  that worsen with age  Common types are dementias including Alzheimer s disease  alcoholic dementia  vascular dementia  and  Parkinson s disease dementia  Other rarer infectious  genetic  or metabolic types include Huntington s disease  motor neuron diseases  HIV dementia  syphilis related dementia and Wilson s disease  Neurodegenerative diseases can affect different parts of the brain  and can affect movement  memory  and cognition               Rare prion diseases including Creutzfeldt Jakob disease and its variant  and kuru are fatal neurodegenerative diseases              
Cerebral atherosclerosis is atherosclerosis that affects the brain  It results from the build up of plaques formed of cholesterol  in the large arteries of the brain  and can be mild to significant  When significant  arteries can become narrowed enough to reduce blood flow  It contributes to the development of dementia  and has protein similarities to those found in Alzheimer s disease              
The brain  although protected by the blood brain barrier  can be affected by infections including viruses  bacteria and fungi  Infection may be of the meninges  meningitis   the brain matter  encephalitis   or within the brain matter  such as a cerebral abscess               

Tumours edit 
Brain tumours can be either benign or cancerous  Most malignant tumours arise from another part of the body  most commonly from the lung  breast and skin               Cancers of brain tissue can also occur  and originate from any tissue in and around the brain  Meningioma  cancer of the meninges around the brain  is more common than cancers of brain tissue               Cancers within the brain may cause symptoms related to their size or position  with symptoms including headache and nausea  or the gradual development of focal symptoms such as gradual difficulty seeing  swallowing  talking  or as a change of mood               Cancers are in general investigated through the use of CT scans and MRI scans  A variety of other tests including blood tests and lumbar puncture may be used to investigate for the cause of the cancer and evaluate the type and stage of the cancer               The corticosteroid dexamethasone is often given to decrease the swelling of brain tissue around a tumour  Surgery may be considered  however given the complex nature of many tumours or based on tumour stage or type  radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be considered more suitable              

Mental disorders edit 
Mental disorders  such as depression  schizophrenia  bipolar disorder  posttraumatic stress disorder  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  obsessive compulsive disorder  Tourette syndrome  and addiction  are known to relate to the functioning of the brain                                         Treatment for mental disorders may include psychotherapy  psychiatry  social intervention and personal recovery work or cognitive behavioural therapy  the underlying issues and associated prognoses vary significantly between individuals              

Epilepsy edit 
Epileptic seizures are thought to relate to abnormal electrical activity               Seizure activity can manifest as absence of consciousness  focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech  or be generalized in nature               Status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within five minutes               Seizures have a large number of causes  however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found  In a person with epilepsy  risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness  drug and alcohol intake  and stress  Seizures may be assessed using blood tests  EEG and various medical imaging techniques based on the medical history and medical examination findings               In addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors  anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further seizures              

Congenital edit 
Some brain disorders  such as Tay Sachs disease               are congenital and linked to genetic and chromosomal mutations               A rare group of congenital cephalic disorders known as lissencephaly is characterised by the lack of  or inadequacy of  cortical folding               Normal development of the brain can be affected during pregnancy by nutritional deficiencies               teratogens               infectious diseases               and by the use of recreational drugs  including alcohol  which may result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders                            
Most cerebral arteriovenous malformations are congenital  these tangled networks of blood vessels may remain without symptoms but at their worst may rupture and cause intracranial hemorrhaging              

Stroke edit 
Main article  Stroke
CT scan of a cerebral hemorrhage  showing an intraparenchymal bleed  bottom arrow  with surrounding edema  top arrow 
A stroke is a decrease in blood supply to an area of the brain causing cell death and brain injury  This can lead to a wide range of symptoms  including the  FAST  symptoms of facial droop  arm weakness  and speech difficulties  including with speaking and finding words or forming sentences                Symptoms relate to the function of the affected area of the brain and can point to the likely site and cause of the stroke  Difficulties with movement  speech  or sight usually relate to the cerebrum  whereas imbalance  double vision  vertigo and symptoms affecting more than one side of the body usually relate to the brainstem or cerebellum              
Most strokes result from loss of blood supply  typically because of an embolus  rupture of a fatty plaque causing thrombus  or narrowing of small arteries  Strokes can also result from bleeding within the brain               Transient ischaemic attacks  TIAs  are strokes in which symptoms resolve within    hours               Investigation into the stroke will involve a medical examination  including a neurological examination  and the taking of a medical history  focusing on the duration of the symptoms and risk factors  including high blood pressure  atrial fibrillation  and smoking                Further investigation is needed in younger patients               An ECG and biotelemetry may be conducted to identify atrial fibrillation  an ultrasound can investigate narrowing of the carotid arteries  an echocardiogram can be used to look for clots within the heart  diseases of the heart valves or the presence of a patent foramen ovale               Blood tests are routinely done as part of the workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile              
Some treatments for stroke are time critical  These include clot dissolution or surgical removal of a clot for ischaemic strokes  and decompression for haemorrhagic strokes                            As stroke is time critical               hospitals and even pre hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations   usually a CT scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and a CT or MR angiogram to evaluate arteries that supply the brain               MRI scans  not as widely available  may be able to demonstrate the affected area of the brain more accurately  particularly with ischaemic stroke              
Having experienced a stroke  a person may be admitted to a stroke unit  and treatments may be directed as preventing future strokes  including ongoing anticoagulation  such as aspirin or clopidogrel   antihypertensives  and lipid lowering drugs               A multidisciplinary team including speech pathologists  physiotherapists  occupational therapists  and psychologists plays a large role in supporting a person affected by a stroke and their rehabilitation                            A history of stroke increases the risk of developing dementia by around      and recent stroke increases the risk by around

Brain death refers to an irreversible total loss of brain function                            This is characterised by coma  loss of reflexes  and apnoea               however  the declaration of brain death varies geographically and is not always accepted               In some countries there is also a defined syndrome of brainstem death               Declaration of brain death can have profound implications as the declaration  under the principle of medical futility  will be associated with the withdrawal of life support               and as those with brain death often have organs suitable for organ donation                            The process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients  families              
When brain death is suspected  reversible differential diagnoses such as  electrolyte  neurological and drug related cognitive suppression need to be excluded                            Testing for reflexes     b      can be of help in the decision  as can the absence of response and breathing               Clinical observations  including a total lack of responsiveness  a known diagnosis  and neural imaging evidence  may all play a role in the decision to pronounce brain death              

Society and culture edit 
Neuroanthropology is the study of the relationship between culture and the brain  It explores how the brain gives rise to culture  and how culture influences brain development               Cultural differences and their relation to brain development and structure are researched in different fields              

The mind edit 
Main articles  Cognition and Mind
The skull of Phineas Gage  with the path of the iron rod that passed through it without killing him  but altering his cognition  The case helped to convince people that mental functions were localised in the brain              
The philosophy of the mind studies such issues as the problem of understanding consciousness and the mind body problem  The relationship between the brain and the mind is a significant challenge both philosophically and scientifically  This is because of the difficulty in explaining how mental activities  such as thoughts and emotions  can be implemented by physical structures such as neurons and synapses  or by any other type of physical mechanism  This difficulty was expressed by Gottfried Leibniz in the analogy known as Leibniz s Mill 

One is obliged to admit that perception and what depends upon it is inexplicable on mechanical principles  that is  by figures and motions  In imagining that there is a machine whose construction would enable it to think  to sense  and to have perception  one could conceive it enlarged while retaining the same proportions  so that one could enter into it  just like into a windmill  Supposing this  one should  when visiting within it  find only parts pushing one another  and never anything by which to explain a perception 
  Leibniz  Monadology             
Doubt about the possibility of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove Ren  Descartes  and most other philosophers along with him  to dualism  the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain               There has always  however  been a strong argument in the opposite direction  There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of  or injuries to  the brain  for example by drugs or by lesions  respectively  can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways                            In the   th century  the case of Phineas Gage  a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain  convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain               Following this line of thinking  a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists  believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of  or reducible to  physical phenomena              

Brain size edit 
Main article  Brain size
The size of the brain and a person s intelligence are not strongly related               Studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations  averaging around     to      between brain volume and IQ               The most consistent associations are observed within the frontal  temporal  and parietal lobes  the hippocampi  and the cerebellum  but these only account for a relatively small amount of variance in IQ  which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and real world performance                           
Other animals  including whales and elephants  have larger brains than humans  However  when the brain to body mass ratio is taken into account  the human brain is almost twice as large as that of a bottlenose dolphin  and three times as large as that of a chimpanzee  However  a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence  very small animals have high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal              

In popular culture edit 
Phrenology summarised in an      chart
Earlier ideas about the relative importance of the different organs of the human body sometimes emphasised the heart              
Modern Western popular conceptions  in contrast  have placed increasing focus on the brain              
Research has disproved some common misconceptions about the brain  These include both ancient and modern myths  It is not true  for example  that neurons are not replaced after the age of two  nor that normal humans use only ten per cent of the brain               Popular culture has also oversimplified the lateralisation of the brain by suggesting that functions are completely specific to one side of the brain or the other  Akio Mori coined the term  game brain  for the unreliably supported theory that spending long periods playing video games harmed the brain s pre frontal region  and impaired the expression of emotion and creativity              
Historically  particularly in the early   th century  the brain featured in popular culture through phrenology  a pseudoscience that assigned personality attributes to different regions of the cortex  The cortex remains important in popular culture as covered in books and satire                           
The human brain can feature in science fiction  with themes such as brain transplants and cyborgs  beings with features like partly artificial brains                The      science fiction book  adapted three times for the cinema  Donovan s Brain tells the tale of an isolated brain kept alive in vitro  gradually taking over the personality of the book s protagonist

Early history edit 
Hieroglyph for the word  brain   c             BC 
The Edwin Smith Papyrus  an ancient Egyptian medical treatise written in the   th century BC  contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain  The hieroglyph for brain  occurring eight times in this papyrus  describes the symptoms  diagnosis  and prognosis of two traumatic injuries to the head  The papyrus mentions the external surface of the brain  the effects of injury  including seizures and aphasia   the meninges  and cerebrospinal fluid                           
In the fifth century BC  Alcmaeon of Croton in Magna Grecia  first considered the brain to be the seat of the mind               Also in the fifth century BC in Athens  the unknown author of On the Sacred Disease  a medical treatise which is part of the Hippocratic Corpus and traditionally attributed to Hippocrates  believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence  Aristotle  in his biology initially believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence  and saw the brain as a cooling mechanism for the blood  He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because  among other reasons  they have a larger brain to cool their hot bloodedness               Aristotle did describe the meninges and distinguished between the cerebrum and cerebellum              
Herophilus of Chalcedon in the fourth and third centuries BC distinguished the cerebrum and the cerebellum  and provided the first clear description of the ventricles  and with Erasistratus of Ceos experimented on living brains  Their works are now mostly lost  and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources  Some of their discoveries had to be re discovered a millennium after their deaths               Anatomist physician Galen in the second century AD  during the time of the Roman Empire  dissected the brains of sheep  monkeys  dogs  and pigs  He concluded that  as the cerebellum was denser than the brain  it must control the muscles  while as the cerebrum was soft  it must be where the senses were processed  Galen further theorised that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles                           
In       scientists reported the discovery of a preserved human brain from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in    AD  A man in Herculaneum was caught in a pyroclastic flow  and the extremely high temperature caused the vitrification of his brain  turning it into glass and resulting in  a perfect state of preservation of the brain and its microstructures                It appears to have been the only known case of a vitrified human brain                           

Renaissance edit 
Drawing of the base of the brain  from Andreas Vesalius s      work De humani corporis fabrica
One of Leonardo da Vinci s sketches of the human skull
In       Mondino de Luzzi s Anathomia began the modern study of brain anatomy              
Niccol  Massa discovered in      that the ventricles were filled with fluid               Archangelo Piccolomini of Rome was the first to distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex               In      Andreas Vesalius published his seven volume De humani corporis fabrica                                         The seventh book covered the brain and eye  with detailed images of the ventricles  cranial nerves  pituitary gland  meninges  structures of the eye  the vascular supply to the brain and spinal cord  and an image of the peripheral nerves               Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function  arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans  but no true intelligence              
Ren  Descartes proposed the theory of dualism to tackle the issue of the brain s relation to the mind  He suggested that the pineal gland was where the mind interacted with the body  serving as the seat of the soul and as the connection through which animal spirits passed from the blood into the brain               This dualism likely provided impetus for later anatomists to further explore the relationship between the anatomical and functional aspects of brain anatomy              
Thomas Willis is considered a second pioneer in the study of neurology and brain science  He wrote Cerebri Anatome  Latin  Anatomy of the brain      c      in       followed by Cerebral Pathology in       In these he described the structure of the cerebellum  the ventricles  the cerebral hemispheres  the brainstem  and the cranial nerves  studied its blood supply  and proposed functions associated with different areas of the brain               The circle of Willis was named after his investigations into the blood supply of the brain  and he was the first to use the word  neurology                Willis removed the brain from the body when examining it  and rejected the commonly held view that the cortex only consisted of blood vessels  and the view of the last two millennia that the cortex was only incidentally important              
In the middle of   th century Emil du Bois Reymond and Hermann von Helmholtz were able to use a galvanometer to show that electrical impulses passed at measurable speeds along nerves  refuting the view of their teacher Johannes Peter M ller that the nerve impulse was a vital function that could not be measured                                         Richard Caton in      demonstrated electrical impulses in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys               In the     s  Jean Pierre Flourens pioneered the experimental method of damaging specific parts of animal brains describing the effects on movement and behavior

Drawing of cells in chick cerebellum by Santiago Ram n y Cajal  from  Estructura de los centros nerviosos de las aves   Madrid      
Studies of the brain became more sophisticated with the use of the microscope and the development of a silver staining method by Camillo Golgi during the     s  This was able to show the intricate structures of single neurons               This was used by Santiago Ram n y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine  the then revolutionary hypothesis that the neuron is the functional unit of the brain  He used microscopy to uncover many cell types  and proposed functions for the cells he saw               For this  Golgi and Cajal are considered the founders of twentieth century neuroscience  both sharing the Nobel prize in      for their studies and discoveries in this field              
Charles Sherrington published his influential      work The Integrative Action of the Nervous System examining the function of reflexes  evolutionary development of the nervous system  functional specialisation of the brain  and layout and cellular function of the central nervous system               In      he coined the term enchanted loom as a metaphor for the brain  John Farquhar Fulton  founded the Journal of Neurophysiology and published the first comprehensive textbook on the physiology of the nervous system during                    Neuroscience during the twentieth century began to be recognised as a distinct unified academic discipline  with David Rioch  Francis O  Schmitt  and Stephen Kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field               Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research  starting in the     s               During the same period  Schmitt established the Neuroscience Research Program  an inter university and international organisation  bringing together biology  medicine  psychological and behavioural sciences  The word neuroscience itself arises from this program              
Paul Broca associated regions of the brain with specific functions  in particular language in Broca s area  following work on brain damaged patients               John Hughlings Jackson described the function of the motor cortex by watching the progression of epileptic seizures through the body  Carl Wernicke described a region associated with language comprehension and production  Korbinian Brodmann divided regions of the brain based on the appearance of cells               By       Sherrington  Papez  and MacLean had identified many of the brainstem and limbic system functions                            The capacity of the brain to re organise and change with age  and a recognised critical development period  were attributed to neuroplasticity  pioneered by Margaret Kennard  who experimented on monkeys during the        s              
Harvey Cushing             is recognised as the first proficient brain surgeon in the world               In       Walter Dandy began the practice of vascular neurosurgery by performing the first surgical clipping of an intracranial aneurysm              

Comparative anatomy edit

The human brain has many properties that are common to all vertebrate brains               Many of its features are common to all mammalian brains               most notably a six layered cerebral cortex and a set of associated structures               including the hippocampus and amygdala               The cortex is proportionally larger in humans than in many other mammals               Humans have more association cortex  sensory and motor parts than smaller mammals such as the rat and the cat              
As a primate brain  the human brain has a much larger cerebral cortex  in proportion to body size  than most mammals               and a highly developed visual system                           
As a hominid brain  the human brain is substantially enlarged even in comparison to the brain of a typical monkey  The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus  four million years ago  to Homo sapiens  modern humans  was marked by a steady increase in brain size                            As brain size increased  this altered the size and shape of the skull               from about     cm  in Homo habilis to an average of about           cm  in Homo neanderthalensis               Differences in DNA  gene expression  and gene environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of the human brain and other primates
