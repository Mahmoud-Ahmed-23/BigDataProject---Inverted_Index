Deepfakes  a portmanteau of  deep learning  and  fake              are images  videos  or audio that have been edited or generated using artificial intelligence  AI based tools or AV editing software  They may depict real or fictional people and are considered a form of synthetic media  that is media that is usually created by artificial intelligence systems by combining various media elements into a new media artifact                       
While the act of creating fake content is not new  deepfakes uniquely leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques                                   including facial recognition algorithms and artificial neural networks such as variational autoencoders  VAEs  and generative adversarial networks  GANs                         In turn  the field of image forensics develops techniques to detect manipulated images             Deepfakes have garnered widespread attention for their potential use in creating child sexual abuse material  celebrity pornographic videos  revenge porn  fake news  hoaxes  bullying  and financial fraud                                                
Academics have raised concerns about the potential for deepfakes to promote disinformation and hate speech  as well as interfere with elections  In response  the information technology industry and governments have proposed recommendations and methods to detect and mitigate their use  Academic research has also delved deeper into the factors driving deepfake engagement online as well as potential countermeasures to malicious application of deepfakes 
From traditional entertainment to gaming  deepfake technology has evolved to be increasingly convincing             and available to the public  allowing for the disruption of the entertainment and media industries             


History edit 
Portrait of actress Sydney Sweeney generated by Stable Diffusion
Photo manipulation was developed in the   th century and soon applied to motion pictures  Technology steadily improved during the   th century  and more quickly with the advent of digital video 
Deepfake technology has been developed by researchers at academic institutions beginning in the     s  and later by amateurs in online communities                          More recently the methods have been adopted by industry             

Academic research edit 
Academic research related to deepfakes is split between the field of computer vision  a sub field of computer science              which develops techniques for creating and identifying deepfakes  and humanities and social science approaches that study the social  ethical  aesthetic as well journalist and informational implications of deepfakes              As deepfakes have risen in prominence in popularity with innovations provided by AI tools  significant research has gone into detection methods and defining the factors driving engagement with deepfakes on the internet                          Deepfakes have been shown to appear on social media platforms and other parts of the internet for purposes ranging from entertainment and education related to deepfakes to misinformation to elicit strong reactions              There are gaps in research related to the propagation of deepfakes on social media  Negativity and emotional response are the primary driving factors for users sharing deepfakes             
Age and lack of literacy related to deepfakes are another factor that drives engagement  Older users who may be technologically illiterate might not recognize deepfakes as falsified content and share this content because they believe it to be true  Alternatively  younger users accustomed to the entertainment value of deepfakes are more likely to share them with an awareness of their falsified content              Despite cognitive ability being a factor in successfully detecting deepfakes  individuals who are aware of a deepfake may be just as likely to share it on social media as one who does not know it is a deepfake              Within scholarship focused on detecting deepfakes  deep learning methods using techniques to identify software induced artifacts have been found to be the most effective in separating a deepfake from an authentic product               Due to the capabilities of deepfakes  concerns have developed related to regulations and literacy toward the technology              The potential malicious applications of deepfakes and their capability to impact public figures  reputations  or promote misleading narratives are the primary drivers of these concerns              Amongst some experts  potential malicious applications of deepfakes have encouraged them into labeling deepfakes as a potential danger to democratic societies that would benefit from a regulatory framework to mitigate potential risks             

Social science and humanities approaches to deepfakes edit 
In cinema studies  deepfakes illustrate how how  the human face is emerging as a central object of ambivalence in the digital age               Video artists have used deepfakes to  playfully rewrite film history by retrofitting canonical cinema with new star performers               Film scholar Christopher Holliday analyses how altering the gender and race of performers in familiar movie scenes destabilizes gender classifications and categories              The concept of  queering  deepfakes is also discussed in Oliver M  Gingrich s discussion of media artworks that use deepfakes to reframe gender              including British artist Jake Elwes  Zizi  Queering the Dataset  an artwork that uses deepfakes of drag queens to intentionally play with gender  The aesthetic potentials of deepfakes are also beginning to be explored  Theatre historian John Fletcher notes that early demonstrations of deepfakes are presented as performances  and situates these in the context of theater  discussing  some of the more troubling paradigm shifts  that deepfakes represent as a performance genre             
Philosophers and media scholars have discussed the ethical implications of deepfakes in the dissemination of disinformation  Amina Vatre  from the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Sarajevo identifies three factors contributing to the widespread acceptance of deepfakes  and where its greatest danger lies     convincing visualization and auditory support     widespread accessibility  and    the inability to draw a clear line between truth and falsehood              Another area of discussion on deepfakes is in relation to pornography made with deepfakes              Media scholar Emily van der Nagel draws upon research in photography studies on manipulated images to discuss verification systems  that allow women to consent to uses of their images             
Beyond pornography  deepfakes have been framed by philosophers as an  epistemic threat  to knowledge and thus to society              There are several other suggestions for how to deal with the risks deepfakes give rise beyond pornography  but also to corporations  politicians and others  of  exploitation  intimidation  and personal sabotage               and there are several scholarly discussions of potential legal and regulatory responses both in legal studies and media studies              In psychology and media studies  scholars discuss the effects of disinformation that uses deepfakes                          and the social impact of deepfakes             
While most English language academic studies of deepfakes focus on the Western anxieties about disinformation and pornography  digital anthropologist Gabriele de Seta has analyzed the Chinese reception of deepfakes  which are known as huanlian  which translates to  changing faces   The Chinese term does not contain the  fake  of the English deepfake  and de Seta argues that this cultural context may explain why the Chinese response has centered on practical regulatory measures to  fraud risks  image rights  economic profit  and ethical imbalances              

Computer science research on deepfakes edit 
A landmark early project was the  Video Rewrite  program  published in       The program modified existing video footage of a person speaking to depict that person mouthing the words from a different audio track              It was the first system to fully automate this kind of facial reanimation  and it did so using machine learning techniques to make connections between the sounds produced by a video s subject and the shape of the subject s face             
Contemporary academic projects have focused on creating more realistic videos and improving deepfake techniques                          The  Synthesizing Obama  program  published in       modifies video footage of former president Barack Obama to depict him mouthing the words contained in a separate audio track              The project lists as a main research contribution to its photorealistic technique for synthesizing mouth shapes from audio              The  Face Face  program  published in       modifies video footage of a person s face to depict them mimicking another person s facial expressions              The project highlights its primary research contribution as the development of the first method for re enacting facial expressions in real time using a camera that does not capture depth  enabling the technique to work with common consumer cameras 
In August       researchers at the University of California  Berkeley published a paper introducing a deepfake dancing app that can create the impression of masterful dancing ability using AI              This project expands the application of deepfakes to the entire body  previous works focused on the head or parts of the face             
Researchers have also shown that deepfakes are expanding into other domains such as medical imagery              In this work  it was shown how an attacker can automatically inject or remove lung cancer in a patient s  D CT scan  The result was so convincing that it fooled three radiologists and a state of the art lung cancer detection AI  To demonstrate the threat  the authors successfully performed the attack on a hospital in a White hat penetration test             
A survey of deepfakes  published in May       provides a timeline of how the creation and detection deepfakes have advanced over the last few years              The survey identifies that researchers have been focusing on resolving the following challenges of deepfake creation 

Generalization  High quality deepfakes are often achieved by training on hours of footage of the target  This challenge is to minimize the amount of training data and the time to train the model required to produce quality images and to enable the execution of trained models on new identities  unseen during training  
Paired Training  Training a supervised model can produce high quality results  but requires data pairing  This is the process of finding examples of inputs and their desired outputs for the model to learn from  Data pairing is laborious and impractical when training on multiple identities and facial behaviors  Some solutions include self supervised training  using frames from the same video   the use of unpaired networks such as Cycle GAN  or the manipulation of network embeddings 
Identity leakage  This is where the identity of the driver  i e   the actor controlling the face in a reenactment  is partially transferred to the generated face  Some solutions proposed include attention mechanisms  few shot learning  disentanglement  boundary conversions  and skip connections 
Occlusions  When part of the face is obstructed with a hand  hair  glasses  or any other item then artifacts can occur  A common occlusion is a closed mouth which hides the inside of the mouth and the teeth  Some solutions include image segmentation during training and in painting 
Temporal coherence  In videos containing deepfakes  artifacts such as flickering and jitter can occur because the network has no context of the preceding frames  Some researchers provide this context or use novel temporal coherence losses to help improve realism  As the technology improves  the interference is diminishing 
Overall  deepfakes are expected to have several implications in media and society  media production  media representations  media audiences  gender  law  and regulation  and politics             

Amateur development edit 
The term deepfake originated in late      from a Reddit user named  deepfakes               He  along with other members of Reddit s  r deepfakes   shared deepfakes they created  many videos involved celebrities  faces swapped onto the bodies of actors in pornographic videos              while non pornographic content included many videos with actor Nicolas Cage s face swapped into various movies             
Other online communities remain  including Reddit communities that do not share pornography  such as  r SFWdeepfakes   short for  safe for work deepfakes    in which community members share deepfakes depicting celebrities  politicians  and others in non pornographic scenarios              Other online communities continue to share pornography on platforms that have not banned deepfake pornography             

Commercial development edit 
In January       a proprietary desktop application called  FakeApp  was launched              This app allows users to easily create and share videos with their faces swapped with each other              As of        FakeApp  had been largely replaced by open source alternatives such as  Faceswap   command line based  DeepFaceLab   and web based apps such as DeepfakesWeb com                                    
Larger companies started to use deepfakes              Corporate training videos can be created using deepfaked avatars and their voices  for example Synthesia  which uses deepfake technology with avatars to create personalized videos              The mobile app Momo created the application Zao which allows users to superimpose their face on television and movie clips with a single picture              As of      the Japanese AI company DataGrid made a full body deepfake that could create a person from scratch             
As of      audio deepfakes  and AI software capable of detecting deepfakes and cloning human voices after   seconds of listening time also exist                                                                          A mobile deepfake app  Impressions  was launched in March       It was the first app for the creation of celebrity deepfake videos from mobile phones                         

Resurrection edit 
Deepfake technology s ability to  fabricate messages and actions of others can include deceased individuals  On    October       Kim Kardashian posted a video featuring a hologram of her late father Robert Kardashian created by the company Kaleida  which used a combination of performance  motion tracking  SFX  VFX and DeepFake technologies to create the illusion                         
In       a deepfake video of Joaquin Oliver  a victim of the Parkland shooting was created as part of a gun safety campaign  Oliver s parents partnered with nonprofit Change the Ref and McCann Health to produce a video in which Oliver to encourage people to support gun safety legislation and politicians who back do so as well             
In       a deepfake video of Elvis Presley was used on the program America s Got Talent                
A TV commercial used a deepfake video of Beatles member John Lennon  who was murdered in                  

Techniques edit 
Deepfakes rely on a type of neural network called an autoencoder              These consist of an encoder  which reduces an image to a lower dimensional latent space  and a decoder  which reconstructs the image from the latent representation              Deepfakes utilize this architecture by having a universal encoder which encodes a person in to the latent space      citation needed      The latent representation contains key features about their facial features and body posture  This can then be decoded with a model trained specifically for the target  This means the target s detailed information will be superimposed on the underlying facial and body features of the original video  represented in the latent space      citation needed     
A popular upgrade to this architecture attaches a generative adversarial network to the decoder  A GAN trains a generator  in this case the decoder  and a discriminator in an adversarial relationship  The generator creates new images from the latent representation of the source material  while the discriminator attempts to determine whether or not the image is generated      citation needed      This causes the generator to create images that mimic reality extremely well as any defects would be caught by the discriminator              Both algorithms improve constantly in a zero sum game  This makes deepfakes difficult to combat as they are constantly evolving  any time a defect is determined  it can be corrected             

Applications edit 
Acting edit 
Digital clones of professional actors have appeared in films before  and progress in deepfake technology is expected to further the accessibility and effectiveness of such clones              The use of AI technology was a major issue in the      SAG AFTRA strike  as new techniques enabled the capability of generating and storing a digital likeness to use in place of actors             
Disney has improved their visual effects using high resolution deepfake face swapping technology              Disney improved their technology through progressive training programmed to identify facial expressions  implementing a face swapping feature  and iterating in order to stabilize and refine the output              This high resolution deepfake technology saves significant operational and production costs              Disney s deepfake generation model can produce AI generated media at a      x      resolution  as opposed to common models that produce media at a     x     resolution              The technology allows Disney to de age characters or revive deceased actors              Similar technology was initially used by fans to unofficially insert faces into existing media  such as  overlaying Harrison Ford s young face onto Han Solo s face in Solo  A Star Wars Story              Disney used deepfakes for the characters of Princess Leia and Grand Moff Tarkin in Rogue One                         
The      documentary Welcome to Chechnya used deepfake technology to obscure the identity of the people interviewed  so as to protect them from retaliation             
Creative Artists Agency has developed a facility to capture the likeness of an actor  in a single day   to develop a digital clone of the actor  which would be controlled by the actor or their estate alongside other personality rights             
Companies which have used digital clones of professional actors in advertisements include Puma  Nike and Procter  amp  Gamble             
Deepfakes allowed for the use of David Beckham in a campaign using nearly nine languages to raise awareness the fight against Malaria             
In the      Indian Tamil science fiction action thriller The Greatest of All Time  the teenage version of Vijay s character Jeevan is portrayed by Ayaz Khan  Vijay s teenage face was then attained by AI deepfake             

Art edit 
Deepfakes are also being used in education and media to create realistic videos and interactive content  which offer new ways to engage audiences  However  they also bring risks  especially for spreading false information  which has led to calls for responsible use and clear rules 
In March      the multidisciplinary artist Joseph Ayerle published the video artwork Un emozione per sempre      English title  The Italian Game   The artist worked with Deepfake technology to create an AI actor  a synthetic version of   s movie star Ornella Muti  traveling in time from      to       The Massachusetts Institute of Technology referred this artwork in the study  Collective Wisdom               The artist used Ornella Muti s time travel to explore generational reflections  while also investigating questions about the role of provocation in the world of art              For the technical realization Ayerle used scenes of photo model Kendall Jenner  The program replaced Jenner s face by an AI calculated face of Ornella Muti  As a result  the AI actor has the face of the Italian actor Ornella Muti and the body of Kendall Jenner 
Deepfakes have been widely used in satire or to parody celebrities and politicians  The      webseries Sassy Justice  created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone  heavily features the use of deepfaked public figures to satirize current events and raise awareness of deepfake technology             

Blackmail edit 
Deepfakes can be used to generate blackmail materials that falsely incriminate a victim  A report by the American Congressional Research Service warned that deepfakes could be used to blackmail elected officials or those with access to classified information for espionage or influence purposes             
Alternatively  since the fakes cannot reliably be distinguished from genuine materials  victims of actual blackmail can now claim that the true artifacts are fakes  granting them plausible deniability  The effect is to void credibility of existing blackmail materials  which erases loyalty to blackmailers and destroys the blackmailer s control  This phenomenon can be termed  blackmail inflation   since it  devalues  real blackmail  rendering it worthless              It is possible to utilize commodity GPU hardware with a small software program to generate this blackmail content for any number of subjects in huge quantities  driving up the supply of fake blackmail content limitlessly and in highly scalable fashion             

Entertainment edit 
On June                      Daniel Emmet  a former AGT contestant  teamed up with the AI startup                          Metaphysic AI  to create a hyperrealistic deepfake to make it appear as Simon Cowell  Cowell  notoriously known for severely critiquing contestants               was on stage interpreting  You re The Inspiration  by Chicago  Emmet sang on stage as an image of Simon Cowell emerged on the screen behind him in flawless synchronicity              
On August           Metaphysic AI had  deep fake  Simon Cowell  Howie Mandel and Terry Crews singing opera on stage              
On September           Metaphysic AI performed with a synthetic version of Elvis Presley for the finals of America s Got Talent              
The MIT artificial intelligence project    ai has been used for content creation for multiple Internet fandoms  particularly on social media                                        
In      the bands ABBA and KISS partnered with Industrial Light  amp  Magic and Pophouse Entertainment to develop deepfake avatars capable of performing virtual concerts              

Fraud and scams edit 
Fraudsters and scammers make use of deepfakes to trick people into fake investment schemes  financial fraud  cryptocurrencies  sending money  and following endorsements  The likenesses of celebrities and politicians have been used for large scale scams  as well as those of private individuals  which are used in spearphishing attacks  According to the Better Business Bureau  deepfake scams are becoming more prevalent               These scams are responsible for an estimated     billion in fraud losses globally               According to a recent report these numbers are expected to reach     Billion over the next three years              
Fake endorsements have misused the identities of celebrities like Taylor Swift                            Tom Hanks               Oprah Winfrey               and Elon Musk               news anchors              like Gayle King              and Sally Bundock               and politicians like Lee Hsien Loong              and Jim Chalmers                            Videos of them have appeared in online advertisements on YouTube  Facebook  and TikTok  who have policies against synthetic and manipulated media                                         Ads running these videos are seen by millions of people  A single Medicare fraud campaign had been viewed more than     million times across thousands of videos                            Deepfakes have been used for  a fake giveaway of Le Creuset cookware for a  shipping fee  without receiving the products  except for hidden monthly charges               weight loss gummies that charge significantly more than what was said               a fake iPhone giveaway                            and fraudulent get rich quick                            investment               and cryptocurrency schemes                           
Many ads pair AI voice cloning with  decontextualized video of the celebrity  to mimic authenticity  Others use a whole clip from a celebrity before moving to a different actor or voice               Some scams may involve real time deepfakes              
Celebrities have been warning people of these fake endorsements  and to be more vigilant against them                                         Celebrities are unlikely to file lawsuits against every person operating deepfake scams  as  finding and suing anonymous social media users is resource intensive   though cease and desist letters to social media companies work in getting videos and ads taken down              
Audio deepfakes have been used as part of social engineering scams  fooling people into thinking they are receiving instructions from a trusted individual               In       a U K  based energy firm s CEO was scammed over the phone when he was ordered to transfer          into a Hungarian bank account by an individual who reportedly used audio deepfake technology to impersonate the voice of the firm s parent company s chief executive                           
As of       the combination advances in deepfake technology  which could clone an individual s voice from a recording of a few seconds to a minute  and new text generation tools  enabled automated impersonation scams  targeting victims using a convincing digital clone of a friend or relative              

Identity masking edit 
Audio deepfakes can be used to mask a user s real identity  In online gaming  for example  a player may want to choose a voice that sounds like their in game character when speaking to other players  Those who are subject to harassment  such as women  children  and transgender people  can use these  voice skins  to hide their gender or age              

Memes edit 
In       an internet meme emerged utilizing deepfakes to generate videos of people singing the chorus of  Baka Mitai           a song from the game Yakuza   in the video game series Like a Dragon  In the series  the melancholic song is sung by the player in a karaoke minigame  Most iterations of this meme use a      video uploaded by user Dobbsyrules  who lip syncs the song  as a template                           

Politics edit 
Deepfakes have been used to misrepresent well known politicians in videos 

In February       in separate videos  the face of the Argentine President Mauricio Macri had been replaced by the face of Adolf Hitler  and Angela Merkel s face has been replaced with Donald Trump s                           
In April       Jordan Peele collaborated with Buzzfeed to create a deepfake of Barack Obama with Peele s voice  it served as a public service announcement to increase awareness of deepfakes              
In January       Fox affiliate KCPQ aired a deepfake of Trump during his Oval Office address  mocking his appearance and skin colour  The employee found responsible for the video was subsequently fired              
In June       the United States House Intelligence Committee held hearings on the potential malicious use of deepfakes to sway elections              
In April       the Belgian branch of Extinction Rebellion published a deepfake video of Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilm s on Facebook               The video promoted a possible link between deforestation and COVID     It had more than         views within    hours and received many comments  On the Facebook page where the video appeared  many users interpreted the deepfake video as genuine              
During the      US presidential campaign  many deepfakes surfaced purporting Joe Biden in cognitive decline falling asleep during an interview  getting lost  and misspeaking all bolstering rumors of his decline                           
During the      Delhi Legislative Assembly election campaign  the Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party used similar technology to distribute a version of an English language campaign advertisement by its leader  Manoj Tiwari  translated into Haryanvi to target Haryana voters  A voiceover was provided by an actor  and AI trained using video of Tiwari speeches was used to lip sync the video to the new voiceover  A party staff member described it as a  positive  use of deepfake technology  which allowed them to  convincingly approach the target audience even if the candidate didn t speak the language of the voter               
In       Bruno Sartori produced deepfakes parodying politicians like Jair Bolsonaro and Donald Trump              
In April       politicians in a number of European countries were approached by pranksters Vovan and Lexus  who are accused by critics of working for the Russian state  They impersonated Leonid Volkov  a Russian opposition politician and chief of staff of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny s campaign  allegedly through deepfake technology                                                      However  the pair told The Verge that they did not use deepfakes  and just used a look alike              
In May       a deepfake video of Vice President Kamala Harris supposedly slurring her words and speaking nonsensically about today  tomorrow and yesterday went viral on social media                           
In June       in the United States  Ron DeSantis s presidential campaign used a deepfake to misrepresent Donald Trump              
In March       during India s state assembly elections  deepfake technology was widely employed by political candidates to reach out to voters  Many politicians used AI generated deepfakes created by startup The Indian Deepfaker  founded by Divyendra Singh Jadoun               to translate their speeches into multiple regional languages  allowing them to engage with diverse linguistic communities across the country  This surge in the use of deepfakes for political campaigns marked a significant shift in electioneering tactics in India                           
Pornography edit 
Main article  Deepfake pornography
In       Deepfake pornography prominently surfaced on the Internet  particularly on Reddit               As of       many deepfakes on the internet feature pornography of female celebrities whose likeness is typically used without their consent               A report published in October      by Dutch cybersecurity startup Deeptrace estimated that     of all deepfakes online were pornographic               
As of       a Daisy Ridley deepfake first captured attention               among others                                         As of October       most of the deepfake subjects on the internet were British and American actors               However  around a quarter of the subjects are South Korean  the majority of which are K pop stars                           
In June       a downloadable Windows and Linux application called DeepNude was released that used neural networks  specifically generative adversarial networks  to remove clothing from images of women  The app had both a paid and unpaid version  the paid version costing                                On    June the creators removed the application and refunded consumers              
Female celebrities are often a main target when it comes to deepfake pornography  In       deepfake porn videos appeared online of Emma Watson and Scarlett Johansson in a face swapping app               In       deepfake porn images circulated online of Taylor Swift              
Academic studies have reported that women  LGBT people and people of colour  particularly activists  politicians and those questioning power  are at higher risk of being targets of promulgation of deepfake pornography              

Social media edit 
Deepfakes have begun to see use in popular social media platforms  notably through Zao  a Chinese deepfake app that allows users to substitute their own faces onto those of characters in scenes from films and television shows such as Romeo   Juliet and Game of Thrones               The app originally faced scrutiny over its invasive user data and privacy policy  after which the company put out a statement claiming it would revise the policy              In January      Facebook announced that it was introducing new measures to counter this on its platforms              
The Congressional Research Service cited unspecified evidence as showing that foreign intelligence operatives used deepfakes to create social media accounts with the purposes of recruiting individuals with access to classified information             
In       realistic deepfake videos of actor Tom Cruise were released on TikTok  which went viral and garnered more than tens of millions of views  The deepfake videos featured an  artificial intelligence generated doppelganger  of Cruise doing various activities such as teeing off at the golf course  showing off a coin trick  and biting into a lollipop  The creator of the clips  Belgian VFX Artist Chris Um                said he first got interested in deepfakes in      and saw the  creative potential  of them                           

Sockpuppets edit 
Deepfake photographs can be used to create sockpuppets  non existent people  who are active both online and in traditional media  A deepfake photograph appears to have been generated together with a legend for an apparently non existent person named Oliver Taylor  whose identity was described as a university student in the United Kingdom  The Oliver Taylor persona submitted opinion pieces in several newspapers and was active in online media attacking a British legal academic and his wife  as  terrorist sympathizers   The academic had drawn international attention in      when he commenced a lawsuit in Israel against NSO  a surveillance company  on behalf of people in Mexico who alleged they were victims of NSO s phone hacking technology  Reuters could find only scant records for Oliver Taylor and  his  university had no records for him  Many experts agreed that the profile photo is a deepfake  Several newspapers have not retracted articles attributed to him or removed them from their websites  It is feared that such techniques are a new battleground in disinformation              
Collections of deepfake photographs of non existent people on social networks have also been deployed as part of Israeli partisan propaganda  The Facebook page  Zionist Spring  featured photos of non existent persons along with their  testimonies  purporting to explain why they have abandoned their left leaning politics to embrace right wing politics  and the page also contained large numbers of posts from Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu and his son and from other Israeli right wing sources  The photographs appear to have been generated by  human image synthesis  technology  computer software that takes data from photos of real people to produce a realistic composite image of a non existent person  In much of the  testimonies   the reason given for embracing the political right was the shock of learning of alleged incitement to violence against the prime minister  Right wing Israeli television broadcasters then broadcast the  testimonies  of these non existent people based on the fact that they were being  shared  online  The broadcasters aired these  testimonies  despite being unable to find such people  explaining  Why does the origin matter   Other Facebook fake profiles profiles of fictitious individuals contained material that allegedly contained such incitement against the right wing prime minister  in response to which the prime minister complained that there was a plot to murder him                           

Concerns and countermeasures edit 
Though fake photos have long been plentiful  faking motion pictures has been more difficult  and the presence of deepfakes increases the difficulty of classifying videos as genuine or not               AI researcher Alex Champandard has said people should know how fast things can be corrupted with deepfake technology  and that the problem is not a technical one  but rather one to be solved by trust in information and journalism               Computer science associate professor Hao Li of the University of Southern California states that deepfakes created for malicious use  such as fake news  will be even more harmful if nothing is done to spread awareness of deepfake technology               Li predicted that genuine videos and deepfakes would become indistinguishable in as soon as half a year  as of October       due to rapid advancement in artificial intelligence and computer graphics               Former Google fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder has called deepfakes an area of  societal concern  and said that they will inevitably evolve to a point at which they can be generated automatically  and an individual could use that technology to produce millions of deepfake videos              

Credibility of information edit 
A primary pitfall is that humanity could fall into an age in which it can no longer be determined whether a medium s content corresponds to the truth                            Deepfakes are one of a number of tools for disinformation attack  creating doubt  and undermining trust  They have a potential to interfere with democratic functions in societies  such as identifying collective agendas  debating issues  informing decisions  and solving problems though the exercise of political will               People may also start to dismiss real events as fake              

Defamation edit 
Deepfakes possess the ability to damage individual entities tremendously               This is because deepfakes are often targeted at one individual  and or their relations to others in hopes to create a narrative powerful enough to influence public opinion or beliefs  This can be done through deepfake voice phishing  which manipulates audio to create fake phone calls or conversations               Another method of deepfake use is fabricated private remarks  which manipulate media to convey individuals voicing damaging comments               The quality of a negative video or audio does not need to be that high  As long as someone s likeness and actions are recognizable  a deepfake can hurt their reputation              
In September      Microsoft made public that they are developing a Deepfake detection software tool              
Beyond public figure defamation  deepfakes are increasingly used in K    and higher education settings to target peers with false portrayals that extend well beyond static images or text messages               Students have reported encountering synthetic videos depicting classmates in non consensual intimate acts and experiencing academic or social disruptions as a result  Schools and universities frequently find themselves ill equipped to address these incidents  as most anti bullying policies predate AI generated media and focus narrowly on on campus behavior or student owned devices  When deepfake harassment originates off campus via private social networks  encrypted messaging  or servers hosted overseas administrators struggle to determine jurisdiction  balance free speech concerns  and coordinate with law enforcement  To close these gaps  legal scholars recommend updating both state and federal anti bullying statutes to explicitly include  non consensual synthetic imagery  alongside traditional definitions of harassment  Concurrently  integrating AI literacy curricula covering deepfake detection techniques  ethical considerations  and responsible digital citizenship can empower students to recognize  report  and resist deepfake bullying before it escalates              

Cyberbullying edit 
With the rise of accessible deepfake tools ranging from open source platforms like DeepFaceLab and Faceswap to user friendly mobile apps such as Zao and Impressions malicious actors have begun weaponizing synthetic media as a novel form of cyberbullying               Termed  deepfake bullying   these attacks can take many forms  perpetrators may superimpose a student s face onto videos of underage drinking or drug use  create fabricated nude images without consent  or manufacture scenes of criminal behavior to falsely implicate victims  Because modern generative adversarial networks can produce hyper realistic results  targets often cannot distinguish real from fake  causing intense embarrassment and panic when content first appears  Once released  deepfake content tends to circulate rapidly across messaging apps  social feeds  and even private chat groups  where it can be downloaded  reedited  and recirculated subjecting victims to repeated retraumatization and a persistent fear of new exposures  Psychological assessments of affected students report elevated levels of anxiety  depression  and social withdrawal  some victims have withdrawn from school activities or changed schools entirely to escape ongoing harassment  In response  educators  school counselors  and child psychology experts are calling for explicit policies that define deepfake bullying as a disciplinary offense  mandate immediate content takedowns  and require trauma informed support structures such as specialized counseling services  peer support hotlines  and restorative justice circles to help victims regain a sense of safety and agency              

Detection edit 
Audio edit 
Detecting fake audio is a highly complex task that requires careful attention to the audio signal in order to achieve good performance  Using deep learning  preprocessing of feature design and masking augmentation have been proven effective in improving performance              

Video edit 
Most of the academic research surrounding deepfakes focuses on the detection of deepfake videos               One approach to deepfake detection is to use algorithms to recognize patterns and pick up subtle inconsistencies that arise in deepfake videos               For example  researchers have developed automatic systems that examine videos for errors such as irregular blinking patterns of lighting                           This approach has been criticized because deepfake detection is characterized by a  moving goal post  where the production of deepfakes continues to change and improve as algorithms to detect deepfakes improve               In order to assess the most effective algorithms for detecting deepfakes  a coalition of leading technology companies hosted the Deepfake Detection Challenge to accelerate the technology for identifying manipulated content               The winning model of the Deepfake Detection Challenge was     accurate on the holdout set of       videos               A team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a paper in December      demonstrating that ordinary humans are        accurate at identifying a random sample of    of these videos              
A team at the University of Buffalo published a paper in October      outlining their technique of using reflections of light in the eyes of those depicted to spot deepfakes with a high rate of success  even without the use of an AI detection tool  at least for the time being              
In the case of well documented individuals such as political leaders  algorithms have been developed to distinguish identity based features such as patterns of facial  gestural  and vocal mannerisms and detect deep fake impersonators              
Another team led by Wael AbdAlmageed with Visual Intelligence and Multimedia Analytics Laboratory  VIMAL  of the Information Sciences Institute at the University Of Southern California developed two generations                           of deepfake detectors based on convolutional neural networks  The first generation              used recurrent neural networks to spot spatio temporal inconsistencies to identify visual artifacts left by the deepfake generation process  The algorithm achieved     accuracy on FaceForensics    the only large scale deepfake benchmark available at that time  The second generation              used end to end deep networks to differentiate between artifacts and high level semantic facial information using two branch networks  The first branch propagates colour information while the other branch suppresses facial content and amplifies low level frequencies using Laplacian of Gaussian  LoG   Further  they included a new loss function that learns a compact representation of bona fide faces  while dispersing the representations  i e  features  of deepfakes  VIMAL s approach showed state of the art performance on FaceForensics   and Celeb DF benchmarks  and on March           the same day of the release   was used to identify the deepfake of Volodymyr Zelensky out of the box without any retraining or knowledge of the algorithm with which the deepfake was created       citation needed     
Other techniques suggest that blockchain could be used to verify the source of the media               For instance  a video might have to be verified through the ledger before it is shown on social media platforms               With this technology  only videos from trusted sources would be approved  decreasing the spread of possibly harmful deepfake media              
Digitally signing of all video and imagery by cameras and video cameras  including smartphone cameras  was suggested to fight deepfakes               That allows tracing every photograph or video back to its original owner that can be used to pursue dissidents              
One easy way to uncover deepfake video calls consists in asking the caller to turn sideways              

Prevention edit 
Henry Ajder who works for Deeptrace  a company that detects deepfakes  says there are several ways to protect against deepfakes in the workplace  Semantic passwords or secret questions can be used when holding important conversations  Voice authentication and other biometric security features should be up to date  Educate employees about deepfakes              

Media Literacy and deepfakes edit 
Due to the capability of deepfakes to fool viewers and believably mimic a person  research has indicated that the concept of truth through observation cannot be fully relied on               Additionally  literacy of the technology among populations could be called into question due to the relatively new success of convincing deepfakes               When combined with increasing ease of access to the technology  this has led to the concern amongst some experts that some societies are not prepared to interact with deepfakes organically without potential consequences from sharing misinformation and disinformation               Media literacy has been considered as a potential counter to  prime  a viewer to identify a deepfake when they encounter one organically by engendering critical thinking               While media literacy education can have conflicting results in the overall success in detecting deepfakes               research has indicated that critical thinking and a skeptical outlook toward a presented piece of media are effective at assisting an individual in determining a deepfake                            Media literacy frameworks promote critical analysis of media and the motivations behind the presentation of the associated content  Media literacy shows promise as a potential cognitive countermeasure when interacting with malicious deepfakes              

Controversies edit 
In March       a video clip was shown from the Buckingham Palace  where Kate Middleton had cancer and she was undergoing chemotherapy       
However  the clip fuelled rumours that the woman in that clip was an AI deepfake               UCLA s race director Johnathan Perkins doubted she had cancer  and further speculated that she could be in critical condition or dead              

Politics edit 
Recently  the use of deepfakes has inspired research on deepfake s capability and effects when used in disinformation campaigns  This capability has raised concerns  partly due to the potential of deepfakes to circumvent a person s skepticism and influence their views on an issue                            Due to the continued advancement in technology that improves deceptive capabilities of deepfakes  some scholars believe that deepfakes could pose a significant threat to democratic societies               Studies have investigated the effects of political deepfakes                                         In two separate studies focusing on Dutch participants  it was found that deepfakes have varying effects on an audience  As a tool of disinformation  deepfakes did not necessarily produce stronger reactions or shifts in viewpoints than traditional textual disinformation                However  deepfakes did produce a reassuring effect on individuals who held preconceived notions that aligned with the viewpoint promoted by the deepfake disinformation in the study               Additionally  deepfakes are effective when designed to target a specific demographic segment related to a particular issue                Microtargeting  involves understanding nuanced political issues of a specific demographic to create a targeted deepfake  The targeted deepfake is then used to connect with and influence the viewpoint of that demographic  Targeted deepfakes were found to be notably effective by the researchers               Research has also found that the political effects of deepfakes are not necessarily as straightforward or assured  Researchers in the United Kingdom uncovered that deepfake political disinformation does not have a guaranteed effect on populations beyond indications that it may sow distrust or uncertainty in a source that provides the deepfake               The implications of distrust in sources led researchers to conclude that deepfakes may have outsized effect in a  low trust  information environment where public institutions are not trusted by the public              
Across the world  there are key instances where deepfakes have been used to misrepresent well known politicians and other public figures 

Example events edit 
A fake Midjourney created image of Donald Trump being arrested             
Deepfake video  Vladimir Putin warning Americans on election interference and increasing political divide
The fake Midjourney created image of Pope Francis wearing a puffer jacket
Barack Obama
On April           American actor Jordan Peele  BuzzFeed  and Monkeypaw Productions posted a deepfake of Barack Obama to YouTube  which depicted Barack Obama cursing and calling Donald Trump names               In this deepfake  Peele s voice and face were transformed and manipulated into those of Obama  The intent of this video was to portray the dangerous consequences and power of deepfakes  and how deepfakes can make anyone say anything 
Donald Trump
On May          Derpfakes posted a deepfake of Donald Trump to YouTube  based on a skit Jimmy Fallon performed on The Tonight Show               In the original skit  aired May           Jimmy Fallon dressed as Donald Trump and pretended to participate in a phone call with Barack Obama  conversing in a manner that presented him to be bragging about his primary win in Indiana               In the deepfake  Jimmy Fallon s face was transformed into Donald Trump s face  with the audio remaining the same  This deepfake video was produced by Derpfakes with a comedic intent  In March       a series of images appeared to show New York Police Department officers restraining Trump               The images  created using Midjourney  were initially posted on Twitter by Eliot Higgins but were later re shared without context  leading some viewers to believe they were real photographs              
Nancy Pelosi
In       a clip from Nancy Pelosi s speech at the Center for American Progress  given on May           in which the video was slowed down  in addition to the pitch of the audio being altered  to make it seem as if she were drunk  was widely distributed on social media  Critics argue that this was not a deepfake  but a shallowfake               a less sophisticated form of video manipulation                           
Mark Zuckerberg
In May       two artists collaborating with the company CannyAI created a deepfake video of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg talking about harvesting and controlling data from billions of people  The video was part of an exhibit to educate the public about the dangers of artificial intelligence                           
Kim Jong un and Vladimir Putin
On September           deepfakes of North Korean leader Kim Jong un and Russian President Vladimir Putin were uploaded to YouTube  created by a nonpartisan advocacy group RepresentUs               The deepfakes of Kim and Putin were meant to air publicly as commercials to relay the notion that interference by these leaders in US elections would be detrimental to the United States  democracy  The commercials also aimed to shock Americans to realize how fragile democracy is  and how media and news can significantly influence the country s path regardless of credibility               However  while the commercials included an ending comment detailing that the footage was not real  they ultimately did not air due to fears and sensitivity regarding how Americans may react               On June          an unknown source broadcast a reported deepfake of Vladimir Putin on multiple radio and television networks  In the clip  Putin appears to deliver a speech announcing the invasion of Russia and calling for a general mobilization of the army              
Volodymyr Zelenskyy edit 
On March           a one minute long deepfake video depicting Ukraine s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy seemingly telling his soldiers to lay down their arms and surrender during the      Russian invasion of Ukraine was circulated on social media               Russian social media boosted it  but after it was debunked  Facebook and YouTube removed it  Twitter allowed the video in tweets where it was exposed as a fake  but said it would be taken down if posted to deceive people  Hackers inserted the disinformation into a live scrolling text news crawl on TV station Ukraine     and the video appeared briefly on the station s website in addition to false claims that Zelenskyy had fled his country s capital  Kyiv  It was not immediately clear who created the deepfake  to which Zelenskyy responded with his own video  saying   We don t plan to lay down any arms  Until our victory               
Wolf News
In late       pro China propagandists started spreading deepfake videos purporting to be from  Wolf News  that used synthetic actors  The technology was developed by a London company called Synthesia  which markets it as a cheap alternative to live actors for training and HR videos              
Pope Francis
In March       an anonymous construction worker from Chicago used Midjourney to create a fake image of Pope Francis in a white Balenciaga puffer jacket  The image went viral  receiving over twenty million views               Writer Ryan Broderick dubbed it  the first real mass level AI misinformation case                Experts consulted by Slate characterized the image as unsophisticated   you could have made it on Photoshop five years ago               
Keir Starmer
In October       a deepfake audio clip of the UK Labour Party leader Keir Starmer abusing staffers was released on the first day of a Labour Party conference  The clip purported to be an audio tape of Starmer abusing his staffers              
Rashmika Mandanna
In early November       a famous South Indian actor  Rashmika Mandanna fell prey to DeepFake when a morphed video of a famous British Indian influencer  Zara Patel  with Rashmika s face started to float on social media  Zara Patel claims to not be involved in its creation              
Bongbong Marcos
In April       a deepfake video misrepresenting Philippine President Bongbong Marcos was released  It is a slideshow accompanied by a deepfake audio of Marcos purportedly ordering the Armed Forces of the Philippines and special task force to act  however appropriate  should China attack the Philippines  The video was released amidst tensions related to the South China Sea dispute               The Presidential Communications Office has said that there is no such directive from the president and said a foreign actor might be behind the fabricated media               Criminal charges has been filed by the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas in relation to the deepfake media               On July           a video of Marcos purportedly snorting illegal drugs was released by Claire Contreras  a former supporter of Marcos  Dubbed as the polvoron video  the media noted its consistency with the insinuation of Marcos  predecessor Rodrigo Duterte that Marcos is a drug addict  the video was also shown at a Hakbang ng Maisug rally organized by people aligned with Duterte               Two days later  the Philippine National Police and the National Bureau of Investigation  based on their own findings  concluded that the video was created using AI  they further pointed out inconsistencies with the person on the video with Marcos  such as details on the two people s ears              
Joe Biden
Prior to the      United States presidential election  phone calls imitating the voice of the incumbent Joe Biden were made to dissuade people from voting for him  The person responsible for the calls was charged with voter suppression and impersonating a candidate  The FCC proposed to fine him US        million and Lingo Telecom  the company that allegedly relayed the calls          million                           
Arup Group

Responses edit 
Social media platforms edit 
Twitter  later X  is taking active measures to handle synthetic and manipulated media on their platform  In order to prevent disinformation from spreading  Twitter is placing a notice on tweets that contain manipulated media and or deepfakes that signal to viewers that the media is manipulated               There will also be a warning that appears to users who plan on retweeting  liking  or engaging with the tweet               Twitter will also work to provide users a link next to the tweet containing manipulated or synthetic media that links to a Twitter Moment or credible news article on the related topic as a debunking action               Twitter also has the ability to remove any tweets containing deepfakes or manipulated media that may pose a harm to users  safety               In order to better improve Twitter s detection of deepfakes and manipulated media  Twitter asked users who are interested in partnering with them to work on deepfake detection solutions to fill out a form              
 In August       the secretaries of state of Minnesota  Pennsylvania  Washington  Michigan and New Mexico penned an open letter to X owner Elon Musk urging modifications to its AI chatbot Grok s new text to video generator  added in August       stating that it had disseminated election misinformation                                        
Facebook has taken efforts towards encouraging the creation of deepfakes in order to develop state of the art deepfake detection software  Facebook was the prominent partner in hosting the Deepfake Detection Challenge  DFDC   held December       to      participants who generated more than        models               The top performing models with the highest detection accuracy were analyzed for similarities and differences  these findings are areas of interest in further research to improve and refine deepfake detection models               Facebook has also detailed that the platform will be taking down media generated with artificial intelligence used to alter an individual s speech               However  media that has been edited to alter the order or context of words in one s message would remain on the site but be labeled as false  since it was not generated by artificial intelligence              
On    January       Gfycat began removing all deepfakes from its site                            On Reddit  the r deepfakes subreddit was banned on   February       due to the policy violation of  involuntary pornography                                                                    In the same month  representatives from Twitter stated that they would suspend accounts suspected of posting non consensual deepfake content               Chat site Discord has taken action against deepfakes in the past               and has taken a general stance against deepfakes                            In September       Google added  involuntary synthetic pornographic imagery  to its ban list  allowing anyone to request the block of results showing their fake nudes                   check quotation syntax     
In February       Pornhub said that it would ban deepfake videos on its website because it is considered  non consensual content  which violates their terms of service               They also stated previously to Mashable that they will take down content flagged as deepfakes               Writers from Motherboard reported that searching  deepfakes  on Pornhub still returned multiple recent deepfake videos              
Facebook has previously stated that they would not remove deepfakes from their platforms               The videos will instead be flagged as fake by third parties and then have a lessened priority in user s feeds               This response was prompted in June      after a deepfake featuring a      video of Mark Zuckerberg circulated on Facebook and Instagram              
In May       Google officially changed the terms of service for their Jupyter Notebook colabs  banning the use of their colab service for the purpose of creating deepfakes               This came a few days after a VICE article had been published  claiming that  most deepfakes are non consensual porn  and that the main use of popular deepfake software DeepFaceLab  DFL    the most important technology powering the vast majority of this generation of deepfakes  which often was used in combination with Google colabs  would be to create non consensual pornography  by pointing to the fact that among many other well known examples of third party DFL implementations such as deepfakes commissioned by The Walt Disney Company  official music videos  and web series Sassy Justice by the creators of South Park  DFL s GitHub page also links to deepfake porn website Mr        Deepfakes and participants of the DFL Discord server also participate on Mr        Deepfakes

In November       China announced that deepfakes and other synthetically faked footage should bear a clear notice about their fakeness starting in       Failure to comply could be considered a crime the Cyberspace Administration of China stated on its website               The Chinese government seems to be reserving the right to prosecute both users and online video platforms failing to abide by the rules               The Cyberspace Administration of China  the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology  and the Ministry of Public Security jointly issued the Provision on the Administration of Deep Synthesis Internet Information Service in November                    China s updated Deep Synthesis Provisions  Administrative Provisions on Deep Synthesis in Internet Based Information Services  went into effect in January

In India  there are no direct laws or regulation on AI or deepfakes  but there are provisions under the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act            which can be looked at for legal remedies  and the new proposed Digital India Act will have a chapter on AI and deepfakes in particular  as per the MoS Rajeev Chandrasekhar              
In Europe  the European Union s      Artificial Intelligence Act  AI Act  takes a risk based approach to regulating AI systems  including deepfakes  It establishes categories of  unacceptable risk    high risk    specific limited or transparency risk   and  minimal risk  to determine the level of regulatory obligations for AI providers and users  However  the lack of clear definitions for these risk categories in the context of deepfakes creates potential challenges for effective implementation  Legal scholars have raised concerns about the classification of deepfakes intended for political misinformation or the creation of non consensual intimate imagery  Debate exists over whether such uses should always be considered  high risk  AI systems  which would lead to stricter regulatory requirements
