The Egypt office of the Egyptian Red Crescent launched a community awareness road safety campaign on Sunday  the world remembrance day for road traffic victims 
The event is co organised by the World Health Organisation  WHO   with contributions from the Ministry of Health and Population  the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Interior 
 Our main aim is to decrease the number of road accidents and victims   said Salma Bahgat  volunteer at the Egyptian Red Crescent and campaign organiser 
The launch was held on Sunday at the Egyptian Red Crescent headquarters  The campaign resumes on Monday when awareness flyer will be distributed at the Cairo Alexandria toll crossing  The flyers encourage passengers to wear seatbelts and stick to the speed limit 
 We were targeting passengers who take the ring road   Bahgat said   yet  due to our inability to access the ring road  we focused instead on Cairo s main toll gates to which the ring road leads  
The volunteers stationed at the gates will encourage people to wear their seatbelts on the road with the distribution of printed t shirts and giveaways 
Other events  scheduled to take place throughout the week  include similar awareness campaigns at the Ein Al Sokhna and Ismaileya gates 
A similar campaign is also scheduled to take place in Alexandria in December  Bahgat said  the Alexandria campaign will target the Courniche and Gamal Abdel Nasser road 
   children were killed in a train crash in the Manfalout area of Assiut on Saturday  The train collided with a school bus in a tragedy which shook the country 
 The crash made our campaign more tangible   Bahgat said  adding that Egyptians are now motivated and thus more likely to respond to the awareness campaign   Egyptians must realise that there is a problem which will be solved when they themselves address it before the government does  
Egypt is part of the WHO s Road Safety in Ten Countries  project   a project launched in      to expand road safety to    countries  Brazil  Cambodia  China  Egypt  India  Kenya  Mexico  the Russian Federation  Turkey and Vietnam 
According the WHO  out of every     thousand EgyptiansÂ  almost    will die on the road     per cent of road traffic victims die inside their vehicles  compared to    per cent which are pedestrians
