Surveillance is the monitoring of behavior  many activities  or information for the purpose of information gathering  influencing  managing  or directing                        This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment  such as closed circuit television  CCTV   or interception of electronically transmitted information like Internet traffic  Increasingly  governments may also obtain consumer data through the purchase of online information  effectively expanding surveillance capabilities through commercially available digital records             It can also include simple technical methods  such as human intelligence gathering and postal interception 
Surveillance is used by citizens  for instance for protecting their neighborhoods  It is widely used by governments for intelligence gathering  including espionage  prevention of crime  the protection of a process  person  group or object  or the investigation of crime  It is also used by criminal organizations to plan and commit crimes  and by businesses to gather intelligence on criminals  their competitors  suppliers or customers  Religious organizations charged with detecting heresy and heterodoxy may also carry out surveillance            
Auditors carry out a form of surveillance            
Surveillance can unjustifiably violate people s privacy and is often criticized by civil liberties activists             Democracies may have laws that seek to restrict governmental and private use of surveillance  whereas authoritarian governments seldom have any domestic restrictions 
Espionage is by definition covert and typically illegal according to the rules of the observed party  whereas most types of surveillance are overt and are considered legal or legitimate by state authorities  International espionage seems to be common among all types of countries

The vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of data and traffic on the Internet             In the United States for example  under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act  all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic  emails  web traffic  instant messaging  etc   are required to be available for unimpeded real time monitoring by federal law enforcement agencies                                     
There is far too much data on the Internet for human investigators to manually search through all of it  Therefore  automated Internet surveillance computers sift through the vast amount of intercepted Internet traffic to identify and report to human investigators the traffic that is considered interesting or suspicious  This process is regulated by targeting certain  trigger  words or phrases  visiting certain types of web sites  or communicating via email or online chat with suspicious individuals or groups              Billions of dollars per year are spent by agencies  such as the NSA  the FBI and the now defunct Information Awareness Office  to develop  purchase  implement  and operate systems such as Carnivore  NarusInsight  and ECHELON to intercept and analyze all of this data to extract only the information which is useful to law enforcement and intelligence agencies             
Computers can be a surveillance target because of the personal data stored on them  If someone is able to install software  such as the FBI s Magic Lantern and CIPAV  on a computer system  they can easily gain unauthorized access to this data  Such software could be installed physically or remotely              Another form of computer surveillance  known as van Eck phreaking  involves reading electromagnetic emanations from computing devices in order to extract data from them at distances of hundreds of meters                          The NSA runs a database known as  Pinwale   which stores and indexes large numbers of emails of both American citizens and foreigners                          Additionally  the NSA runs a program known as PRISM  which is a data mining system that gives the United States government direct access to information from technology companies  Through accessing this information  the government is able to obtain search history  emails  stored information  live chats  file transfers  and more  This program generated huge controversies in regards to surveillance and privacy  especially from U S  citizens                         

Telephones edit 
Main articles  Phone surveillance and Lawful interception
The official and unofficial tapping of telephone lines is widespread  In the United States for instance  the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act  CALEA  requires that all telephone and VoIP communications be available for real time wiretapping by Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies                                      Two major telecommunications companies in the U S  AT amp T Inc  and Verizon have contracts with the FBI  requiring them to keep their phone call records easily searchable and accessible for Federal agencies  in return for      million per year              Between      and       the FBI sent out more than          National Security Letters  ordering phone companies to hand over information about their customers  calling and Internet histories  About half of these letters requested information on U S  citizens             
Human agents are not required to monitor most calls  Speech to text software creates machine readable text from intercepted audio  which is then processed by automated call analysis programs  such as those developed by agencies such as the Information Awareness Office  or companies such as Verint  and Narus  which search for certain words or phrases  to decide whether to dedicate a human agent to the call             
Law enforcement and intelligence services in the United Kingdom and the United States possess technology to activate the microphones in cell phones remotely  by accessing phones  diagnostic or maintenance features in order to listen to conversations that take place near the person who holds the phone                                                                         
The StingRay tracker is an example of one of these tools used to monitor cell phone usage in the United States and the United Kingdom  Originally developed for counterterrorism purposes by the military  they work by broadcasting powerful signals that cause nearby cell phones to transmit their IMSI number  just as they would to normal cell phone towers  Once the phone is connected to the device  there is no way for the user to know that they are being tracked  The operator of the stingray is able to extract information such as location  phone calls  and text messages  but it is widely believed that the capabilities of the StingRay extend much further  A lot of controversy surrounds the StingRay because of its powerful capabilities and the secrecy that surrounds it             
Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect location data  The geographical location of a mobile phone  and thus the person carrying it  can be determined easily even when the phone is not being used  using a technique known as multilateration to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several cell towers near the owner of the phone                          The legality of such techniques has been questioned in the United States  in particular whether a court warrant is required              Records for one carrier alone  Sprint   showed that in a given year federal law enforcement agencies requested customer location data   million times             

The headquarters of UK intelligence activities is Government Communications Headquarters  Cheltenham  England       
In response to customers  privacy concerns in the post Edward Snowden era              Apple s iPhone   has been designed to disrupt investigative wiretapping efforts  The phone encrypts e mails  contacts  and photos with a code generated by a complex mathematical algorithm that is unique to an individual phone  and is inaccessible to Apple              The encryption feature on the iPhone   has drawn criticism from FBI director James B  Comey and other law enforcement officials since even lawful requests to access user content on the iPhone   will result in Apple supplying  gibberish  data that requires law enforcement personnel to either break the code themselves or to get the code from the phone s owner              Because the Snowden leaks demonstrated that American agencies can access phones anywhere in the world  privacy concerns in countries with growing markets for smart phones have intensified  providing a strong incentive for companies like Apple to address those concerns in order to secure their position in the global market             
Apple has made several moves to emphasize their concern for privacy  in order to appeal to more consumers  In       Apple stopped the use of permanent device identifiers  and in       they banned the ability of third parties to track on children s apps             
Although the CALEA requires telecommunications companies to build into their systems the ability to carry out a lawful wiretap  the law has not been updated to address the issue of smart phones and requests for access to e mails and metadata              The Snowden leaks show that the NSA has been taking advantage of this ambiguity in the law by collecting metadata on  at least hundreds of millions  of  incidental  targets from around the world              The NSA uses an analytic tool known as CO TRAVELER in order to track people whose movements intersect and to find any hidden connections with persons of interest             
The Snowden leaks have also revealed that the British Government Communications Headquarters  GCHQ  can access information collected by the NSA on American citizens  Once the data has been collected  the GCHQ can hold on to it for up to two years  The deadline can be extended with the permission of a  senior UK official                          

Cameras edit 
Main article  Closed circuit television

Surveillance cameras such as these are installed by the millions in many countries  and are nowadays monitored by automated computer programs instead of humans 
Surveillance cameras  or security cameras  are video cameras used for the purpose of observing an area  They are often connected to a recording device or IP network  and may be watched by a security guard or law enforcement officer  Cameras and recording equipment used to be relatively expensive and required human personnel to monitor camera footage  but analysis of footage has been made easier by automated software that organizes digital video footage into a searchable database  and by video analysis software  such as VIRAT and HumanID   The amount of footage is also drastically reduced by motion sensors which record only when motion is detected  With cheaper production techniques  surveillance cameras are simple and inexpensive enough to be used in home security systems  and for everyday surveillance  Video cameras are one of the most common methods of surveillance             
As of       there are about     million surveillance cameras worldwide  About     of these cameras are installed in Asia  The growth of CCTV has been slowing in recent years              In       China was reported to have a huge surveillance network of over     million CCTV cameras with     million new cameras expected to be installed in the next three years  many of which use facial recognition technology             
In the United States  the Department of Homeland Security awards billions of dollars per year in Homeland Security grants for local  state  and federal agencies to install modern video surveillance equipment  For example  the city of Chicago  Illinois  recently used a      million Homeland Security grant to install an additional     surveillance cameras  and connect them to a centralized monitoring center  along with its preexisting network of over      cameras  in a program known as Operation Virtual Shield  Speaking in       Chicago Mayor Richard Daley announced that Chicago would have a surveillance camera on every street corner by                               New York City received a      million grant towards the development of the Domain Awareness System              which is an interconnected system of sensors including        CCTV cameras used for continual surveillance of the city             by both police officers and artificial intelligence systems             
In the United Kingdom  the vast majority of video surveillance cameras are not operated by government bodies  but by private individuals or companies  especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses  According to      Freedom of Information Act requests  the total number of local government operated CCTV cameras was around        over the entirety of the UK              The prevalence of video surveillance in the UK is often overstated due to unreliable estimates being requoted                          for example one report in      extrapolated from a very small sample to estimate the number of cameras in the UK at     million  of which         were in Greater London               More reliable estimates put the number of private and local government operated cameras in the United Kingdom at around      million in                  
In the Netherlands  one example city where there are cameras is The Hague  There  cameras are placed in city districts in which the most illegal activity is concentrated  Examples are the red light districts and the train stations             
As part of China s Golden Shield Project  several U S  corporations  including IBM  General Electric  and Honeywell  have been working closely with the Chinese government to install millions of surveillance cameras throughout China  along with advanced video analytics and facial recognition software  which will identify and track individuals everywhere they go  They will be connected to a centralized database and monitoring station  which will  upon completion of the project  contain a picture of the face of every person in China  over     billion people              Lin Jiang Huai  the head of China s  Information Security Technology  office  which is in charge of the project   credits the surveillance systems in the United States and the U K  as the inspiration for what he is doing with the Golden Shield Project             

A payload surveillance camera manufactured by Controp and distributed to the U S  government by ADI Technologies
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  is funding a research project called Combat Zones That See that will link up cameras across a city to a centralized monitoring station  identify and track individuals and vehicles as they move through the city  and report  suspicious  activity  such as waving arms  looking side to side  standing in a group  etc               
At Super Bowl XXXV in January       police in Tampa  Florida  used Identix s facial recognition software  FaceIt  to scan the crowd for potential criminals and terrorists in attendance at the event              it found    people with pending arrest warrants              
Governments often initially claim that cameras are meant to be used for traffic control  but many of them end up using them for general surveillance      citation needed      For example  Washington  D C  had        traffic  cameras installed under this premise  and then after they were all in place  networked them all together and then granted access to the Metropolitan Police Department  so they could perform  day to day monitoring              
The development of centralized networks of CCTV cameras watching public areas linked to computer databases of people s pictures and identity  biometric data   able to track people s movements throughout the city  and identify whom they have been with has been argued by some to present a risk to civil liberties              Trapwire is an example of such a network             


Social network analysis edit 
A graph of the relationships between users on the social networking site Facebook  Social network analysis enables governments to gather detailed information about peoples  friends  family  and other contacts  Since much of this information is voluntarily made public by the users themselves  it is often considered to be a form of open source intelligence
One common form of surveillance is to create maps of social networks based on data from social networking sites such as Facebook  MySpace  Twitter as well as from traffic analysis information from phone call records such as those in the NSA call database              and others  These social network  maps  are then data mined to extract useful information such as personal interests  friendships  amp  affiliations  wants  beliefs  thoughts  and activities                                     
Many U S  government agencies such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA   the National Security Agency  NSA   and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  are investing heavily in research involving social network analysis                          The intelligence community believes that the biggest threat to U S  power comes from decentralized  leaderless  geographically dispersed groups of terrorists  subversives  extremists  and dissidents  These types of threats are most easily countered by finding important nodes in the network  and removing them  To do this requires a detailed map of the network                                     
Jason Ethier of Northeastern University  in his study of modern social network analysis  said the following of the Scalable Social Network Analysis Program developed by the Information Awareness Office 

The purpose of the SSNA algorithms program is to extend techniques of social network analysis to assist with distinguishing potential terrorist cells from legitimate groups of people     In order to be successful SSNA will require information on the social interactions of the majority of people around the globe  Since the Defense Department cannot easily distinguish between peaceful citizens and terrorists  it will be necessary for them to gather data on innocent civilians as well as on potential terrorists         Jason Ethier            
AT amp T developed a programming language called  Hancock   which is able to sift through enormous databases of phone call and Internet traffic records  such as the NSA call database  and extract  communities of interest  groups of people who call each other regularly  or groups that regularly visit certain sites on the Internet  AT amp T originally built the system to develop  marketing leads               but the FBI has regularly requested such information from phone companies such as AT amp T without a warrant              and  after using the data  stores all information received in its own databases  regardless of whether or not the information was ever useful in an investigation             
Some people believe that the use of social networking sites is a form of  participatory surveillance   where users of these sites are essentially performing surveillance on themselves  putting detailed personal information on public websites where it can be viewed by corporations and governments              In       about     of employers reported using social networking sites to collect personal data on prospective or current employees             

Biometric edit 
Fingerprints being scanned as part of the US VISIT program
Main article  Biometrics
Biometric surveillance is a technology that measures and analyzes human physical and or behavioral characteristics for authentication  identification  or screening purposes              Examples of physical characteristics include fingerprints  DNA  and facial patterns  Examples of mostly behavioral characteristics include gait  a person s manner of walking  or voice 
Facial recognition is the use of the unique configuration of a person s facial features to accurately identify them  usually from surveillance video  Both the Department of Homeland Security and DARPA are heavily funding research into facial recognition systems              The Information Processing Technology Office ran a program known as Human Identification at a Distance which developed technologies that are capable of identifying a person at up to          ft           m  by their facial features 
Another form of behavioral biometrics  based on affective computing  involves computers recognizing a person s emotional state based on an analysis of their facial expressions  how fast they are talking  the tone and pitch of their voice  their posture  and other behavioral traits  This might be used for instance to see if a person s behavior is suspect  looking around furtively   tense  or  angry  facial expressions  waving arms  etc               
A more recent development is DNA profiling  which looks at some of the major markers in the body s DNA to produce a match  The FBI is spending    billion to build a new biometric database  which will store DNA  facial recognition data  iris retina  eye  data  fingerprints  palm prints  and other biometric data of people living in the United States  The computers running the database are contained in an underground facility about the size of two American football fields                                     
The Los Angeles Police Department is installing automated facial recognition and license plate recognition devices in its squad cars  and providing handheld face scanners  which officers will use to identify people while on patrol                                     
Facial thermographs are in development  which allow machines to identify certain emotions in people such as fear or stress  by measuring the temperature generated by blood flow to different parts of the face              Law enforcement officers believe that this has potential for them to identify when a suspect is nervous  which might indicate that they are hiding something  lying  or worried about something             
In his paper in Ethics and Information Technology  Avi Marciano maps the harms caused by biometric surveillance  traces their theoretical origins  and brings these harms together in one integrative framework to elucidate their cumulative power  Marciano proposes four types of harms  Unauthorized use of bodily information  denial or limitation of access to physical spaces  bodily social sorting  and symbolic ineligibility through construction of marginality and otherness  Biometrics  social power  according to Marciano  derives from three main features  their complexity as  enigmatic technologies   their objective scientific image  and their increasing agency  particularly in the context of automatic decision making 

Aerial edit 
Further information  Surveillance aircraft and Wide area motion imagery
Micro Air Vehicle with attached surveillance camera
Aerial surveillance is the gathering of surveillance  usually visual imagery or video  from an airborne vehicle such as an unmanned aerial vehicle  helicopter  or spy plane  Military surveillance aircraft use a range of sensors  e g  radar  to monitor the battlefield 
Digital imaging technology  miniaturized computers  and numerous other technological advances over the past decade have contributed to rapid advances in aerial surveillance hardware such as micro aerial vehicles  forward looking infrared  and high resolution imagery capable of identifying objects at extremely long distances  For instance  the MQ   Reaper              a U S  drone plane used for domestic operations by the Department of Homeland Security  carries cameras that are capable of identifying an object the size of a milk carton from altitudes of        feet           km   and has forward looking infrared devices that can detect the heat from a human body at distances of up to    kilometers          mi               In an earlier instance of commercial aerial surveillance  the Killington Mountain ski resort hired  eye in the sky  aerial photography of its competitors  parking lots to judge the success of its marketing initiatives as it developed starting in the     s             

 HART program concept drawing from official IPTO  DARPA  official website
The United States Department of Homeland Security is in the process of testing UAVs to patrol the skies over the United States for the purposes of critical infrastructure protection  border patrol   transit monitoring   and general surveillance of the U S  population              Miami Dade police department ran tests with a vertical take off and landing UAV from Honeywell  which is planned to be used in SWAT operations              Houston s police department has been testing fixed wing UAVs for use in  traffic control              
The United Kingdom  as well  is working on plans to build up a fleet of surveillance UAVs ranging from micro aerial vehicles to full size drones  to be used by police forces throughout the U K             
In addition to their surveillance capabilities  MAVs are capable of carrying tasers for  crowd control   or weapons for killing enemy combatants             
Programs such as the Heterogeneous Aerial Reconnaissance Team program developed by DARPA have automated much of the aerial surveillance process  They have developed systems consisting of large teams drone planes that pilot themselves  automatically decide who is  suspicious  and how to go about monitoring them  coordinate their activities with other drones nearby  and notify human operators if something suspicious is occurring  This greatly increases the amount of area that can be continuously monitored  while reducing the number of human operators required  Thus a swarm of automated  self directing drones can automatically patrol a city and track suspicious individuals  reporting their activities back to a centralized monitoring station                                     
In addition  researchers also investigate possibilities of autonomous surveillance by large groups of micro aerial vehicles stabilized by decentralized bio inspired swarming rules                         

Corporate edit 
Main article  Corporate surveillance
Corporate surveillance is the monitoring of a person or group s behavior by a corporation  The data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations  but is also regularly shared with government agencies  It can be used as a form of business intelligence  which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and or services to be desirable by their customers  Although there is a common belief that monitoring can increase productivity  it can also create consequences such as increasing chances of deviant behavior and creating punishments that are not equitable to their actions  Additionally  monitoring can cause resistance and backlash because it insinuates an employer s suspicion and lack of trust             

Data mining and profiling edit 
Data mining is the application of statistical techniques and programmatic algorithms to discover previously unnoticed relationships within the data  Data profiling in this context is the process of assembling information about a particular individual or group in order to generate a profile        that is  a picture of their patterns and behavior  Data profiling can be an extremely powerful tool for psychological and social network analysis  A skilled analyst can discover facts about a person that they might not even be consciously aware of themselves             
Economic  such as credit card purchases  and social  such as telephone calls and emails  transactions in modern society create large amounts of stored data and records  In the past  this data was documented in paper records  leaving a  paper trail   or was simply not documented at all  Correlation of paper based records was a laborious process it required human intelligence operators to manually dig through documents  which was time consuming and incomplete  at best 
But today many of these records are electronic  resulting in an  electronic trail   Every use of a bank machine  payment by credit card  use of a phone card  call from home  checked out library book  rented video  or otherwise complete recorded transaction generates an electronic record  Public records such as birth  court  tax and other records are increasingly being digitized and made available online  In addition  due to laws like CALEA  web traffic and online purchases are also available for profiling  Electronic record keeping makes data easily collectable  storable  and accessible so that high volume  efficient aggregation and analysis is possible at significantly lower costs 
Information relating to many of these individual transactions is often easily available because it is generally not guarded in isolation  since the information  such as the title of a movie a person has rented  might not seem sensitive  However  when many such transactions are aggregated they can be used to assemble a detailed profile revealing the actions  habits  beliefs  locations frequented  social connections  and preferences of the individual  This profile is then used  by programs such as ADVISE             and TALON  to determine whether the person is a military  criminal  or political threat 
In addition to its own aggregation and profiling tools  the government is able to access information from third parties for example  banks  credit companies or employers  etc  by requesting access informally  by compelling access through the use of subpoenas or other procedures              or by purchasing data from commercial data aggregators or data brokers  The United States has spent      million on its    planned fusion centers  which are national network of surveillance centers that are located in over    states  The centers will collect and analyze vast amounts of data on U S  citizens  It will get this data by consolidating personal information from sources such as state driver s licensing agencies  hospital records  criminal records  school records  credit bureaus  banks  etc  and placing this information in a centralized database that can be accessed from all of the centers  as well as other federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies              
Under United States v  Miller         data held by third parties is generally not subject to Fourth Amendment warrant requirements 

Human operatives edit 
A  tail may surreptitiously track and report on the movements and contacts of a person of interest  Such following by one or more people may provide useful in formation in relatively densely populated urban environments              
Organizations that have enemies who wish to gather information about the groups  members or activities face the issue of potential infiltration              
In addition to operatives  infiltrating an organization  the surveilling party may exert pressure on certain members of the target organization to act as informants  i e   to disclose the information they hold on the organization and its members                            
Fielding operatives is very expensive  and governments with wide reaching electronic surveillance tools at their disposal  rather than gathering the sort of information which operatives can provide  may use less problematic forms of surveillance such as those mentioned above  Nevertheless  the use of human infiltrators remains common  For instance  in      documents surfaced showing that the FBI planned to field a total of        undercover agents and informants in response to an anti terrorism directive  issued by President George W  Bush in       that ordered intelligence and law enforcement agencies to increase their HUMINT capabilities              
In some home invasion cases  thieves may use  casing surveillance  to determine if a victim s property such as a collection of firearms are worth stealing              

Satellite imagery edit 
Main article  Reconnaissance satellite
On May           the U S  Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell authorized the National Applications Office  NAO  of the Department of Homeland Security to allow local  state  and domestic Federal agencies to access imagery from military intelligence Reconnaissance satellites and Reconnaissance aircraft sensors which can now be used to observe the activities of U S  citizens  The satellites and aircraft sensors will be able to penetrate cloud cover  detect chemical traces  and identify objects in buildings and  underground bunkers   and will provide real time video at much higher resolutions than the still images produced by programs such as Google Earth                                                                               

Identification and credentials edit 
A card containing an identification number
One of the simplest forms of identification is the carrying of credentials  Some nations have an identity card system to aid identification  whilst others are considering it but face public opposition  Other documents  such as passports  driver s licenses  library cards  banking or credit cards are also used to verify identity 
If the form of the identity card is  machine readable   usually using an encoded magnetic stripe or identification number  such as a Social Security number   it corroborates the subject s identifying data  In this case it may create an electronic trail when it is checked and scanned  which can be used in profiling  as mentioned above 

Wireless tracking edit 
This section refers to methods that involve the monitoring of tracking devices through the aid of wireless signals 

Mobile phones edit 
Mobile carrier antennas are also commonly used to collect geolocation data on mobile phones  The geographical location of a powered mobile phone  and thus the person carrying it  can be determined easily  whether it is being used or not   using a technique known as multilateration to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several cell towers near the owner of the phone                          Dr  Victor Kappeler               of Eastern Kentucky University indicates that police surveillance is a strong concern  stating the following statistics from      

Of the         law enforcement requests made to Verizon         of these requests were for  content  or  location  information not just cell phone numbers or IP addresses  Content information included the actual text of messages  emails and the wiretapping of voice or messaging content in real time 
A comparatively new off the shelf surveillance device is an IMSI catcher  a telephone eavesdropping device used to intercept mobile phone traffic and track the movement of mobile phone users  Essentially a  fake  mobile tower acting between the target mobile phone and the service provider s real towers  it is considered a man in the middle  MITM  attack  IMSI catchers are used in some countries by law enforcement and intelligence agencies  but their use has raised significant civil liberty and privacy concerns and is strictly regulated in some countries              
In March       British daily The Guardian  based on the claims of a whistleblower  accused the government of Saudi Arabia of exploiting global mobile telecom network weaknesses to spy on its citizens traveling around the United States               The data shared by the whistleblower in support of the claims  showed that a systematic spying campaign was being run by the kingdom exploiting the flaws of SS   a global messaging system  The data showed that millions of secret tracking commands originated from Saudi in a duration of four months  starting from November                   

RFID tagging edit 
RFID chip pulled from a new credit card
Radio frequency identification  RFID  tagging is the use of very small electronic devices  called  RFID tags   which are applied to or incorporated into a product  animal  or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves  The tags can be read from several meters away  They are extremely inexpensive  costing a few cents per piece  so they can be inserted into many types of everyday products without significantly increasing the price  and can be used to track and identify these objects for a variety of purposes 
Some companies appear to be  tagging  their workers by incorporating RFID tags in employee ID badges  Workers in U K  considered strike action in protest of having themselves tagged  they felt that it was dehumanizing to have all of their movements tracked with RFID chips                   vague      Some critics have expressed fears that people will soon be tracked and scanned everywhere they go                On the other hand  RFID tags in newborn baby ID bracelets put on by hospitals have foiled kidnappings              
In a      editorial  CNET News com s chief political correspondent  Declan McCullagh  speculated that  soon  every object that is purchased  and perhaps ID cards  will have RFID devices in them  which would respond with information about people as they walk past scanners  what type of phone they have  what type of shoes they have on  which books they are carrying  what credit cards or membership cards they have  etc    This information could be used for identification  tracking  or targeted marketing  As of          update       this has largely not come to pass              


RFID tagging on humans edit 
Main article  Microchip implant  human 
Hand with planned insertion point for Verichip device
A human microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit device or RFID transponder encased in silicate glass and implanted in the body of a human being   A subdermal implant typically contains a unique ID number that can be linked to information contained in an external database  such as personal identification  medical history  medications  allergies  and contact information 
Several types of microchips have been developed in order to control and monitor certain types of people  such as criminals  political figures and spies      clarification needed      a  killer  tracking chip patent was filed at the German Patent and Trademark Office  DPMA  around May      
Verichip is an RFID device produced by a company called Applied Digital Solutions  ADS   Verichip is slightly larger than a grain of rice  and is injected under the skin  The injection reportedly feels similar to receiving a shot  The chip is encased in glass  and stores a  VeriChip Subscriber Number  which the scanner uses to access their personal information  via the Internet  from Verichip Inc  s database  the  Global VeriChip Subscriber Registry   Thousands of people have already had them inserted               In Mexico  for example      workers at the Attorney General s office were required to have the chip injected for identity verification and access control purposes                           
Implantable microchips have also been used in healthcare settings  but ethnographic researchers have identified a number of ethical problems with such uses  these problems include unequal treatment  diminished trust  and possible endangerment of patients              

Radar edit 
This section is an excerpt from Perimeter surveillance radar  edit 
Perimeter surveillance radar  PSR  is a class of radar sensors that monitor activity surrounding or on critical infrastructure areas such as airports               seaports  military installations  national borders  refineries and other critical industry and the like   Such radars are characterized by their ability to detect movement at ground level of targets such as an individual walking or crawling towards a facility   Such radars typically have ranges of several hundred metres to over    kilometres              

Alternate technologies include laser based systems  These have the potential for very high target position accuracy  however they are less effective in the presence of fog and other obscurants 
Geolocation devices edit

In the U S   police have planted hidden GPS tracking devices in people s vehicles to monitor their movements               without a warrant               In early       they were arguing in court that they have the right to do this              
Several cities are running pilot projects to require parolees to wear GPS devices to track their movements when they get out of prison              

Devices edit 
See also  United States v  Spy Factory  Inc 
Covert listening devices and video devices  or  bugs   are hidden electronic devices which are used to capture  record  and or transmit data to a receiving party such as a law enforcement agency 
The U S  has run numerous domestic intelligence operations  such as COINTELPRO  which have bugged the homes  offices  and vehicles of thousands of U S  citizens  usually political activists  subversives  and criminals              
Law enforcement and intelligence services in the U K  and the United States possess technology to remotely activate the microphones in cell phones  by accessing the phone s diagnostic maintenance features  in order to listen to conversations that take place nearby the person who holds the phone                                     

Postal services edit 
As more people use faxes and e mail the significance of surveilling the postal system is decreasing  in favor of Internet and telephone surveillance  But interception of post is still an available option for law enforcement and intelligence agencies  in certain circumstances               This is not a common practice  however  and entities like the US Army require high levels of approval to conduct              
The U S  Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation have performed twelve separate mail opening campaigns targeted towards U S  citizens  In one of these programs  more than         communications were intercepted  opened  and photographed                           

Stakeout edit 
 Stakeout  redirects here  For other uses  see Stakeout  disambiguation  
A stakeout is the coordinated surveillance of a location or person  Stakeouts are generally performed covertly and for the purpose of gathering evidence related to criminal activity  The term derives from the practice by land surveyors of using survey stakes to measure out an area before the main building project begins 

Internet of things edit 
The Internet of Things  IoT   is a network of physical devices  These devices can collect data to one another without human intervention  IoTs can be used for identification  monitoring  location tracking  and health tracking               While IoTs can be used as time saving tools that make activities simpler  they raise the concern of government surveillance and privacy regarding how data will be used              

Controversy edit 
Graffiti expressing concern about the proliferation of video surveillance
Support edit 
Supporters of surveillance systems believe that these tools can help protect society from terrorists and criminals  They argue that surveillance can reduce crime by three means  by deterrence  by observation  and by reconstruction  Surveillance can deter by increasing the chance of being caught  and by revealing the modus operandi  This requires a minimal level of invasiveness              
Another method on how surveillance can be used to fight criminal activity is by linking the information stream obtained from them to a recognition system  for instance  a camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system   This can for instance auto recognize fugitives and direct police to their location 
A distinction here has to be made however on the type of surveillance employed  Some people that support video surveillance in city streets may not support indiscriminate telephone taps and vice versa  Besides the types  the way in which this surveillance is done also matters a lot  i e  indiscriminate telephone taps are supported by much fewer people than say telephone taps done only to people suspected of engaging in illegal activities 
Surveillance can also be used to give human operatives a tactical advantage through improved situational awareness  or through the use of automated processes  i e  video analytics  Surveillance can help reconstruct an incident and prove guilt through the availability of footage for forensics experts  Surveillance can also influence subjective security if surveillance resources are visible or if the consequences of surveillance can be felt 
Some of the surveillance systems  such as the camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system mentioned above  can also have other uses besides countering criminal activity  For instance  it can help in retrieving runaway children  abducted or missing adults and mentally disabled people  
Other supporters simply believe that there is nothing that can be done about the loss of privacy  and that people must become accustomed to having no privacy  As Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy said   You have zero privacy anyway  Get over it                            
Another common argument is   If you aren t doing something wrong then you don t have anything to fear   That is   one does not have a right to privacy regarding illegal activities  while those following the law suffer no harm from surveillance and so have no standing to object to it  Beyond the heroically self serving identification of what is wrong with what is illegal  the ethical fly in this ointment is the tacit premise that the individual has no duty to preserve the health of the state the antithesis of the principle that only the consent of the governed can adequately serve as the moral foundation of a  just  state and warrant the vast gulf between its power  and agency  and that of the individual               

Opposition edit

An elaborate graffito in Columbus  Ohio  depicting state surveillance of telecommunications 
With the advent of programs such as the Total Information Awareness program and ADVISE  technologies such as high speed surveillance computers and biometrics software  and laws such as the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act  governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of their subjects               Many civil rights and privacy groups  such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and American Civil Liberties Union  have expressed concern that by allowing continual increases in government surveillance of citizens we will end up in a mass surveillance society  with extremely limited  or non existent political and or personal freedoms  Fears such as this have led to numerous lawsuits such as Hepting v  AT amp T                           
Some critics state that the claim made by supporters should be modified to read   As long as we do what we re told  we have nothing to fear   For instance  a person who is part of a political group which opposes the policies of the national government  might not want the government to know their names and what they have been reading  so that the government cannot easily subvert their organization  arrest  or kill them  Other critics state that while a person might not have anything to hide right now  the government might later implement policies that they do wish to oppose  and that opposition might then be impossible due to mass surveillance enabling the government to identify and remove political threats  Further  other critics point to the fact that most people do have things to hide  For example  if a person is looking for a new job  they might not want their current employer to know this  Also if an employer wishes total privacy to watch over their own employee and secure their financial information it may become impossible  and they may not wish to hire those under surveillance 
In December       the Government of China took steps to oppose widespread surveillance by security company cameras  webcams  and IP cameras after tens of thousands were made accessible for internet viewing by IT company Qihoo             

Totalitarianism edit

Programs such as the Total Information Awareness program  and laws such as the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act have led many groups to fear that society is moving towards a state of mass surveillance with severely limited personal  social  political freedoms  where dissenting individuals or groups will be strategically removed in COINTELPRO like purges                           
Kate Martin  of the Center For National Security Studies said of the use of military spy satellites being used to monitor the activities of U S  citizens   They are laying the bricks one at a time for a police state               
Some point to the blurring of lines between public and private places  and the privatization of places traditionally seen as public  such as shopping malls and industrial parks  as illustrating the increasing legality of collecting personal information               Traveling through many public places such as government offices is hardly optional for most people  yet consumers have little choice but to submit to companies  surveillance practices               Surveillance techniques are not created equal  among the many biometric identification technologies  for instance  face recognition requires the least cooperation  Unlike automatic fingerprint reading  which requires an individual to press a finger against a machine  this technique is subtle and requires little to no consent              

Psychological social effects edit 
See also  Hawthorne effect
Some critics  such as Michel Foucault  believe that in addition to its obvious function of identifying and capturing individuals who are committing undesirable acts  surveillance also functions to create in everyone a feeling of always being watched  so that they become self policing  This allows the State to control the populace without having to resort to physical force  which is expensive and otherwise problematic              
With the development of digital technology  individuals have become increasingly perceptible to one another  as surveillance becomes virtual  Online surveillance is the utilization of the internet to observe one s activity               Corporations  citizens  and governments participate in tracking others  behaviours for motivations that arise out of business relations  to curiosity  to legality  In her book Superconnected  Mary Chayko differentiates between two types of surveillance  vertical and horizontal               Vertical surveillance occurs when there is a dominant force  such as the government that is attempting to control or regulate the actions of a given society  Such powerful authorities often justify their incursions as a means to protect society from threats of violence or terrorism  Some individuals question when this becomes an infringement on civil rights              
Horizontal diverges from vertical surveillance as the tracking shifts from an authoritative source to an everyday figure  such as a friend  coworker  or stranger that is interested in one s mundane activities               Individuals leave traces of information when they are online that reveal their interests and desires of which others observe  While this can allow people to become interconnected and develop social connections online  it can also increase potential risk to harm  such as cyberbullying or censoring stalking by strangers  reducing privacy              
In addition  Simone Browne argues that surveillance wields an immense racializing quality such that it operates as  racializing surveillance   Browne uses racializing surveillance to refer to moments when enactments of surveillance are used to reify boundaries  borders  and bodies along racial lines and where the outcome is discriminatory treatment of those who are negatively racialized by such surveillance  Browne argues racializing surveillance pertains to policing what is  in or out of place                            

Privacy edit 
Numerous civil rights groups and privacy groups oppose surveillance as a violation of people s right to privacy  Such groups include  Electronic Privacy Information Center  Electronic Frontier Foundation  American Civil Liberties Union and Privacy International 
There have been several lawsuits such as Hepting v  AT amp T and EPIC v  Department of Justice by groups or individuals  opposing certain surveillance activities 
Legislative proceedings such as those that took place during the Church Committee  which investigated domestic intelligence programs such as COINTELPRO  have also weighed the pros and cons of surveillance 

Court cases edit 
People vs  Diaz        was a court case in the realm of cell phone privacy  even though the decision was later overturned  In this case  Gregory Diaz was arrested during a sting operation for attempting to sell ecstasy   During his arrest  police searched Diaz s phone and found more incriminating evidence including SMS text messages and photographs depicting illicit activities   During his trial  Diaz attempted to have the information from his cell phone removed from evidence  but the courts deemed it as lawful and Diaz s appeal was denied on the California State Court level and  later  the Supreme Court level   Just three short years after  this decision was overturned in the case Riley vs  California                     
Riley vs  California        was a U S  Supreme Court case in which a man was arrested for his involvement in a drive by shooting   A few days after the shooting the police made an arrest of the suspect  Riley   and  during the arrest  the police searched him   However  this search was not only of Riley s person  but also the police opened and searched his cell phone  finding pictures of other weapons  drugs  and of Riley showing gang signs   In court  the question arose whether searching the phone was lawful or if the search was protected by the  th amendment of the constitution   The decision held that the search of Riley s cell phone during the arrest was illegal  and that it was protected by the  th Amendment              

Countersurveillance  inverse surveillance  sousveillance edit 
Countersurveillance is the practice of avoiding surveillance or making surveillance difficult  Developments in the late twentieth century have caused counter surveillance to dramatically grow in both scope and complexity  such as the Internet  increasing prevalence of electronic security systems  high altitude  and possibly armed  UAVs  and large corporate and government computer databases               Other examples include encrypted messenger apps such as Signal                           and privacy cryptocurrencies such as Monero                           and ZCash              
Inverse surveillance is the practice of the reversal of surveillance on other individuals or groups  e g   citizens photographing police   Well known examples include George Holliday s recording of the Rodney King beating and the organization Copwatch  which attempts to monitor police officers to prevent police brutality   Counter surveillance can be also used in applications to prevent corporate spying  or to track other criminals by certain criminal entities  It can also be used to deter stalking methods used by various entities and organizations 
Sousveillance is inverse surveillance  involving the recording by private individuals  rather than government or corporate entities              

Popular culture edit 
In literature edit

V for Vendetta  a British graphic novel written by Alan Moore
David Egger s novel The Circle exhibits a world where a single company called  The Circle  produces all of the latest and highest quality technologies from computers and smartphones  to surveillance cameras known as  See Change cameras   This company became associated with politics when it started a movement where politicians went  transparent  by wearing See Change cameras to prevent the public from keeping secrets about their daily work activity  In this society  sharing personal information and experiences becomes mandatory because The Circle believes everyone should have access to all information freely  However  as Eggers illustrates  this takes a toll on the individuals and disrupts power between governments and private companies  The Circle presents extreme ideologies surrounding mandatory surveillance  Eamon Bailey  one of the Wise Men  or founders of The Circle  believes that possessing the tools to access information about anything or anyone  should be a human right given to all of the world s citizens               By eliminating all secrets  any behaviour that has been deemed shameful will either become normalized or no longer considered shocking  Negative actions will eventually be eradicated from society altogether  through the fear of being exposed to other citizens              This would be achieved partly by everyone going transparent  which Bailey highly supports  However  none of the Wise Men ever became transparent themselves  One primary goal of The Circle is to have all of the world s information filtered through The Circle  a process they call  Completion                A single  private company would then have full access and control over all information and privacy of individuals and governments  Ty Gospodinov  the first founder of The Circle  has significant concerns about the completion of the circle  He warns that this step would give The Circle too much power and control  quickly leading to totalitarianism
