Nvidia s attempt to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September      failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny  leading to the termination of the deal in February      in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition                          In       Nvidia became the seventh public U S  company to be valued at over    trillion              and the company s valuation has increased rapidly since then amid growing demand for data center chips with AI capabilities in the midst of the AI boom                          In June       for one day  Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world s most valuable publicly traded company  with a market capitalization of over      trillion             


History edit 
Founding edit 
The Denny s roadside diner in San Jose  California  where Nvidia s three co founders agreed to start the company in late     
Nvidia s former headquarters which was home to the company through most of its pre AI period  still in use 
Aerial view of Endeavor  the first of the two new Nvidia headquarters buildings  in Santa Clara  California  in       Apple Park is visible in the distance

Nvidia was founded on April                                              by Jensen Huang  who  as of          update       remains CEO   a Taiwanese American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD  Chris Malachowsky  an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems  and Curtis Priem  who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems                          In late       the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose                                                  
At the time  Malachowsky and Priem were frustrated with Sun s management and were looking to leave  but Huang was on  firmer ground               in that he was already running his own division at LSI              The three co founders discussed a vision of the future which was so compelling that Huang decided to leave LSI             and become the chief executive officer of their new startup             
The three co founders envisioned  graphics based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general purpose computing methods              As Huang later explained   We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume  Those two conditions don t happen very often  Video games was our killer app   a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R amp D to solve massive computational problems               
The first problem was who would quit first  Huang s wife  Lori  did not want him to resign from LSI unless Malachowsky resigned from Sun at the same time  and Malachowsky s wife  Melody  felt the same way about Huang              Priem broke that deadlock by resigning first from Sun  effective December                       According to Priem  this put pressure on Huang and Malachowsky to not leave him to  flail alone   so they gave notice too               Huang left LSI and  officially joined Priem on February      which was also Huang s   th birthday  while Malachowsky left Sun in early March               In early       the three founders began working together on their new startup in Priem s townhouse in Fremont  California               
With         in the bank  the company was born              The company subsequently received     million of venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital  Sutter Hill Ventures and others              
During the late     s  Nvidia was one of    startup companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future               Only two survived  Nvidia and ATI Technologies  the latter of which merged into AMD             
Nvidia initially had no name               Priem s first idea was  Primal Graphics   a syllabic abbreviation of two of the founders  last names  but that left out Huang              They soon discovered it was impossible to create a workable name with syllables from all three founders  names  after considering  Huaprimal    Prihuamal    Malluapri   etc               The next idea came from Priem s idea for the name of Nvidia s first product                Priem originally wanted to call it the  GXNV   as in the  next version  of the GX graphics chips which he had worked on at Sun               Then Huang told Priem to  drop the GX   resulting in the name  NV                Priem made a list of words with the letters  NV  in them              At one point  Malachowsky and Priem wanted to call the company NVision  but that name was already taken by a manufacturer of toilet paper              Both Priem             and Huang have taken credit for coming up with the name Nvidia              from  invidia   the Latin word for  envy               
After the company outgrew Priem s townhouse  its original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale  California             

First graphics accelerator edit 
Nvidia s first graphics accelerator  the NV   was designed to process quadrilateral primitives  forward texture mapping   a feature that set it apart from competitors  who preferred triangle primitives              However  when Microsoft introduced the DirectX platform  it chose not to support any other graphics software and announced that its Direct D API would exclusively support triangles                          As a result  the NV  failed to gain traction in the market             
Nvidia had also entered into a partnership with Sega to supply the graphics chip for the Dreamcast console and worked on the project for about a year  However  Nvidia s technology was already lagging behind competitors  This placed the company in a difficult position  continue working on a chip that was likely doomed to fail or abandon the project  risking financial collapse             
In a pivotal moment  Sega s president  Shoichiro Irimajiri  visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast  However  Irimajiri believed in Nvidia s potential and persuaded Sega s management to invest    million into the company  Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat  and that Irimajiri s  understanding and generosity gave us six months to live              
In       Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia s employees thereby reducing headcount from     to    and focused the company s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives  the RIVA                               By the time the RIVA     was released in August       Nvidia had only enough money left for one month s payroll              The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia s unofficial company motto   Our company is thirty days from going out of business               Huang began internal presentations to Nvidia staff with those words for many years             
Nvidia sold about a million RIVA     units within four months              and used the revenue to fund development of its next generation of products              In       the release of the RIVA TNT helped solidify Nvidia s reputation as a leader in graphics technology             

Public company edit 
Nvidia went public on January                                                Investing in Nvidia after it had already failed to deliver on its contract turned out to be Irimajiri s best decision as Sega s president  After Irimajiri left Sega in       Sega sold its Nvidia stock for     million             
In late       Nvidia released the GeForce      NV     its first product expressly marketed as a GPU  which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting  T amp L  to consumer level  D hardware  Running at          MHz and featuring four pixel pipelines  it implemented advanced video acceleration  motion compensation  and hardware sub picture alpha blending  The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin 
Due to the success of its products  Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft s Xbox game console  which earned Nvidia a      million advance  However  the project took many of its best engineers away from other projects  In the short term this did not matter  and the GeForce  GTS shipped in the summer of       In December       Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one time rival  dfx  a pioneer in consumer  D graphics technology leading the field from the mid     s until                               The acquisition process was finalized in April

Open source software support edit 
See also  Free and open source graphics device driver  Mesa  D  nouveau  software   and OpenPOWER Foundation
Until September           Nvidia had not published any documentation for its advanced hardware               meaning that programmers could not write free and open source device driver for its products without resorting to reverse engineering 
Instead  Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for X Org and an open source library that interfaces with the Linux  FreeBSD or Solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software  Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open source driver that only supports two dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X Org distribution              
The proprietary nature of Nvidia s drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free software communities  In a      talk  Linus Torvalds  in criticism of Nvidia s approach towards Linux  raised the finger and stated  Nvidia  fuck you                             Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open source drivers and regard Nvidia s insistence on providing nothing more than a binary only driver as inadequate  given that competing manufacturers such as Intel offer support and documentation for open source developers and that others  like AMD  release partial documentation and provide some active development                           
Nvidia only provides x   x   and ARMv  A versions of their proprietary driver  as a result  features like CUDA are unavailable on other platforms               Some users claim that Nvidia s Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions  like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time  but the company has not commented on these accusations              
In       with Maxwell GPUs  Nvidia started to require firmware by them to unlock all features of its graphics cards                                        
On May           Nvidia announced that they are opensourcing their GPU kernel modules                                         Support for Nvidia s firmware was implemented in nouveau in       which allows proper power management and GPU reclocking for Turing and newer graphics card generations                           

Deep learning edit 
Nvidia GPUs are used in deep learning  and accelerated analytics due to Nvidia s CUDA software platform and API which allows programmers to utilize the higher number of cores present in GPUs to parallelize BLAS operations which are extensively used in machine learning algorithms              They were included in many Tesla  Inc  vehicles before Musk announced at Tesla Autonomy Day in      that the company developed its own SoC and full self driving computer now and would stop using Nvidia hardware for their vehicles                            These GPUs are used by researchers  laboratories  tech companies and enterprise companies               In       Nvidia was involved in what was called the  big bang  of deep learning   as deep learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units  GPUs                 That year  the Google Brain team used Nvidia GPUs to create deep neural networks capable of machine learning  where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep learning systems by about     times              

DGX edit 
Main article  Nvidia DGX
DGX is a line of supercomputers by Nvidia 
In April       Nvidia produced the DGX   based on an   GPU cluster  to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software               Nvidia gifted its first DGX   to OpenAI in August      to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability of reducing processing time from six days to two hours                            It also developed Nvidia Tesla K   and P    GPU based virtual machines  which are available through Google Cloud  which Google installed in November                    Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia s Tesla K  s  each containing      processing cores  Later that year  AWS s P  instance was produced using up to    Nvidia Tesla K   GPUs  That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson               called IBM PowerAI                            Nvidia also offers its own Nvidia Deep Learning software development kit               In       the GPUs were also brought online at the Riken Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu               The company s deep learning technology led to a boost in its      earnings              
In May       researchers at the artificial intelligence department of Nvidia realized the possibility that a robot can learn to perform a job simply by observing the person doing the same job  They have created a system that  after a short revision and testing  can already be used to control the universal robots of the next generation  In addition to GPU manufacturing  Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high performance applications              

Robotics edit 
In       Nvidia unveiled  Omniverse   a virtual environment designed for engineers               Nvidia also open sourced Isaac Sim  which makes use of this Omniverse to train robots through simulations that mimic the physics of the robots and the real world                           
In       Huang oriented Nvidia s focus towards humanoid robots and self driving cars  which he expects to gain widespread adoption                           
In       Nvidia announced Isaac GR  T N   an open source  foundation model  designed to expedite the development and capabilities of humanoid robots   Neura Robotics   X Technologies and Vention are among the first companies to use the model                                        

Inception Program edit

Controversies edit

GTX     hardware specifications edit 
Issues with the GeForce GTX     s specifications were first brought up by users when they found out that the cards  while featuring        GB of memory  rarely accessed memory over the          GB boundary  Further testing and investigation eventually led to Nvidia issuing a statement that the card s initially announced specifications had been altered without notice before the card was made commercially available  and that the card took a performance hit once memory over the          GB limit were put into use                                        
The card s back end hardware specifications  initially announced as being identical to those of the GeForce GTX      differed in the amount of L  cache            MB versus        MB in the GeForce GTX      and the number of ROPs     versus    in the       Additionally  it was revealed that the card was designed to access its memory as a          GB section  plus a          GB one  access to the latter being   times slower than the first one               The company then went on to promise a specific driver modification to alleviate the performance issues produced by the cutbacks suffered by the card               However  Nvidia later clarified that the promise had been a miscommunication and there would be no specific driver update for the GTX                   Nvidia claimed that it would assist customers who wanted refunds in obtaining them               On February           Nvidia CEO Jen Hsun Huang went on record in Nvidia s official blog to apologize for the incident               In February      a class action lawsuit alleging false advertising was filed against Nvidia and Gigabyte Technology in the U S  District Court for Northern California                           
Nvidia revealed that it is able to disable individual units  each containing          KB of L  cache and   ROPs  without disabling whole memory controllers               This comes at the cost of dividing the memory bus into high speed and low speed segments that cannot be accessed at the same time unless one segment is reading while the other segment is writing because the L  ROP unit managing both of the GDDR  controllers shares the read return channel and the write data bus between the two GDDR  controllers and itself               This is used in the GeForce GTX      which therefore can be described as having     GB in its high speed segment on a     bit bus and     GB in a low speed segment on a    bit bus              
On July           Nvidia agreed to a preliminary settlement of the U S  class action lawsuit               offering a     refund on GTX     purchases  The agreed upon refund represents the portion of the cost of the storage and performance capabilities the consumers assumed they were obtaining when they purchased the card              

GeForce Partner Program edit 
Main article  GeForce Partner ProgramThe Nvidia GeForce Partner Program was a marketing program designed to provide partnering companies with benefits such as public relations support  video game bundling  and marketing development funds               The program proved to be controversial  with complaints about it possibly being an anti competitive practice              
First announced in a blog post on March                       it was canceled on May                      

Hardware Unboxed edit 
On December           Nvidia told YouTube tech reviewer Steven Walton of Hardware Unboxed that it would no longer supply him with GeForce Founders Edition graphics card review units                            In a Twitter message  Hardware Unboxed said   Nvidia have officially decided to ban us from receiving GeForce Founders Edition GPU review samples  Their reasoning is that we are focusing on rasterization instead of ray tracing  They have said they will revisit this  should your editorial direction change                

In emails that were disclosed by Walton from Nvidia Senior PR Manager Bryan Del Rizzo  Nvidia had said    your GPU reviews and recommendations have continued to focus singularly on rasterization performance  and you have largely discounted all of the other technologies we offer gamers  It is very clear from your community commentary that you do not see things the same way that we  gamers  and the rest of the industry do              TechSpot  partner site of Hardware Unboxed  said   this and other related incidents raise serious questions around journalistic independence and what they are expecting of reviewers when they are sent products for an unbiased opinion               
A number of technology reviewers came out strongly against Nvidia s move                            Linus Sebastian  of Linus Tech Tips  titled the episode of his weekly WAN Show   NVIDIA might ACTUALLY be EVIL                  and was highly critical of the company s move to dictate specific outcomes of technology reviews               The review site Gamers Nexus said it was   Nvidia s latest decision to shoot both its feet  They ve now made it so that any reviewers covering RT will become subject to scrutiny from untrusting viewers who will suspect subversion by the company  Shortsighted self own from NVIDIA               
Two days later  Nvidia reversed their stance                            Hardware Unboxed sent out a Twitter message   I just received an email from Nvidia apologizing for the previous email  amp  they ve now walked everything back                             On December     Hardware Unboxed released a video explaining the controversy from their viewpoint               Via Twitter  they also shared a second apology sent by Nvidia s Del Rizzo that said  to withhold samples because I didn t agree with your commentary is simply inexcusable and crossed the line                            

Improper disclosures about cryptomining edit 
In       Nvidia s chips became popular for cryptomining  the process of obtaining crypto rewards in exchange for verifying transactions on distributed ledgers  the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  said  However  the company failed to disclose that it was a  significant element  of its revenue growth from sales of chips designed for gaming  the SEC further added in a statement and charging order  Those omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia s business  the SEC emphasized  Nvidia  which did not admit or deny the findings  has agreed to pay      million to settle civil charges  according to a statement made by the SEC in May                   

French Competition Authority Investigation edit 
On September           Nvidia s French offices were searched by the French Competition Authority  The raid  authorized by a judge  was part of an investigation into suspected anti competitive practices in the graphics card sector  Nvidia has not publicly commented on the incident
