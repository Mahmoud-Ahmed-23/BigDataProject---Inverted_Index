							Egypt s Minister of Finance Ahmed Kouchouk and Minister of Environment Yasmine Fouad reaffirmed the government s commitment to expanding private sector investment in waste to energy projects  In a joint statement  they emphasized that these initiatives align with Egypt s broader economic vision  which seeks to enhance private sector participation in economic and developmental activities while attracting foreign direct investment particularly in the transition to a green economy 
Kouchouk highlighted Egypt s efforts to adopt competitive mechanisms to attract investment  including expanding the public private partnership  PPP  model and leveraging the Public Contracts Law  These measures support the government       s strategy to utilize waste as an alternative fuel for electricity generation  preserving natural gas for higher value industries 
He noted that the Ministries of Finance and Environment are working in close coordination to maximize the benefits of waste to energy projects by establishing clear priorities  defining implementation mechanisms  and securing necessary financial resources for their execution 
Minister of Environment Yasmine Fouad stressed the urgent need to adjust waste to energy tariffs to provide stronger incentives for private investors  She explained that by offering competitive rates  the government can encourage companies to expand operations and attract new players into the sector 
Fouad outlined three key sources of waste used for energy generation  organic waste  sludge  and landfill gases  She emphasized that waste to energy projects significantly reduce reliance on sanitary landfills  limiting the need for new landfill sites and preventing environmental hazards caused by waste accumulation 
The minister also noted that the government has allocated land for waste to energy projects across eight governorates  with implementation set to roll out over the next three to four years  As part of broader regulatory reforms  Egypt is raising tariff rates and offering additional incentives to private investors  reinforcing its commitment to international environmental goals  enhancing its nationally determined contributions  NDCs   and attracting foreign investment in waste collection  transportation  and recycling
