In probability theory  conditional independence describes situations wherein an observation is irrelevant or redundant when evaluating the certainty of a hypothesis  Conditional independence is usually formulated in terms of conditional probability  as a special case where the probability of the hypothesis given the uninformative observation is equal to the probability without  If 
  
    
      
        A

 is the hypothesis  and

 and

 are observations  conditional independence can be stated as an equality

The concept of conditional independence is essential to graph based theories of statistical inference  as it establishes a mathematical relation between a collection of conditional statements and a graphoid

Proximity and delays edit 
Let events A and B be defined as the probability that person A and person B will be home in time for dinner where both people are randomly sampled from the entire world  Events A and B can be assumed to be independent i e  knowledge that A is late has minimal to no change on the probability that B will be late  However  if a third event is introduced  person A and person B live in the same neighborhood  the two events are now considered not conditionally independent  Traffic conditions and weather related events that might delay person A  might delay person B as well  Given the third event and knowledge that person A was late  the probability that person B will be late does meaningfully change            

Dice rolling edit 
Conditional independence depends on the nature of the third event  If you roll two dice  one may assume that the two dice behave independently of each other  Looking at the results of one die will not tell you about the result of the second die   That is  the two dice are independent   If  however  the  st die s result is a    and someone tells you about a third event   that the sum of the two results is even   then this extra unit of information restricts the options for the  nd result to an odd number  In other words  two events can be independent  but NOT conditionally independent            

Height and vocabulary edit 
Height and vocabulary are dependent since very small people tend to be children  known for their more basic vocabularies  But knowing that two people are    years old  i e   conditional on age  there is no reason to think that one person s vocabulary is larger if we are told that they are taller

 and 
  
    
      
        Y

 are again independent  but this time they take the value   with probability        Then

 and 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
      displaystyle Y 
  
 are dependent  because Pr X                 lt  Pr X               Y                  This is because Pr X                            but if Y               then it s very likely that W               and thus that X               as well  so Pr X               Y                      gt

      displaystyle X perp        perp Y 
  
  each taking the values   and   with probability           Let 
  
    
      
        W
      
    
      displaystyle W 
  
 be the product 
  
    
      
        X
          x  c  
        Y
      
    
      displaystyle X cdot Y 
  
   Then when 
  
    
      
        W
         
         
      
    
      displaystyle W   
  
  Pr X                                 but Pr X               Y                                 so 
  
    
      
         
        X
          x  a

        W
      
    
      displaystyle  X perp        perp Y  mid W

Uses in Bayesian inference edit 
Let p be the proportion of voters who will vote  yes  in an upcoming referendum  In taking an opinion poll  one chooses n voters randomly from the population  For i                               n  let Xi               or   corresponding  respectively  to whether or not the ith chosen voter will or will not vote  yes  
In a frequentist approach to statistical inference one would not attribute any probability distribution to p  unless the probabilities could be somehow interpreted as relative frequencies of occurrence of some event or as proportions of some population  and one would say that X        Xn are independent random variables 
By contrast  in a Bayesian approach to statistical inference  one would assign a probability distribution to p regardless of the non existence of any such  frequency  interpretation  and one would construe the probabilities as degrees of belief that p is in any interval to which a probability is assigned  In that model  the random variables X                  Xn are not independent  but they are conditionally independent given the value of p  In particular  if a large number of the Xs are observed to be equal to    that would imply a high conditional probability  given that observation  that p is near    and thus a high conditional probability  given that observation  that the next X to be observed will be equal to   

Rules of conditional independence edit 
A set of rules governing statements of conditional independence have been derived from the basic definition                       
These rules were termed  Graphoid Axioms 
by Pearl and Paz             because they hold in graphs  where 
  
    
      
        X
          x  a  
        
        
        
          x  a  
        A
          x     
        B
      
    
      displaystyle X perp        perp A mid B 
  
 is interpreted to mean   All paths from X to A are intercepted by the set B

  it follows that

          x  a  
        Y
         
        W
        
           
        
        Z
      
    
      displaystyle P X Z W Y  P X Z  iff X perp        perp Y W Z 
  
 
Technical note  since these implications hold for any probability space  they will still hold if one considers a sub universe by conditioning everything on another variable  say      K  For example  
  
    
      
        X
          x  a  
        
        
        
          x  a  
        Y
          x  d  
        Y
          x  a  
        
        
        
          x  a  
        X
      
    
      displaystyle X perp        perp Y Rightarrow Y perp        perp X 
  
 would also mean that 
  
    
      
        X
          x  a  
        
        
        
          x  a  
        Y
          x     
        K
          x  d  
        Y
          x  a  
        
        
        
          x  a  
        X
          x     
        K
      
    
      displaystyle X perp        perp Y mid K Rightarrow Y perp        perp X mid K

  To see that this is the case  one needs to realise that Pr R   B   Y  is the probability of an overlap of R and B  the purple shaded area  in the Y area  Since  in the picture on the left  there are two squares where R and B overlap within the Y area  and the Y area has twelve squares  Pr R   B   Y                                            Similarly  Pr R   Y                                           and Pr B   Y
