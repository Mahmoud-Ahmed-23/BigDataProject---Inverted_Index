Dr Mahmoud Al Garf  president of the Industrial Development Authority  IDA  
Interview by Abdel Qader Ramadan
Egypt s Industrial Development Authority  IDA  has begun implementing a new strategy to develop and distribute land under its jurisdiction and facilitate investment in industry   This would be done by providing a new comprehensive roadmap for industrial development  working to strengthen the Land Facilitation Fund  and improving local industry 
Mahmoud Al Garf  president of the authority  said that the IDA is currently working to create a new comprehensive industrial roadmap and to identify opportunities for investment available throughout the country  He said that in order to succeed  it would be important to first determine what one s goals were in production  and identify the resources one has at their disposal  Otherwise achieving progress and development would be impossible 
This would first be done he said  by assessing the comparative advantages of various industrial pursuits  such as the mining of non metallic ore  determining their location throughout Egypt  analysing the logistics required in extracting resources and the potential such resources have to contribute to local production  in addition to assessing the amount of foreign and local demand existed for such products  This would all be done in order to help determine which factories throughout Egypt would be best used to mine for ore and other resources 
He said that this information was available  but unfortunately it is scattered throughout various government agencies  The IDA  Al Garf said  was working to gather all such data in one place  Upon doing so  the IDA would then be able to best determine which factories should be utilised based on their proximity to natural resources  ports  roads and water and energy reserves 
This new strategy he said would be the determining factor for identifying which sites to use for future industrial activities  in addition to the average lengths of new projects and the extent to which old factories could be renovated and revived for re use  The IDA would also work diligently to single out and determine which territories were not suitable for production and which factories were beyond repair and could therefore no longer be used 
The new roadmap would also help address any potential issues with infrastructure or logistical problems obstacles faced by businessmen and investors looking to do business in specific areas  In these cases  the IDA may request that the government construct new roads  ports and other facilities near targeted factories and regions in order to help jump start local industry and production 
He added that the IDA planned to bring in experts on mineral mining  logistical information and data analysis in order to help conduct their research regarding the potential for certain regions to yield results  According to Al Garf  completion of this new roadmap would be finished by June  and that the Suez Canal region would be one of the first areas to be targeted by its programs 
The roadmap would also further work to determine how each available square meter of land in Egypt could best be used and by which economic sector  whether industrial  farming  tourism  housing construction or others  After this  a second stage of usage designation would then take place  For example  if a particular plot of land is set aside for industrial use  depending on findings conducted by experts using the standards set forth by the IDA s new roadmap  this land would then further be designated as being set aside for chemical  engineering  or histological industrial use 
The IDA has also begun to develop a strategy regarding the industrial preparation and mechanization of land before it is distributed to investors  A majority of this land  Al Garf said  was located in three provinces currently under the jurisdiction of both the IDA and Urban Communities Authority  Until now  the IDA has been responsible for overseeing and distributing land to businesses and investors under the jurisdiction of both entities according to a previous legal protocol signed between the two 
Recently  according to Al Garf  seven billion square meters of land throughout Egypt under the supervision of the IDA has recently been identified as suitable for industrial use  most of which is located in remote regions far from any urban areas and devoid of any real infrastructure  He said that companies will be unable to actually see or view much of this land other than through Google maps  and they will be unable to reach it other than by helicopter 
For these reasons  the IDA has become dependent on the Urban Communities Authority to help install facilities and prepare the land for its first stage of development  in the hopes that this will help make the land more attractive to investors 
For these reasons  in addition to the existence of large amounts of minerals  mining ore and other energy resources on some parts of the land  many government officials have considered placing this land under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry 
After completion of the roadmap  members of the IDA will discuss with the National Centre for the Planning of State Land Use  NCPSLU  as to how best to distribute the land under the IDA s jurisdiction  Land under the IDA s jurisdiction not currently fit for development or industrial use could  with permission from the NCPSLU  be swapped and exchanged for suitable territory in other provinces 
Al Garf then discussed how the Land Facilitation Fund within the IDA  which was previously referred to as the Subsidized Land Facilitation Fund  LFF   had recently had the first word of its previous name dropped by the IDA s board of directors  who decided after engaging in consultations with government officials  that the LFF s funding would come exclusively from the sale of land under the IDA s jurisdiction  as opposed to sales in addition to public subsidies from the state budget 
The LFF had previously ceased to distribute land under its jurisdiction due to pressures applied to the public budget as a result of Egypt s political and financial crisis  However the IDA has stated that it will resume its activities now that it is not dependent on government finances for funding 
Al Garf went on to say that land under the jurisdiction of the IDA leased to private companies  would be done as part of a usufruct industrial development scheme  held through public private partnerships  PPP   This would be done so as not to put increased financial strain on state budgets 
Al Garaf did however express his opposition to the complete ownership of plots of industrial land by investors  The implementation of a usufruct development scheme would prevent this  as it was a system used all throughout the world that would help keep the land under the partial ownership of the state  allowing it to be used by future generations of Egyptians 
Egypt s Ministry of Finance suggested creating a sub branch within the IDA responsible for preparing the necessary documents needed for government agencies to enter into business partnership with the private sector  These would then be presented to the Ministry of Finance who would finalise the documents and present them to Egypt s Cabinet then formally enter into negotiations with investors 
Al Garaf added that industrial development in this day and age would require that government agencies cooperate with large companies in order to secure investment and required funding needed to build and construct roads  gas and electrical stations  water purification centres and other facilities in remote areas 
Companies  he said  would participate in auctions to buy the land  and upon doing so would then be able sell particular territories to investors along with necessary tools and facilities to begin production  Under such a scheme  companies would be required to pay a percentage of their yearly profits to the government during this time  and would also be responsible for overseeing maintenance and upkeep on all job sites 
The IDA president predicted that    million square meters of land in the province of Fayoum would be the first territory to be auctioned off and sold to companies looking to engage in production 
He added that once other lands under the jurisdiction of the IDA were developed and equipped with proper tools and facilities that it was only a matter of time before they too became increasingly desirable to businessmen and investors 
According to Al Garaf  money made from the sale of these territories to developers would then go into the coffers of the LFF within the IDA  These funds would then be used to help further prepare and equip those territories which had not yet sold and were not ready for purchase by companies or investors with the proper tools and facilities  Money might also be used to expand the IDA s search for suitable land into territories that had not yet been pursued 
The IDA  he added  would soon seek the aid of the Executive Body for Mineral and Industrial Plans within the Ministry of Industry to help play the primary role in preparing and equipping territory in remote areas in order to better help attract large scale development companies 
He went on to say that the ministry would then work to help pave roads and construct water and electrical stations in these remote territories 
Ideas were also being considered  he said  to create a jointly run company with the IDA  Arab contractors and Egypt s Armed Forces that would be responsible for overseeing projects located in the Sinai Peninsula  This would be done seeing as the latter is currently the primary party concerned with ongoing events in the area 
Because of these developments  in addition to the state of Egypt s current political and economic crisis that has persisted over the last two years  the IDA took it upon itself to sign a new protocol with the Urban Communities Authority  that would free it of the responsibility of having to distribute land under the jurisdiction of both authorities  as was stipulated in the previous protocol 
The process that the IDA would take when distributing these territories to government agencies and investors would begin with the announcement of available land open for development  Offers would then be collected and reviewed  followed by prices for land being set  However under the new protocol  the IDA would only have the authority to review offers made by companies  and determine the extent to which they met the standards and requirements for purchasing land in said areas  The IDA would then grant  No Objection Certificates  to qualifying companies  which would be presented to city authorities who would then determine the price of the land and allot it to companies  in a way that was consistent with and met the standards of the Urban Communities Authority 
Al Garaf added that despite this new system  there still did exist a serious desire on the part of Egypt s government to establish one authority responsible for overseeing all aspects of land distribution  Unfortunately the idea had still not been seriously addressed  and such a body was not yet in the process of being created  He went on to say that until this body was established  the IDA would continue to cooperate with the Urban Communities Authority 
He added that standards and protocols regarding the new roadmap and its land distribution program were nearly complete and that now it was only necessary to start making land available  To do this  he said  the IDA would soon begin auctioning off specified plots of land periodically to companies every two to three months 
He added that so far nearly       investors had made offers to the IDA for over      industrial projects located in    cities throughout Egypt 
He went on to say that the Urban Communities Authority was currently working to set prices for targeted land  which would most likely begin from between EGP     to EGP     per square meter 
The authority was also seeking to introduce laws and measures governing state policy in the case of more than one investor competing over one plot of land  This would begin by first determining whether or not either investor owned other factories in the surrounding area  If matters could not be resolved  the Authority would resort to holding a draft or lottery to choose between the competing investors 
Al Garaf stated that this new strategy would put an end to some of the destructive policies adopted by factory owners over the last two years since the outbreak of the revolution and onset of Egypt s political and economic crisis  These ranged from investors reneging on contracts  to companies and investors holding onto purchased territory without utilising production for the purpose of waiting until property prices rise  at which point they would sell the land  in addition to land owners simply raising prices artificially on buyers due to the scarcity of available land 
He went on to say that the IDA was attempting to free itself of the responsibility of having to distribute land under the jurisdiction of the Urban Communities Authority  focusing only on lands directly under its purview  Responsibility for this would gradually be transferred to various city authorities 
The IDA  according to Al Garaf  wanted to clarify that it would not serve as the police force of Egypt s industrial sector  and that it was not actively working against it  Rather  he said  it sought to play the role of lawyer who supported the industry s growth and sought to help pave the road ahead of it 
He went on to say that the IDA s goal was to help spur local industry and production  particularly food products  and what was required would be to build and construct new specialised industrial complexes  in addition to helping Egyptian factories better design their own industrial die 
The development of locally made industrial die would be critical to the expansion of local industry  seeing as most of the country s supply had been purchased from abroad at highly inflated prices  preventing Egyptian factories from modernising their facilities and products  For these reasons  Egyptian factories have been hard pressed to keep up with world developments in industry and production techniques 
He acknowledged that there existed industrial die production centres in Egypt but that they were few and far between  many of them did not meet the needs or standards of the industry  He called on the IDA to cooperate with both the public and private sectors  in addition to Egypt s armed forces  to unify their efforts to encourage the production of locally made industrial die
