Military edit 
The Royal Australian Air Force  RAAF  Air Operations Division  AOD  uses AI for expert systems  AIs operate as surrogate operators for combat and training simulators  mission management aids  support systems for tactical decision making  and post processing of the simulator data into symbolic summaries              
Aircraft simulators use AI for training aviators  Flight conditions can be simulated that allow pilots to make mistakes without risking themselves or expensive aircraft  Air combat can also be simulated 
AI can also be used to operate planes analogously to their control of ground vehicles  Autonomous drones can fly independently or in swarms              
AOD uses the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System  or IFDIS  which is a rule based expert system using information from TF    documents and expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF     This system was designed to be used for the development of the TF    for the F    C  The system replaced specialized workers  The system allowed regular workers to communicate with the system and avoid mistakes  miscalculations  or having to speak to one of the specialized workers 
Speech recognition allows traffic controllers to give verbal directions to drones 
Artificial intelligence supported design of aircraft               or AIDA  is used to help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft  This program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the design process  The software also allows the user to focus less on the software tools  The AIDA uses rule based systems to compute its data  This is a diagram of the arrangement of the AIDA modules  Although simple  the program is proving effective

Architecture edit 
This section is an excerpt from Artificial intelligence in architecture  edit 
AI Architecture utilizing sketch to image to  D model workflow
Artificial intelligence in architecture describes the use of artificial intelligence in automation  design and planning in the architectural process or in assisting human skills in the field of architecture               Artificial Intelligence is thought to potentially lead to and ensue major changes in architecture                                          

AI s potential in optimization of design  planning and productivity have been noted as accelerators in the field of architectural work  The ability of AI to potentially amplify an architect s design process has also been noted  Fears of the replacement of aspects or core processes of the architectural profession by Artificial Intelligence have also been raised  as well as the philosophical implications on the profession and creativity                                        AI in architecture has created a way for architects to create things beyond human understanding  AI implementation of machine learning text to render technologies  like DALL E and stable Diffusion  gives power to visualization complex              
AI allows designers to demonstrate their creativity and even invent new ideas while designing  In future  AI will not replace architects  instead  it will improve the speed of translating ideas sketching              

Ethical Considerations and Societal Impacts edit 
The use of AI raises some important ethical issues like privacy  bias  and accountability  When algorithms are trained on biased data  they can end up reinforcing existing inequalities  for example consider how facial recognition technology often performs poorly or fails in certain demographics               Plus  AI s use in surveillance makes people worry about their personal rights and data privacy  

Challenges and Future Directions edit 
The integrartion of these technologies raises some issues that we need to look at  First  it s important to make sure that the data we use is accurate and fair  We also need to address issues of bias to ensure that AI systems treat everyone equally  Creating rules and guidelines for how AI is used is another important step  Data privacy and ensuring security is very essential to maintain trust  While adaptation of these technolgies can give us more efficiency in the work pattern  there might be a challenge for human workforce      citation needed     
Looking ahead  we aim to develop AI that can explain its decisions clearly so that people can understand how it works  There s also a goal to create more advanced AI that can handle a wider range of problems  Researchers are starting to emphasize the importance of working together across different fields to develop better technologies for AI so that it provides fair benefits for everyone
