CAIRO  Egypt       s military leaders will hold a referendum on constitutional change on March     a parliamentary election in June and a presidential poll six weeks later  a youth activist said on Monday after meeting them 
Zyad El Elaily and    other members of the Coalition of Revolutionary Youth which took part in protests to oust President Hosni Mubarak  said he had met three members of the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces on Sunday 
       The armed forces council told us the referendum on constitutional amendments would take place on March    and the People       s Assembly election would be held in June         Elaily said         Presidential elections would be held a month and a half later        
The council has yet to set a formal date for the referendum or elections 
Elaily said the council       s timeframe for the referendum and the elections reflected its eagerness to hand over power 
       The council said it was committed to see a civilian government set up within the six month period and refused to consider extending the period         Elaily said 
Egypt       s new military rulers said on Feb     they would keep control of the country for six months or until parliamentary and presidential elections were held following constitutional amendments 
Voters can use their national identification cards to vote rather than obtaining a voting card   a procedure that opposition activists and voters said discouraged participation 
The elections will be supervised by the judiciary  which was largely excluded from the last election held under Mubarak that was widely seen as rigged
