Oliver Gordon Selfridge     May          December       was a mathematician and computer scientist who pioneered the early foundations of modern artificial intelligence             He is mostly known for his      paper  Pandemonium  A paradigm for learning describing what s now known as the Pandemonium Architecture  He has been called the  Father of Machine Perception             


Biography edit 
Selfridge  born in England  was a grandson of Harry Gordon Selfridge             the founder of Selfridges department stores  His father was Harry Gordon Selfridge Jr  and his mother was a clerk at Selfridge s store  His parents had met  fallen in love  married and had children all in secret  and Oliver never met his grandfather  Harry Sr  He was educated at Malvern College  and  upon moving to the US  at Middlesex School in Concord  Massachusetts  before earning an S B  from MIT in mathematics in        He then became a graduate student of Norbert Wiener at MIT  but did not write up his doctoral research and never earned a Ph D   
Marvin Minsky considered Selfridge to be one of his mentors             and Selfridge was one of the    attendees  with Minsky  of the Dartmouth workshop that is considered the founding event of artificial intelligence as a field  
Selfridge wrote important early papers on neural networks  pattern recognition  and machine learning  and his  Pandemonium  paper        is generally recognized as a classic in artificial intelligence  In it  Selfridge introduced the notion of  demons  that record events as they occur  recognize patterns in those events  and may trigger subsequent events according to patterns they recognize  Over time  this idea gave rise to aspect oriented programming 
In       in their formative paper  The Computer as a Communication Device   J  C  R  Licklider and Robert Taylor introduced a concept known as an OLIVER  On Line Interactive Vicarious Expediter and Responder   which was named in honor of Selfridge            
Selfridge spent his career at Lincoln Laboratory  MIT  where he was Associate Director of Project MAC   Bolt  Beranek and Newman  and GTE Laboratories where he became Chief Scientist  He served on the NSA Advisory Board for    years  chairing the Data Processing Panel  In      he was elected a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence             Selfridge retired in                 
In       Duncan Campbell identified Selfridge as his  best source  for Campbell s      reporting on US National Security Agency wiretapping activity at RAF Menwith Hill in England              Campbell described this operation in New Statesman as a  billion dollar phone tap             
Selfridge also authored four children s books  Sticks  Fingers Come In Fives  All About Mud  and Trouble With Dragons
