learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task  In simple words  ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data It can be broadly categorized into four types Types of Machine LearningSupervised Learning  Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new  unseen data Unsupervised Learning  Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data  like clustering or dimensionality reduction Reinforcement Learning  Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards  ideal for decision making tasks Note  Self supervised learning is not one of the original three  but it has become a major category in deep learning and fields like NLP and computer vision Semi Supervised Learning  The model generates its own labels from the data  so we don t need human annotated labels Module    Machine Learning PipelineIn order to make predictions there are some steps through which data passes in order to produce a machine learning model that can make predictions  ML workflowData CleaningFeature ScalingData Preprocessing in PythonModule    Supervised Learning Supervised learning nbsp algorithms are generally categorized into nbsp two main types  nbsp Classification   where the goal is to predict discrete labels or categories nbsp Regression   where the aim is to predict continuous numerical values  Supervised LearningThere are many algorithms used in supervised learning each suited to different types of problems  Some of the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms are    Linear RegressionThis is one of the simplest ways to predict numbers using a straight line  It helps find the relationship between input and output Introduction to Linear RegressionGradient Descent in Linear RegressionMultiple Linear RegressionRidge RegressionLasso regressionElastic net Regression   Logistic RegressionUsed when the output is a  yes or no  type answer  It helps in predicting categories like pass fail or spam not spam Understanding Logistic RegressionCost function in Logistic Regression   Decision TreesA model that makes decisions by asking a series of simple questions  like a flowchart  Easy to understand and use Decision Tree

tries to draw the best line  or boundary  to separate different categories of data Understanding SVMsSVM Hyperparameter Tuning   GridSearchCVNon Linear SVM   k Nearest Neighbors  k NN This model looks at the closest data points  neighbors  to make predictions  Super simple and based on similarity Introduction to KNNDecision Boundaries in K Nearest Neighbors  KNN    Na ve BayesA quick and smart way to classify things based on probability  It works well for text and spam detection Introduction to Naive BayesGaussian Naive BayesMultinomial Naive BayesBernoulli Naive BayesComplement Naive Bayes   Random Forest  Bagging Algorithm A powerful model that builds lots of decision trees and combines them for better accuracy and stability Introduction to Random forestRandom Forest ClassifierRandom Forest RegressionHyperparameter Tuning in Random ForestIntroduction to Ensemble LearningEnsemble learning combines multiple simple models to create a stronger  smarter model  There are mainly two types of ensemble learning Bagging that combines multiple models trained independently Boosting that builds models sequentially each correcting the errors of the previous one Module    Unsupervised learningUnsupervised learning are again divided into three main categories based on their purpose  nbsp Clustering nbsp Association Rule MiningDimensionality Reduction Unsupervised Learning   ClusteringClustering algorithms group data points into clusters based on their similarities or differences  Types of clustering algorithms are Centroid based Methods K Means clusteringElbow Method for
