							The year      may be remembered as the year when mainstream entertainment took a backseat  giving way to the invasion of alternative culture  Nearly every form of popular culture failed to attract the millions who turned up last year to watch the blockbuster movies  major theatrical productions and purchase the latest albums of the country       s biggest pop stars Instead  adolescents         still representing the largest  most active consumers of culture products         shifted their focus to independent films  small and experimental theater and stand up comedy Although poor comedies dominated the box office along with a fair number of no brainer action and na ve dramas  there was a silver lining  The year featured a surge of serious  well crafted productions that heaped millions of pounds in the box office in addition to the rare critical acclaim  The year       s top grossing films                Morgan Ahmed Morgan          Keda Reda          El Gezira  and even the patchy        Taymour  amp amp  Shafika          are top notch entertainment flicks  Despite their flaws  they did not succumb to the crassness embraced by other films The unexpected success of Mohamed Khan       s        In the Heliopolis Flat  proved that there is a large audience for mature  intelligent films  The turnout for both independent and international film festivals continued to rise this year and new audiences         old and young  foreign and Egyptian  intellectuals and regular film fans         joined the curious droves that came to check out the hype surrounding the new cultural products Popular music maintained its downward spiral into insignificance in a year that witnessed another new low for record sales  Apart from few hit records from established musicians like Amr Diab  Tamer Hosni and Mohamed Hamaki  no new artist succeeded in leaving a memorable impression this year  The number of released albums plunged dramatically from the past few years as the new        singles  format continued to dominate the ailing music market Besides the summer concerts that attract thousands of young music fans  the real music attraction this year was the large number of Egyptian independent bands populating cultural centers  music clubs  theaters and El Sawy Cultural Wheel         the hub of Cairo       s cultural activities Reputable indie musicians such as Wust El Balad  Eftikasat  Eskinderalla  Black Theama and several others managed to draw legions of old and new fans  A number of international musicians gave live performances in Cairo this year  Algerian singer songwriter Souad Massi gave one of the most successful concerts of the summer while the British Council       s music project Music Matbakh stunned the fans with the most innovative  energetic performance of the year The dance scene also took another step forward this year  The diverse performances staged this year introduced break dance and hip hop to the public with B D  Break to Dervish Madrid and The Flying Steps  The eighth International Festival for Dance Theater attracted a respectable number of fans for the several outstanding performances this year The slow evolution of theater developed in the margins  leaving private commercial and national theater in a state of uncertainty and irrelevance  Private theater is currently restricted to ancient plays by Adel Imam  Ahmed Adam and a new show by Samir Ghanem  National theater  on the other hand  boasted a considerable number of plays performed on their flourishing stages  Nearly all of the plays suffered from the persisting traditional ills of Egyptian theater as they struggled to present works of true merit Independent theater  on the other hand  continued to provoke and fascinate  Popular AUC productions  the Cairo International Festival for Experimental Theater and the other independent performances enriched the scene this year with exceptional performances including        Isis Habibty          Noises Off          Chocolat          Medea  and        Memory of Water   the best Egyptian play of the year The best new cultural hit of      is  without a doubt  stand up comedy  Sawy staged the first ever stand up comedy performance with the Azhar Osman       s show in August  A few months later  the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour took Egypt by storm         thousands of tickets were sold and shows were quickly sold out  Egyptian TV drama reclaimed its throne from Syrian drama as millions of television viewers were glued to their sets with a horde of serials fronted by the country       s biggest stars including Youssra  Yehia El Fakharany and Nour El Sherif  It was the Saudi produced series        King Farouk  that stole the limelight  almost rewriting recent history         King Farouk  was a true phenomenon  impelling nearly every single media outlet in the country to reopen the file of the most controversial figure in modern Egyptian history  Sales of books about Farouk and his era soared and a new generation developed a fixation for Egypt       s last monarch while millions of ruminated upon the glorious pre Nasser age  Numerous major cultural events hit the international scene this year  including the current writer       s strike in the US and British Rock outfit Radiohead       s history making decision to allow their fans to set their own price for the band       s latest LP Sadly       will forever be remembered as the year legendary filmmaker Ingmar Bergman and Michelangelo Antonioni passed away at the end of July  The death of both filmmakers  critics from every corner of the earth attested  marks the end of the greatest epoch of filmmaking  the real conclusion to the one most imperative cultural movements of the   th century
