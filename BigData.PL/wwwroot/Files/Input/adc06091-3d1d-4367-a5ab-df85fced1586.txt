Bill Gates and Paul Allen s Original Business Cards located in the Microsoft Visitor Center
Childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen sought to make a business using their skills in computer programming              In       they founded Traf O Data  which sold a rudimentary computer to track and analyze automobile traffic data  Gates enrolled at Harvard University while Allen pursued a degree in computer science at Washington State University  though he later dropped out to work at Honeywell             
The January      issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems s  MITS  Altair      microcomputer              which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device  Gates called MITS and claimed that he had a working interpreter  and MITS requested a demonstration  Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter  and it worked flawlessly when they demonstrated it to MITS in March      in Albuquerque  New Mexico  MITS agreed to distribute it  marketing it as Altair BASIC                                                   Gates and Allen established Microsoft on April          with Gates as CEO              and Allen suggested the name  Micro Soft   short for micro computer software                          In August       the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan  resulting in its first international office of ASCII Microsoft              Microsoft moved its headquarters to Bellevue  Washington  in January                  
Microsoft entered the operating system  OS  business in      with its own version of Unix called Xenix              but it was MS DOS that solidified the company s dominance  IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November      to provide a version of the CP M OS to be used in the IBM Personal Computer  IBM PC               For this deal  Microsoft purchased a CP M clone called    DOS from Seattle Computer Products which it branded as MS DOS  although IBM rebranded it to IBM PC DOS  Microsoft retained ownership of MS DOS following the release of the IBM PC in August       IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS  so other companies had to reverse engineer it for non IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles  but no such restriction applied to the operating systems  Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor                                                The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in       as well as with a publishing division named Microsoft Press                                   
Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in      after developing Hodgkin s lymphoma              Allen claimed in Idea Man  A Memoir by the co founder of Microsoft that Gates wanted to dilute his share in the company when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin s disease because he did not think that he was working hard enough              Allen later invested in low tech sectors  sports teams  commercial real estate  neuroscience  private space flight  and more

On July           the Department of Justice s Antitrust Division filed a competitive impact statement that said   Beginning in      and continuing until July           Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti competitive  per processor licenses  Under a per processor license  an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor  whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non Microsoft operating system  In effect  the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty  or tax  on the OEM s use of a competing PC operating system  Since       Microsoft s use of per processor licenses has increased
