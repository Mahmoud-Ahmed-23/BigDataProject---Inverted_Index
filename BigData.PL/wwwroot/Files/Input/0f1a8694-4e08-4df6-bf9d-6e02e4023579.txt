Temporary work or temporary employment  also called gigs  refers to an employment situation where the working arrangement is limited to a certain period of time based on the needs of the employing organization  Temporary employees are sometimes called  contractual    seasonal    interim    casual staff    outsourcing   and  freelance   or the words may be shortened to  temps   In some instances  temporary  highly skilled professionals  particularly in the white collar worker fields  such as human resources  research and development  engineering  and accounting  refer to themselves as consultants  Increasingly  executive level positions  e g   CEO  CIO  CFO  CMO  CSO  are also filled with interim executives or fractional executives      citation needed     
Temporary work is different from secondment  which involves temporarily assigning a member of one organization to another  In this case  the employee typically retains their salary and other employment rights from their primary organization  Still  they work closely with other organizations to provide training and share experiences 
Temporary workers may work full time or part time depending on the individual situation  In some instances  temporary workers receive benefits  such as health insurance   but usually benefits are only given to permanent employees as a cost cutting measure by the employer to save money  Not all temporary employees find jobs through a temporary employment agency  With the rise of the Internet and gig economy  a labor market characterized by the prevalence of short term contracts or freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs   many workers are now finding short term jobs through freelance marketplaces  a situation that brings into being a global market for work                       
A temporary work agency  temp agency or temporary staffing firm finds and retains workers  Other companies in need of short term workers contract with the temporary work agency to send temporary workers  or temps  on assignments to work at the other companies  Temporary employees are also used in cyclical work  requiring frequent staffing adjustments 


History edit 
Trends in temporary work  US   Source  D  H  Author  Outsourcing at Will  The Contribution of Dismissal Doctrine to the Growth of Employment Outsourcing The staffing industry in the United States began after World War II with small agencies in urban areas employing housewives for part time work as office workers  Over the years  the advantages of having workers who could be hired and laid off on short notice and were exempt from paperwork and regulatory requirements resulted in a gradual but substantial increase in temporary workers  with over     million employed in the United States by                 
There has been a paradigm shift since the     s in how firms utilize temporary workers  Throughout the Fordist era  temporary workers made up a rather marginal proportion of the total labor force in North America  Typically  temporary workers were white women in pink collar  clerical positions who provided companies with a stopgap solution for permanent workers who needed a leave of absence when on vacation or illness             In contrast  in the Post Fordist period  characterized by neoliberalism  deindustrialization and the dismantling of the welfare state  these understandings of temporary labor began to shift             In this paradigm  the idea of the temporary worker as a stopgap solution to permanent labor became an entirely normative employment alternative to permanent work            
Therefore  temporary workers no longer represented a substitute for permanent workers on leave but became semi permanent  precarious positions routinely subject to the threat of elimination because of company product fluctuations  In today s temporary labor force  both people and positions have become temporary  and temporary agencies use the temporary workers systematically and plan instead of impromptu            
Temporary employment has become more prevalent in America due to the rise of the Internet and the gig economy  The  gig economy  is defined as a labor market characterized by the prevalence of short term contracts or freelance work instead of permanent jobs             It is a common misconception that participation in the gig economy is a relatively new method of employment  However  finding work in the gig economy is similar to the employment style before the Industrial Revolution  It is the  one person  one career model  that society is accustomed to  and the gig economy is disrupting a relatively recent phenomenon             Before the Industrial Revolution in the   th century  it was common for one person to take on multiple temporary jobs to piece together livable earnings 

Post Fordism edit 
As the market began to transform from Fordism to a post order regime of capital accumulation  the social regulation of labor markets and the very nature of work began to shift             This transformation has been characterized by an economic restructuring that emphasized flexibility within spaces of work  labor markets  employment relationships  wages and benefits  Indeed  global processes of neoliberalism and market rule contributed greatly to this increasing pressure on local labor markets towards flexibility              This greater flexibility within labor markets is important at the global level  particularly within OECD countries and liberal market economies  see liberal market economy  
The temporary labor industry is worth over      billion per year  and the most prominent agencies are spread across over    nations  The biggest temporary work agencies are most profitable in emerging economies of the Global North and those that have undergone market liberalization  deregulation  and  re regulation             
Temporary work opportunities and restrictions vary around the world  Chile  Columbia  and Poland have the highest percentage of temporary dependent employment at               and        respectively  Romania  Lithuania  and Estonia have the lowest temporary dependent employment percentages  ranging from       The United Kingdom has    temporary employment  Germany has     temporary employment  and France has     temporary employment              In many countries  there are no restrictions on the type of temporary work that is legal  including the United Kingdom  Canada  China  Sweden  and Denmark  The United Kingdom has in place the Temporary Agency Work Directive       which ensures equal pay and treatment of temporary workers  Similarly  Brazil enforces full time employment regulations to part time employment and outsourcing  In some countries  including Brazil  there is a wage gap between temporary and permanent workers  but this is due to violations of legislation that specify equal wage determination              In other countries  prohibitions are placed on temporary employment in fields such as agriculture  construction  and non core employment              In Mexico  a temporary employee is   prohibited to perform the same work as regular employee               making temporary work illegal 
Gig economy based temporary work is prevalent around the world  Uber  for example  operates in North  Central  and South America  Europe  the Middle East  Africa  East  South  Southeast Asia  Australia  and New Zealand              Airbnb advertises listings in     countries around the world with the most in Europe             
The desire to market flexible  adaptable temporary workers has become the temporary work industry s driving  monetary oriented objective  This has caused individual agencies to adopt practices that focus on competition with other firms  that promote  try before you buy  practices  and that maximize their ability to produce a product  the temporary worker  Through this process  the ideal temporary worker has today become largely imagined  produced  and marketed by temporary agencies             

Agencies edit 
The role of a temp agency is as a third party between the client employer and the client employee  This third party handles remuneration  work scheduling  complaints  taxes  etc   created by the relationship between a client employer and a client employee  Client firms request the type of job that is to be done and the skills required to do it  Client firms can also terminate an assignment and file a complaint about the temp                          Work schedules are determined by assignment  which is determined by the agency and can last for an indeterminate period  extended to any point  and cut short              Because the assignments are temporary  there is little incentive to provide benefits  and the pay is low in situations with a lot of labor flexibility   Nurses are an exception to this since there is currently a shortage                                       Workers can refuse assignment but risk going through an indeterminate period of downtime since work is based on the availability of assignments  which the agency cannot  create   only fill             
Whether the work comes through an independent gig economy source or a temp agency  when a temporary employee             agrees to an assignment  they receive instructions pertaining to the job  The agency also provides information on correct work attire  work hours  wages  and whom to report to  If a temporary employee arrives at a job assignment and is asked to perform duties not described when they accepted the job  they may call an agency representative for clarification  If they choose not to continue on the assignment based on these discrepancies  they will most likely lose pay and may undermine chances at other job opportunities  However  some agencies guarantee an employee a certain number of hours of pay if there is no work once the temporary employee arrives or the work is not as described  Most agencies do not require an employee to continue work if the discrepancies make it difficult for the employee to do the work             
A temporary work agency may have a standard set of tests to judge the competence of the secretarial or clerical skills of an applicant  An applicant is hired based on their scores on these tests and is placed into a database  Companies or individuals looking to hire someone temporarily contact the agency and describe the skill set they are seeking  A temporary employee is then found in the database and is contacted to see if they would be interested in taking the assignment             
It is up to the temporary employee to keep in constant contact with the agency when not currently working on an assignment  by letting the agency know that they are available to work  they are given priority over those who may be in the agency database who have not made it clear that they are ready and willing to take an assignment  A temp agency employee is the exclusive employee of the agency  not of the company in which they are placed  although subject to legal dispute   The temporary employee is bound by the rules and regulations of the temp agency  even if they contrast with those of the company in which they are placed 

Benefits for client firms edit 
There are several reasons as to why a firm utilizes temp agencies  They provide employers a way to add more workers for a short term increase in the workforce  Using temps allows firms to replace a missing regular employee  A temp worker s competency and value can be determined without the inflexibility of hiring a new person and seeing how they work out  Utilizing temp workers can also be a way of not having to pay benefits and increasing the salaries of regular employees  A firm can also use temp workers to vary compensation in what would normally be an illegal or impossible manner  The role of temp workers in the work space can also have the effects of coercing regular employees into taking more work for less pay  Additionally  temp workers are less likely to sue over mistreatment  which allows firms to reduce the costs of employment in high stress  regulated jobs                                                 

Growth of temporary staffing edit 
Temp agencies are a growing part of industrial economies  From      to       the number of employees sent out by temporary staffing agencies increased by    percent  Temporary staffing industry payrolls increased by     percent from      to           percent from      to       and     percent from      to       The temporary staffing sector accounted for   out of    new jobs in the    s              In       there was      billion worldwide in staffing agency revenues  By            billion was generated worldwide in revenues for staffing agencies              The Temporary Staffing Industry accounts for     of job growth in the U S  since the great recession ended  even though it only accounts for    of all farm jobs             
This growth has occurred for several reasons  Demand for temporary employment can be primarily attributed to employers  demand  not employees                          A large driver of demand was in European labor market  Previously  temporary employment agencies were considered quasi legal entities  This reputation shied potential client employers away  However  in the latter half of the   th century  a shift would be predominated by legal protections and closer relationships with primary employers  This  combined with the tendency for growth of the TSI in countries where there are strict regulations on dismissal of hired employees but loose regulations on temporary work  means that growth is much faster compared to industrialized nations without these labor conditions                         

Abuse in the temporary staffing industry edit 
Staffing agencies are prone to improper behavior just like any other employer                          There have been cases of some temp agencies that have created and reinforced an ethnic hierarchy that determines who gets what jobs             
An additional ramification of temp workers  guest  status is at the bottom of the workplace hierarchy  which is visually identifiable on ID cards  in different colored uniforms  as well as the encouragement of more  provocative dress               Their  guest  status often means temp workers are unable to access on site workplace accommodations and are not included in meetings despite the length of their time working at the client firm                                     
This is all compounded by a working system in which temps must file complaints about clients through the temp agencies  which  often enough  disqualifies them not only from another assignment at that firm but also from receiving an assignment from that temporary agency upon review              Since a client firm is harder to replace than a client employee  and there is no disincentive to not give a complaining employee an assignment  there is an incentive for agencies to find employees who are willing to go along with the conditions of client firms  as opposed to severing ties with firms that routinely violate the law             

Occupational safety and health edit 
Temporary workers are at a high risk of being injured or killed on the job  In the U S       fatal injuries      of all occupational fatalities  occurred among contract workers in                   Studies have also shown a higher burden of nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses among temporary workers compared to those in standard employment arrangements                          There are many possible contributing factors to the high rates of injuries and illnesses among temporary workers  They are often inexperienced and assigned to hazardous jobs and tasks                                                  may be reluctant to object to unsafe working conditions or to advocate for safety measures due to fear of job loss or other repercussions              and they may lack basic knowledge and skills to protect themselves from workplace hazards due to insufficient safety training              According to a joint guidance document released by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA  and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH   both staffing agencies and host employers  i e   the clients of staffing agencies  are responsible for providing and maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for temporary workers              Collaborative and interdisciplinary  e g   epidemiology  occupational psychology  organizational science  economics  law  management  sociology  labor health and safety  research and intervention efforts are needed to protect and promote the occupational safety and health of temporary workers              In       NIOSH and partners released a set of occupational safety and health best practices for host employers of temporary workers              Checklists to foster adoption of the best practices and a slide deck staffing companies can use to educate their host employer clients about the best practices are also included 

Pros and cons edit 
Pros edit 
Easy hire  Those meeting technical requirements for the type of work are often virtually guaranteed a job without a selection process  In this sense  it could be argued that finding work as a temporary worker would be more accessible  Also  in some cases  agencies will hire temporary workers without submission of a r sum  or an interview            
Potential for flexible hours which can lead to happier employees            
There is an opportunity to gain experience companies are all unique  so the temporary worker will be exposed to a plethora of different situations and office procedures            
Some companies do not hire internally and use these staffing services only  They are an excellent gateway to get employment with a certain company 
Try before you buy  temporary staff allows a business to try a worker as part of its team and confirm that they are a good fit before taking them on board long term if needed 
Temporary work can be extremely lucrative for those in less wealthy countries             
Temporary work with internet of things based companies offer a source of supplemental income            
Temporary work may be a way in which someone who has retired can re enter the workforce             
Cons edit 
Workers  scholars  union organizers  and activists have identified many cons of temporary work  including the gig economy              These include 

Lack of control over working hours and the potential for immediate termination for refusing an assigned schedule 
Positions often are with high turnover rates  Research suggests that plants choose temporary workers over permanent ones when they expect output to fall  which allows them to avoid costs associated with laying off permanent employees            
Lack of reference  since many employers of experienced job positions do not consider work done for a temporary agency as sufficient on a r sum 
In the United States  the gradual replacement of workers by temporary workers resulted in millions of workers being employed in low paid temporary jobs            
In the U S   the hourly wage paid to a temporary worker is     to     of what direct hire employees are paid              Additionally  they often receive few or no employment benefits  such as health insurance  and seldom become full time employees from their temporary positions             
Unlike temporary workers hired through a staffing agency  many people in the gig economy do not report their income to the IRS  resulting in an estimated        billion in the United States alone of unreported income              This can result in fines or jail time 
In South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa  temporary workers often suffer from overworking             
The temporary workforce can become oversaturated  leading to other issues such as wage deflation                         
When a company hires internationally  there is no legal precedent for using the laws of the hiring company s country of origin or the temporary worker s country of origin             
Legal issues edit 
Scholars have argued that neoliberal policies have been prominent in erasing the standard employment relationship  This precarious new model of employment has greatly reduced the worker s ability to negotiate and  in particular  with the introduction of advanced technology  that can easily replace the worker   reduced the temp s bargaining power              Internet of Things based companies such as Uber and Handy have come into conflict with authorities and workers for circumventing labor and social security obligations                                      It has been suggested that labour regulations in North America do little in addressing labour market insecurities and the precarious nature of temporary labour  In many cases  legislation has done little to acknowledge or adapt to the growth of non standard employment in Canada             
California Assembly Bill   in      addressed the issue of contract workers  including those in the gig economy  and set stricter requirements that must be satisfied for a worker to be classified as a contractor and not an employee  as employees receive more worker protection and benefits than contractors  In       Kentucky  HB       Utah  Indiana  HB        Iowa  SF        and Tennessee  SB       passed laws specifying certain on demand gig economy workers as  marketplace contractors  and classifying them as independent contractors                         
In the European Union  temporary work is regulated by the Temporary Agency Work Directive and the Member States  laws implementing that directive             
Lawsuits have addressed some of the controversies about the status of temporary workers in the sharing economy  For example  two class action lawsuits settled in      resulted in changes to Uber s employment policies  including clarification of drivers  rights and the company s disciplinary procedures              Some of these policies include Uber agreeing to issue warnings to drivers before cutting them from the company s service  no longer deactivating drivers who commonly refuse rides  informing customers that tips for drivers are not included in the fare  and allowing drivers to create an association to contest terminations  However  the legal settlement did not establish whether these workers are employees or independent contractors
