							China has completed its first satellite laser ranging experiment at a distance comparable to that between the Earth and the Moon  according to CGTN  a partner of TV BRICShttps   tvbrics com en news china conducts first ever laser measurement of satellite at lunar distance  
The experiment targeted a satellite in a distant retrograde orbit  a stable orbital path sometimes referred to as a        natural space harbour         Using a ground based laser system with a     metre aperture  researchers precisely measured the distance to the satellite orbiting approximately         kilometres away  similar to the average Earth Moon separation 
The satellite involved in the measurement was launched earlier this year but initially failed to reach its intended orbit  Engineers successfully guided it into the correct position following a recovery effort that lasted several months 
This achievement also contributed to the development of a new navigation system designed to allow satellites to operate autonomously in the region between the Earth and the Moon  an area much larger than traditional near Earth satellite orbits 
The success demonstrates significant progress in space technology and supports ambitions for future missions to the Moon and beyond  the CGTN report stated
