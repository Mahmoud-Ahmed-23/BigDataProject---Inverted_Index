A military artificial intelligence arms race is an arms race between two or more states to develop and deploy lethal autonomous weapons systems  LAWS   Since the mid     s  many analysts have noted the emergence of such an arms race between superpowers for better military AI                        driven by increasing geopolitical and military tensions  
An AI arms race is sometimes placed in the context of an AI Cold War between the United States and China            


Terminology edit 
Lethal autonomous weapons systems use artificial intelligence to identify and kill human targets without human intervention             LAWS have colloquially been called  slaughterbots  or  killer robots   Broadly  any competition for superior AI is sometimes framed as an  arms race                         Advantages in military AI overlap with advantages in other sectors  as countries pursue both economic and military advantages

In       AI specialist Steve Omohundro warned that  An autonomous weapons arms race is already taking place              According to Siemens  worldwide military spending on robotics was US     billion in      and US     billion in                              
China became a top player in artificial intelligence research in the     s  According to the Financial Times  in       for the first time  China published more AI research papers than the entire European Union  When restricted to number of AI papers in the top    of cited papers  China overtook the United States in      but lagged behind the European Union                  of the researchers presenting at the      American Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence  AAAI  conference were Chinese             Eric Schmidt  the former chairman of Alphabet  has predicted China will be the leading country in AI by                  

Risks edit 
One risk concerns the AI race itself  whether or not the race is won by any one group  There are strong incentives for development teams to cut corners with regard to the safety of the system  increasing the risk of critical failures and unintended consequences                          This is in part due to the perceived advantage of being the first to develop advanced AI technology  One team appearing to be on the brink of a breakthrough can encourage other teams to take shortcuts  ignore precautions and deploy a system that is less ready  Some argue that using  race  terminology at all in this context can exacerbate this effect             
Another potential danger of an AI arms race is the possibility of losing control of the AI systems  the risk is compounded in the case of a race to artificial general intelligence  which may present an existential risk              In       a United States Air Force official reportedly said that during a computer test  a simulated AI drone killed the human character operating it  The USAF later said the official had misspoken and that it never conducted such simulations             
A third risk of an AI arms race is whether or not the race is actually won by one group  The concern is regarding the consolidation of power and technological advantage in the hands of one group              A US government report argued that  AI enabled capabilities could be used to threaten  critical infrastructure  amplify disinformation campaigns  and wage war                 and that  global stability and nuclear deterrence could be undermined

United States edit 
The Sea Hunter  an autonomous US warship      
In       former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel posited the  Third Offset Strategy  that rapid advances in artificial intelligence will define the next generation of warfare              According to data science and analytics firm Govini  the U S  Department of Defense  DoD  increased investment in artificial intelligence  big data and cloud computing from      billion in      to      billion in                   However  the civilian NSF budget for AI saw no increase in                   Japan Times reported in      that the United States private investment is around     billion per year              The November       Interim Report  of the United States  National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence confirmed that AI is critical to US technological military superiority             
The U S  has many military AI combat programs  such as the Sea Hunter autonomous warship  which is designed to operate for extended periods at sea without a single crew member  and to even guide itself in and out of port              From       a temporary US Department of Defense directive requires a human operator to be kept in the loop when it comes to the taking of human life by autonomous weapons systems              On October           the United States Department of Defense s Defense Innovation Board published the draft of a report recommending principles for the ethical use of artificial intelligence by the Department of Defense that would ensure a human operator would always be able to look into the  black box  and understand the kill chain process  However  a major concern is how the report will be implemented             
The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center  JAIC   pronounced  jake               is an American organization on exploring the usage of AI  particularly edge computing   Network of Networks  and AI enhanced communication  for use in actual combat                                                  It is a subdivision of the United States Armed Forces and was created in June       The organization s stated objective is to  transform the US Department of Defense by accelerating the delivery and adoption of AI to achieve mission impact at scale  The goal is to use AI to solve large and complex problem sets that span multiple combat systems  then  ensure the combat Systems and Components have real time access to ever improving libraries of data sets and tools              
In      Microsoft pitched the DoD to use DALL E models to train its battlefield management system              OpenAI  the developer of DALL E  removed the blanket ban on military and warfare use from its usage policies in January                  

Project Maven edit 
Main article  Project Maven
Project Maven is a Pentagon project involving using machine learning and engineering talent to distinguish people and objects in drone videos              apparently giving the government real time battlefield command and control  and the ability to track  tag and spy on targets without human involvement  Initially the effort was led by Robert O  Work who was concerned about China s military use of the emerging technology               Reportedly  Pentagon development stops short of acting as an AI weapons system capable of firing on self designated targets              The project was established in a memo by the U S  Deputy Secretary of Defense on    April                   Also known as the Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team              it is  according to Lt  Gen  of the United States Air Force Jack Shanahan in November       a project  designed to be that pilot project  that pathfinder  that spark that kindles the flame front of artificial intelligence across the rest of the  Defense  Department               Its chief  U S  Marine Corps Col  Drew Cukor  said   People and computers will work symbiotically to increase the ability of weapon systems to detect objects               Project Maven has been noted by allies  such as Australia s Ian Langford  for the ability to identify adversaries by harvesting data from sensors on UAVs and satellite              At the second Defense One Tech Summit in July       Cukor also said that the investment in a  deliberate workflow process  was funded by the Department  of Defense  through its  rapid acquisition authorities  for about  the next    months              

Project Artemis edit 
The U S  Department of Defense is partnering with Ukraine on  Project Artemis  to develop advanced drones that can withstand electronic warfare  blending Ukrainian simplicity and adaptability with American precision  Due to the Russia Ukraine war  Ukraine has emerged as a leader in drone production and warfare  creating cost effective systems that challenge traditional approaches  Countries like Turkey  China  and Iran are also producing affordable drones  reducing America s monopoly and reshaping warfare dynamics  U S  efforts are focused on integrating AI  drone swarm technology  and hybrid drone systems to maintain military dominance  The democratization of drone technology raises issues  such as autonomous decision making  counter drone defenses  and dual use concerns  that challenge ethical and security norms             

China edit 
Further information  Artificial intelligence industry in China
China is pursuing a strategic policy of military civil fusion on AI for global technological supremacy                          According to a February      report by Gregory C  Allen of the Center for a New American Security  China s leadership   including paramount leader Xi Jinping   believes that being at the forefront in AI technology is critical to the future of global military and economic power competition             Chinese military officials have said that their goal is to incorporate commercial AI technology to  narrow the gap between the Chinese military and global advanced powers              The close ties between Silicon Valley and China  and the open nature of the American research community  has made the West s most advanced AI technology easily available to China  in addition  Chinese industry has numerous home grown AI accomplishments of its own  such as Baidu passing a notable Chinese language speech recognition capability benchmark in                   As of       Beijing s roadmap aims to create a      billion AI industry by                   Before       Chinese defense procurement was mainly restricted to a few conglomerates  however  as of       China often sources sensitive emerging technology such as drones and artificial intelligence from private start up companies              An October      report by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology found that  Most of the  Chinese military  s AI equipment suppliers are not state owned defense enterprises  but private Chinese tech companies founded after                    The report estimated that Chinese military spending on AI exceeded      billion each year              The Japan Times reported in      that annual private Chinese investment in AI is under    billion per year  AI startups in China received nearly half of total global investment in AI startups in       the Chinese filed for nearly five times as many AI patents as did Americans             
China published a position paper in      questioning the adequacy of existing international law to address the eventuality of fully autonomous weapons  becoming the first permanent member of the U  N  Security Council to broach the issue              In       Xi called for greater international cooperation in basic AI research              Chinese officials have expressed concern that AI such as drones could lead to accidental war  especially in the absence of international norms              In       former United States Secretary of Defense Mark Esper lashed out at China for selling drones capable of taking life with no human oversight             
The focus on  intelligentized AI warfare   pursued by China  suggests a comprehensive integration of AI across all domains  land  sea  air  space  and cyber  for autonomous attack  defence and cognitive warfare              The intelligentized strategy is distinct from traditional warfare  which focuses on network centric operations  and instead sees AI as a force multiplier that enhances decision making  command structures  and autonomous capabilities  Unlike traditional warfare  intelligentization leverages AI to create a cognitive advantage allowing it to process battlefield information better  AI assisted command and control  C   systems  predictive analytics  and real time data fusion  enabling accelerated human AI hybrid decision making 
Autonomous systems  including drone swarms  AI powered cyber warfare  play a crucial role in this strategy 
China is reported to be currently developing wingman drones  robotic ground forces  and optimised logistics to enhance combat effectiveness              The Chinese army  PLA   also emphasises cognitive warfare using AI driven psychological operations  social media manipulation  and predictive behavioural analysis to influence adversaries and the importance of dynamic responses where AI enhances hacking capabilities  automated SIGINT  Signals Intelligence  and adaptive tactics  However  despite this focus  some analysts believe China could be struggling to fully realise AI capability within the military environment  a  comprehensive review of dozens of Chinese language journal articles about AI and warfare reveals that Chinese defense experts claim that Beijing is facing several technological challenges that may hinder its ability to capitalize on the advantages provided by military AI

A task force for the Strategic Implementation of AI for National Security and Defence was established in February      by the Ministry of Defense s Department of Defence Production              The process of getting the military ready for AI use was started by the MoD in                   The Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics was approved to develop AI solutions to improve intelligence collection and analysis capabilities              In       the Indian Army  with assistance from the National Security Council  began operating the Quantum Lab and Artificial Intelligence Center at the Military College of Telecommunication Engineering  With an emphasis on robotics and artificial intelligence  Defence Research and Development Organisation and Indian Institute of Science established the Joint Advanced Technology Programme Center of Excellence                          In       the Indian Navy created an AI Core group and set up a Center of Excellence for AI and Big Data analysis at INS Valsura                          Indian Army incubated Artificial Intelligence Offensive Drone Operations Project                          During Exercise Dakshin Shakti       the Indian Army integrated AI into its intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance architecture             
In       the Indian government established the Defence Artificial Intelligence Council and the Defence AI Project Agency                          and it also published a list of    defense related AI priority projects                          MoD earmarked        crore annually till      for capacity building  infrastructure setup  data preparation  and Al project implementation              The Indian Army  the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force set aside      crore annually for the development of AI specific applications              The military is already deploying some AI enabled projects and equipment                          At Air Force Station Rajokri  the IAF Centre of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence was established in      as part of the Unit for Digitization  Automation  Artificial Intelligence  and Application Networking  UDAAN               Swarm drone systems were introduced by the Mechanised Infantry Regiment for offensive operations close to the Line of Actual Control             
For offensive operations  the military began acquiring AI enabled UAVs and swarm drones                                      Bharat Electronics developed AI enabled audio transcription and analysis software for batlefield communication  Using AI during transport operations  the Indian Army s Research  amp  Development branch patented driver tiredness monitoring system                          As part of initial investment  the Indian Armed Forces is investing about     million        million  yearly on AI  according to Delhi Policy Group              For high altitude logistics at forward outposts  military robots are deployed                          Army is developing autonomous combat vehicles  robotic surveillance platforms  and Manned Unmanned Teaming  MUM T  solutions as part of the Defence AI roadmap              MCTE is working with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and  Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering  amp  Research  on AI and military grade chipset                          Phase III of AI enabled space based surveillance has been authorized                         
DRDO Chairman and Secretary of the Department of Defense Research  amp  Development Samir V  Kamat said the agency started concentrating on the potential use of AI in the development of military systems and subsystems              The Indian government intends to leverage the private sector s sizable AI workforce and dual use technologies for defense by                   In order to conduct research on autonomous platforms  improved surveillance  predictive maintenance  and intelligent decision support system  the Indian Army AI Incubation Center was established              Indian Navy launched INS Surat with AI capabilities                         

Russia edit 
Putin  seated  center  at National Knowledge Day      
Russian General Viktor Bondarev  commander in chief of the Russian air force  stated that as early as February       Russia was working on AI guided missiles that could decide to switch targets mid flight              The Military Industrial Commission of Russia has approved plans to derive    percent of Russia s combat power from remote controlled and AI enabled robotic platforms by                   Reports by state sponsored Russian media on potential military uses of AI increased in mid                   In May       the CEO of Russia s Kronstadt Group  a defense contractor  stated that  there already exist completely autonomous AI operation systems that provide the means for UAV clusters  when they fulfill missions autonomously  sharing tasks between them  and interact   and that it is inevitable that  swarms of drones  will one day fly over combat zones              Russia has been testing several autonomous and semi autonomous combat systems  such as Kalashnikov s  neural net  combat module  with a machine gun  a camera  and an AI that its makers claim can make its own targeting judgements without human intervention             
In September       during a National Knowledge Day address to over a million students in        Russian schools  Russian President Vladimir Putin stated  Artificial intelligence is the future  not only for Russia but for all humankind    Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world   Putin also said it would be better to prevent any single actor achieving a monopoly  but that if Russia became the leader in AI  they would share their  technology with the rest of the world  like we are doing now with atomic and nuclear technology                                      
Russia is establishing a number of organizations devoted to the development of military AI  In March       the Russian government released a    point AI agenda  which calls for the establishment of an AI and Big Data consortium  a Fund for Analytical Algorithms and Programs  a state backed AI training and education program  a dedicated AI lab  and a National Center for Artificial Intelligence  among other initiatives              In addition  Russia recently created a defense research organization  roughly equivalent to DARPA  dedicated to autonomy and robotics called the Foundation for Advanced Studies  and initiated an annual conference on  Robotization of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation                           
The Russian military has been researching a number of AI applications  with a heavy emphasis on semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles  In an official statement on November          Viktor Bondarev  chairman of the Federation Council s Defense and Security Committee  stated that  artificial intelligence will be able to replace a soldier on the battlefield and a pilot in an aircraft cockpit  and later noted that  the day is nearing when vehicles will get artificial intelligence                Bondarev made these remarks in close proximity to the successful test of Nerehta  an crewless Russian ground vehicle that reportedly  outperformed existing  crewed  combat vehicles   Russia plans to use Nerehta as a research and development platform for AI and may one day deploy the system in combat  intelligence gathering  or logistics roles               Russia has also reportedly built a combat module for crewless ground vehicles that is capable of autonomous target identification and  potentially  target engagement and plans to develop a suite of AI enabled autonomous systems                                        
In addition  the Russian military plans to incorporate AI into crewless aerial  naval  and undersea vehicles and is currently developing swarming capabilities              It is also exploring innovative uses of AI for remote sensing and electronic warfare  including adaptive frequency hopping  waveforms  and countermeasures                            Russia has also made extensive use of AI technologies for domestic propaganda and surveillance  as well as for information operations directed against the United States and U S  allies                                        
The Russian government has strongly rejected any ban on lethal autonomous weapon systems  suggesting that such an international ban could be ignored                           
The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing Russia Ukraine war has seen seen significant use of AI by both sides and has also been characterised as a drone war              
Advances in AI powered GPS denied navigation and drone swarming techniques are significantly improving operational capabilities for Ukraine  Fully realised drone swarms  where multiple drones coordinate and make decisions autonomously  are still in the early stages of experimentation but Ukraine is exploring and implementing these techniques in a real conflict situation               The Defense Intelligence of Ukraine  DIU  has been at the forefront of utilizing drones with some elements of autonomy for conducting long range strikes into Russian territory  Domestic drone production has significantly expanded  with approximately   million drones produced in             of which were domestically manufactured              
Rather than replacing human involvement  AI is primarily serving to augment existing capabilities  enhancing the speed  accuracy  and overall efficiency of numerous military functions 
Perhaps the most important way in which AI has been used by Ukraine is in intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance  ISR  capabilities  The Ukrainian military uses Palantir s MetaConstellation software to monitor the movement of Russian troops and supplies  highlighting the blurring of boundaries between state military and commercial AI use   It aggregates data from various commercial civilian providers of satellite imagery Ukraine also uses its own Delta system which aggregates real time data from drone imagery  satellite photos  acoustic signals  and text to construct an operational picture for military commanders  AI is used to prioritise incoming threats  potential targets and resource constraints               
AI is also being used to process intercepted communications from Russian soldiers  to process  select  and output militarily useful information from these intercepted calls

Israel makes extensive use of AI for military applications specially during the Gaza war  The main AI systems used for target identification are the Gospel and Lavender  Lavender developed by the Unit      identifies and creates a database of individuals mostly low ranking militants of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and has a     accuracy rate and a database of tens of thousands   The Gospel in comparisons recommended buildings and structures rather than individuals  The acceptable collateral damage and the type of weapon used to eliminate the target is decided by IDF members and could track militants even when at home               
Israel s Harpy anti radar  fire and forget  drone is designed to be launched by ground troops  and autonomously fly over an area to find and destroy radar that fits pre determined criteria               The application of artificial intelligence is also expected to be advanced in crewless ground systems and robotic vehicles such as the Guardium MK III and later versions               These robotic vehicles are used in border defense 

United Kingdom edit 
In       the UK government opposed a ban on lethal autonomous weapons  stating that  international humanitarian law already provides sufficient regulation for this area   but that all weapons employed by UK armed forces would be  under human oversight and control               

South Korea edit 
The South Korean Super aEgis II machine gun  unveiled in       sees use both in South Korea and in the Middle East  It can identify  track  and destroy a moving target at a range of        km  While the technology can theoretically operate without human intervention  in practice safeguards are installed to require manual input  A South Korean manufacturer states   Our weapons don t sleep  like humans must  They can see in the dark  like humans can t  Our technology therefore plugs the gaps in human capability   and they want to  get to a place where our software can discern whether a target is friend  foe  civilian or military               

European Union edit 
The European Parliament holds the position that humans must have oversight and decision making power over lethal autonomous weapons               However  it is up to each member state of the European Union to determine their stance on the use of autonomous weapons and the mixed stances of the member states is perhaps the greatest hindrance to the European Union s ability to develop autonomous weapons  Some members such as France  Germany  Italy  and Sweden are developing lethal autonomous weapons  Some members remain undecided about the use of autonomous military weapons and Austria has even called to ban the use of such weapons              
Some EU member states have developed and are developing automated weapons  Germany has developed an active protection system  the Active Defense System  that can respond to a threat with complete autonomy in less than a millisecond                            Italy plans to incorporate autonomous weapons systems into its future military plans              

Proposals for international regulation edit 
The international regulation of autonomous weapons is an emerging issue for international law               AI arms control will likely require the institutionalization of new international norms embodied in effective technical specifications combined with active monitoring and informal diplomacy by communities of experts  together with a legal and political verification process                        As early as       scholars such as AI professor Noel Sharkey have warned of  an emerging arms race among the hi tech nations to develop autonomous submarines  fighter jets  battleships and tanks that can find their own targets and apply violent force without the involvement of meaningful human decisions                            
Miles Brundage of the University of Oxford has argued an AI arms race might be somewhat mitigated through diplomacy   We saw in the various historical arms races that collaboration and dialog can pay dividends                Over a hundred experts signed an open letter in      calling on the UN to address the issue of lethal autonomous weapons                            however  at a November      session of the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons  CCW   diplomats could not agree even on how to define such weapons               The Indian ambassador and chair of the CCW stated that agreement on rules remained a distant prospect               As of          heads of state and    Nobel Peace Prize laureates have backed a ban on autonomous weapons               However  as of       most major powers continue to oppose a ban on autonomous weapons              
Many experts believe attempts to completely ban killer robots are likely to fail               in part because detecting treaty violations would be extremely difficult                            A      report from Harvard s Belfer Center predicts that AI has the potential to be as transformative as nuclear weapons                                         The report further argues that  Preventing expanded military use of AI is likely impossible  and that  the more modest goal of safe and effective technology management must be pursued   such as banning the attaching of an AI dead man s switch to a nuclear arsenal              

Other reactions to autonomous weapons edit 
A      open letter by the Future of Life Institute calling for the prohibition of lethal autonomous weapons systems has been signed by over        citizens  including physicist Stephen Hawking  Tesla magnate Elon Musk  Apple s Steve Wozniak and Twitter co founder Jack Dorsey  and over       artificial intelligence researchers  including Stuart Russell  Bart Selman and Francesca Rossi                            The Future of Life Institute has also released two fictional films  Slaughterbots        and Slaughterbots   if human  kill           which portray threats of autonomous weapons and promote a ban  both of which went viral 
Professor Noel Sharkey of the University of Sheffield argues that autonomous weapons will inevitably fall into the hands of terrorist groups such as the Islamic State              

Disassociation edit 
Many Western tech companies avoid being associated too closely with the U S  military  for fear of losing access to China s market              Furthermore  some researchers  such as DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis  are ideologically opposed to contributing to military work              
For example  in June       company sources at Google said that top executive Diane Greene told staff that the company would not follow up Project Maven after the current contract expired in March
