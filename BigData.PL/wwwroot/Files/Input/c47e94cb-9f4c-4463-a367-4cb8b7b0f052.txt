Intelligence amplification  IA   also referred to as cognitive augmentation  machine augmented intelligence and enhanced intelligence  is the  use of information technology in augmenting human intelligence  The idea was first proposed in the     s and     s by cybernetics and early computer pioneers 
IA is sometimes contrasted with AI  artificial intelligence   that is  the project of building a human like intelligence in the form of an autonomous technological system such as a computer or robot  AI has encountered many fundamental obstacles  practical as well as theoretical  which for IA seem moot  as it needs technology merely as an extra support for an autonomous intelligence that has already proven to function  Moreover  IA has a long history of success  since all forms of information technology  from the abacus to writing to the Internet  have been developed basically to extend the information processing capabilities of the human mind  see extended mind and distributed cognition  


Major contributions edit 
William Ross Ashby  Intelligence Amplification edit 
The term intelligence amplification  IA  has enjoyed a wide currency since William Ross Ashby wrote of  amplifying intelligence  in his Introduction to Cybernetics         Related ideas were explicitly proposed as an alternative to Artificial Intelligence by Hao Wang from the early days of automatic theorem provers 

          problem solving  is largely  perhaps entirely  a matter of appropriate selection  Take  for instance  any popular book of problems and puzzles  Almost every one can be reduced to the form  out of a certain set  indicate one element           It is  in fact  difficult to think of a problem  either playful or serious  that does not ultimately require an appropriate selection as necessary and sufficient for its solution 
It is also clear that many of the tests used for measuring  intelligence  are scored essentially according to the candidate s power of appropriate selection           Thus it is not impossible that what is commonly referred to as  intellectual power  may be equivalent to  power of appropriate selection   Indeed  if a talking Black Box were to show high power of appropriate selection in such matters so that  when given difficult problems it persistently gave correct answers we could hardly deny that it was showing the  behavioral  equivalent of  high intelligence  

If this is so  and as we know that power of selection can be amplified  it seems to follow that intellectual power  like physical power  can be amplified  Let no one say that it cannot be done  for the gene patterns do it every time they form a brain that grows up to be something better than the gene pattern could have specified in detail  What is new is that we can now do it synthetically  consciously  deliberately         W  Ross Ashby  An Introduction to Cybernetics  Chapman and Hall  London  UK        Reprinted  Methuen and Company  London  UK       
J  C  R  Licklider  Man Computer Symbiosis edit 
 Man Computer Symbiosis  is a key speculative paper published in      by psychologist computer scientist J C R  Licklider  which envisions that mutually interdependent   living together   tightly coupled human brains and computing machines would prove to complement each other s strengths to a high degree 

Man computer symbiosis is a subclass of man machine systems  There are many man machine systems  At present  however  there are no man computer symbioses  The purposes of this paper are to present the concept and  hopefully  to foster the development of man computer symbiosis by analyzing some problems of interaction between men and computing machines  calling attention to applicable principles of man machine engineering  and pointing out a few questions to which research answers are needed  The hope is that  in not too many years  human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly  and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information handling machines we know today         J       C       R  Licklider   Man Computer Symbiosis   IRE Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics  vol  HFE          March      
In Licklider s vision  many of the pure artificial intelligence systems envisioned at the time by over optimistic researchers would prove unnecessary   This paper is also seen by some historians as marking the genesis of ideas about computer networks which later blossomed into the Internet  

Douglas Engelbart  Augmenting Human Intellect edit 
Licklider s research was similar in spirit to his DARPA contemporary and prot g  Douglas Engelbart  Both men s work helped expand the utility of computers beyond mere computational machines by conceiving and demonstrating them as a primary interface for humans to process and manipulate information            
Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information  and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new  improved technologies  He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer based technologies for manipulating information directly  and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge work  Engelbart s philosophy and research agenda is most clearly and directly expressed in the      research report  Augmenting Human Intellect  A Conceptual Framework            The concept of network augmented intelligence is attributed to Engelbart based on this pioneering work 

Increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation  to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs  and to derive solutions to problems 
Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following  more rapid comprehension  better comprehension  the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex  speedier solutions  better solutions  and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insolvable  And by complex situations we include the professional problems of diplomats  executives  social scientists  life scientists  physical scientists  attorneys  designers  whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years 

We do not speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular situations  We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches  cut and try  intangibles  and the human feel for a situation usefully co exist with powerful concepts  streamlined terminology and notation  sophisticated methods  and high powered electronic aids         Douglas Engelbart  Augmenting Human Intellect  A Conceptual Framework  Summary Report AFOSR       Stanford Research Institute  Menlo Park  CA  October                 
In the same research report he addresses the term  Intelligence Amplification  as coined by Ashby  and reflects on how his proposed research relates              
Engelbart subsequently implemented these concepts in his Augmented Human Intellect Research Center at SRI International  developing essentially an intelligence amplifying system of tools  NLS  and co evolving organizational methods  in full operational use by the mid     s within the lab  As intended             his R amp D team experienced increasing degrees of intelligence amplification  as both rigorous users and rapid prototype developers of the system  For a sampling of research results  see their      Mother of All Demos 

Later contributions edit 
Howard Rheingold worked at Xerox PARC in the     s and was introduced to both Bob Taylor and Douglas Engelbart  Rheingold wrote about  mind amplifiers  in his      book  Tools for Thought            
Andrews Samraj mentioned in  Skin Close Computing and Wearable Technology        about Human augmentation by two varieties of cyborgs  namely  Hard cyborgs and Soft cyborgs  A humanoid walking machine is an example of the soft cyborg and a pace maker is an example for augmenting human as a hard cyborg 
Arnav Kapur working at MIT wrote about human AI coalescence  how AI can be integrated into human condition as part of  human self   as a tertiary layer to the human brain to augment human cognition             He demonstrates this using a peripheral nerve computer interface  AlterEgo  which enables a human user to silently and internally converse with a personal AI                       
In      the technology of Artificial Swarm Intelligence was developed to amplify the intelligence of networked human groups using AI algorithms modeled on biological swarms  The technology enables small teams to make predictions  estimations and medical diagnoses at accuracy levels that significantly exceed natural human intelligence                                                
Shan Carter and Michael Nielsen introduce the concept of artificial intelligence augmentation  AIA   the use of AI systems to help develop new methods for intelligence augmentation  They contrast cognitive outsourcing  AI as an oracle  able to solve some large class of problems with better than human performance  with cognitive transformation  changing the operations and representations we use to think               A calculator is an example of the former  a spreadsheet of the latter 
Ron Fulbright describes human cognitive augmentation in human cog ensembles involving humans working in collaborative partnership with cognitive systems  called cogs   By working together  human cog ensembles achieve results superior to those obtained by the humans working alone or the cognitive systems working alone  The human component of the ensemble is therefore cognitively augmented  The degree of augmentation depends on the proportion of the total amount of cognition done by the human and that done by the cog  Six Levels of Cognitive Augmentation have been identified

Augmented intelligence has been a repeating theme in science fiction  A positive view of brain implants used to communicate with a computer as a form of augmented intelligence is seen in Algis Budrys      novel Michaelmas  Fear that the technology will be misused by the government and military is an early theme  In the      BBC serial The Nightmare Man the pilot of a high tech mini submarine is linked to his craft via a brain implant but becomes a savage killer after ripping out the implant 
Perhaps the most well known writer exploring themes of intelligence augmentation is William Gibson  in work such as his      story  Johnny Mnemonic   in which the title character has computer augmented memory  and his      novel Neuromancer  in which computer hackers interface through brain computer interfaces to computer systems  Vernor Vinge  as discussed earlier  looked at intelligence augmentation as a possible route to the technological singularity  a theme which also appears in his fiction 
Flowers for Algernon is an early example of augmented intelligence in science fiction literature              First published as a short story in       the plot concerns an intellectually disabled man who undergoes an experiment to increase his intelligence to genius levels  His rise and fall is detailed in his journal entries  which become more sophisticated as his intelligence increases
