							TRIPOLI  NATO warplanes battered Moamer Qaddafi       s command network in Tripoli  the alliance said Monday ahead of a visit to Libya by an envoy from Russia  which has raised concerns about the military campaign 
Five powerful blasts rocked Tripoli late Sunday after three waves of explosions during the day  as warplanes overflew the city which has been the target of intense NATO raids for the past two weeks 
In a statement  the military alliance said it conducted  quot intensive and sustained strikes against pro Qaddafi facilities in Tripoli throughout the day and night  quot  including command and control centers 
 quot We will continue to erode  the Qaddafi regime       s  foundations until the violence against the Libyan population ends  quot  it quoted Lieutenant General Charles Bouchard  commander in chief of the NATO mission  as saying 
NATO also reported strikes against three military vehicles in the vicinity of the strategic oil town of Brega and an armored vehicle near rebel held Misrata  Libya       s third city 
The latest salvos came as Russian mediator Mikhail Margelov prepared to head to the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi after Moscow voiced concerns about the NATO operation sliding towards a land campaign 
Margelov  President Dmitry Medvedev       s Africa envoy  told Russia       s RIA Novosti news agency he would meet rebel leaders including Mustafa Abdul Jalil  head of the National Transitional Council that controls eastern Libya around Benghazi 
His spokesman in Moscow said he would arrive in Benghazi on Tuesday morning and that the trip would exclude a visit to the Libyan capital 
Medvedev announced at the G  summit last month that he would be sending the envoy to Libya  as Moscow seeks to present itself as a potential mediator and expresses growing alarm over the continued conflict 
 quot A drawing out of the armed conflict will worsen the humanitarian situation not only in Libya but also in neighboring states that are taking on Libyan refugees  quot  Margelov told RIA 
 quot This all threatens a dangerous destabilization of the situation in the region  quot  he said 
Moscow has expressed alarm as NATO       s air campaign to enforce a UN mandated no fly zone to protect civilians entered a new phase with the deployment of British and French attack helicopters over the weekend 
 quot  NATO is  using attack helicopters on land targets  which is in my view the last but one step before the land operation  quot  said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov on Sunday 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague on Sunday defended the use of the helicopters and ruled out putting forces on the ground  saying NATO would stick to the terms of UN Resolution      passed in March to protect civilians 
 quot This is not mission creep  changing the nature of the mission  this is intensifying what we are doing in order to make this mission a success  quot  he said after stressing that no deadlines would be set on the mission 
The rebel leader Jalil had praised the deployment of attack helicopters  saying   quot We welcome any action that could precipitate the end of  Moammer  Qaddafi       s regime  quot 
Britain said on Sunday its Apache helicopters unleashed  quot Hellfire missiles quot  to destroy a multiple rocket launcher operated by Qaddafi forces near the eastern oil hub of Brega 
British Tornado strike warplanes separately joined other NATO aircraft in a  quot major strike on a large surface to air missile depot quot  in Tripoli  Major General Nick Pope  spokesman for the Chief of Defense Staff  said in a statement 
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said meanwhile that it was only a matter of time before Qaddafi       s aides abandoned him 
 quot It       s only a matter of time  before he falls   quot  Gates said   quot I don       t think anyone knows how long  But I think you see signs the regime is getting shakier by the day 
 quot It       s just a question when everybody around Qaddafi decides it       s time to throw in the towel and throw him under the bus  quot  he said on a visit to Afghanistan 
Elsewhere  Switzerland       s justice ministry said Monday it approved legal action to prosecute the Libyan regime for holding Swiss citizens Rachid Hamdani and Max Goeldi hostage 
 quot The Federal Council authorizes the opening of a penal procedure against the Libyan regime        over hostage taking and extortion and blackmail in the case of the two Swiss citizens Rachid Hamdani and Max Goeldi  quot  the ministry said in a statement 
The two men were blocked from leaving Libya in a tit for tat action after the brief arrest in Switzerland of one of Qaddafi       s sons in July      over mistreatment allegations by domestic staff
