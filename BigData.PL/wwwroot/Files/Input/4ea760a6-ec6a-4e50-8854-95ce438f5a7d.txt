AlphaFold is an artificial intelligence  AI  program developed by DeepMind  a subsidiary of Alphabet  which performs predictions of protein structure             It is designed using deep learning techniques            
AlphaFold          placed first in the overall rankings of the   th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction  CASP  in December       It was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structures for targets rated as most difficult by the competition organizers  where no existing template structures were available from proteins with partially similar sequences 
AlphaFold          repeated this placement in the CASP   competition in November                  It achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other entry                        It scored above    on CASP s global distance test  GDT  for approximately two thirds of the proteins  a test measuring the similarity between a computationally predicted structure and the experimentally determined structure  where     represents a complete match                        The inclusion of metagenomic data has improved the quality of the prediction of  MSAs  One of the biggest sources of the training data was the custom built Big Fantastic Database  BFD  of            protein families  represented as MSAs and hidden Markov models  HMMs   covering               protein sequences from reference databases  metagenomes  and metatranscriptomes            
AlphaFold   s results at CASP   were described as  astounding             and  transformational              However  some researchers noted that the accuracy was insufficient for a third of its predictions  and that it did not reveal the underlying mechanism or rules of protein folding for the protein folding problem  which remains unsolved                        
Despite this  the technical achievement was widely recognized  On    July       the AlphaFold   paper was published in Nature as an advance access publication alongside open source software and a searchable database of species proteomes                                     As of February       the paper had been cited nearly        times             
AlphaFold   was announced on   May       It can predict the structure of complexes created by proteins with DNA  RNA  various ligands  and ions                          The new prediction method shows a minimum     improvement in accuracy for protein interactions with other molecules compared to existing methods  Moreover  for certain key categories of interactions  the prediction accuracy has effectively doubled             
Demis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google DeepMind shared one half of the      Nobel Prize in Chemistry  awarded  for protein structure prediction   while the other half went to David Baker  for computational protein design               Hassabis and Jumper had previously won the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in      for their leadership of the AlphaFold project

Amino acid chains  known as polypeptides  fold to form a protein 
Proteins consist of chains of amino acids which spontaneously fold to form the three dimensional    D  structures of the proteins  The   D structure is crucial to understanding the biological function of the protein 
Protein structures can be determined experimentally through techniques such as X ray crystallography  cryo electron microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance  which are all expensive and time consuming              Such efforts  using the experimental methods  have identified the structures of about         proteins over the last    years  while there are over     million known proteins across all life forms            
Over the years  researchers have applied numerous computational methods to predict the  D structures of proteins from their amino acid sequences  accuracy of such methods in best possible scenario is close to experimental techniques  NMR  by the use of homology modeling based on molecular evolution  CASP  which was launched in      to challenge the scientific community to produce their best protein structure predictions  found that GDT scores of only about    out of     can be achieved for the most difficult proteins by                  AlphaFold started competing in the      CASP using an artificial intelligence  AI  deep learning technique             

Algorithm edit 
DeepMind is known to have trained the program on over         proteins from the Protein Data Bank  a public repository of protein sequences and structures  The program uses a form of attention network  a deep learning technique that focuses on having the AI identify parts of a larger problem  then piece it together to obtain the overall solution             The overall training was conducted on processing power between     and     GPUs            

AlphaFold          edit 

AlphaFold          was built on work developed by various teams in the     s  work that looked at the large databanks of related DNA sequences now available from many different organisms  most without known  D structures   to try to find changes at different residues  peptides  that appeared to be correlated  even though the residues were not consecutive in the main chain  Such correlations suggest that the residues may be close to each other physically  even though not close in the sequence  allowing a contact map to be estimated  Building on recent work prior to       AlphaFold   extended this by estimating a probability distribution for the distances between residues  effectively transforming the contact map into a distance map  It also used more advanced learning methods than previously to develop the inference

Architectural details of AlphaFold              
The      version of the program  AlphaFold          is significantly different from the original version that won CASP    in       according to the team at DeepMind                         
AlphaFold   used a number of separately trained modules to produce a guide potential  which was then combined with a physics based energy potential  AlphaFold   replaced this with a system of interconnected sub networks  forming a single  differentiable  end to end model based on pattern recognition  This model was trained in an integrated manner                          After the neural network s prediction converges  a final refinement step applies local physical constraints using energy minimization based on the AMBER force field  This step only slightly adjusts the predicted structure             
A key part of the      system are two modules  believed to be based on a transformer design  which are used to progressively refine a vector of information for each relationship  or  edge  in graph theory terminology  between an amino acid residue of the protein and another amino acid residue  these relationships are represented by the array shown in green   and between each amino acid position and each different sequences in the input sequence alignment  these relationships are represented by the array shown in red               Internally these refinement transformations contain layers that have the effect of bringing relevant data together and filtering out irrelevant data  the  attention mechanism   for these relationships  in a context dependent way  learnt from training data  These transformations are iterated  the updated information output by one step becoming the input of the next  with the sharpened residue residue information feeding into the update of the residue sequence information  and then the improved residue sequence information feeding into the update of the residue residue information              As the iteration progresses  according to one report  the  attention algorithm     mimics the way a person might assemble a jigsaw puzzle  first connecting pieces in small clumps in this case clusters of amino acids and then searching for ways to join the clumps in a larger whole                  needs update     
The output of these iterations then informs the final structure prediction module              which also uses transformers              and is itself then iterated  In an example presented by DeepMind  the structure prediction module achieved a correct topology for the target protein on its first iteration  scored as having a GDT TS of     but with a large number       of stereochemical violations   i e  unphysical bond angles or lengths  With subsequent iterations the number of stereochemical violations fell  By the third iteration the GDT TS of the prediction was approaching     and by the eighth iteration the number of stereochemical violations was approaching zero             
The training data was originally restricted to single peptide chains  However  the October      update  named AlphaFold Multimer  included protein complexes in its training data  DeepMind stated this update succeeded about     of the time at accurately predicting protein protein interactions             

AlphaFold          edit 

Announced on   May       AlphaFold   was co developed by Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs  both subsidiaries of Alphabet  AlphaFold   is not limited to single chain proteins  as it can also predict the structures of protein complexes with DNA  RNA  post translational modifications and selected ligands and ions                         
AlphaFold   introduces the  Pairformer   a deep learning architecture inspired by the transformer  which is considered similar to  but simpler than  the Evoformer used in AlphaFold                            The Pairformer module s initial predictions are refined by a diffusion model  This model begins with a cloud of atoms and iteratively refines their positions  guided by the Pairformer s output  to generate a  D representation of the molecular structure             
The AlphaFold server was created to provide free access to AlphaFold   for non commercial research              As of May       the AlphaFold   research paper has been directly cited more than      times             

Competitions edit 
Results achieved for protein prediction by the best reconstructions in the CASP      competition  small circles  and CASP      competition  large circles   compared with results achieved in previous years The crimson trend line shows how a handful of models including AlphaFold   achieved a significant step change in      over the rate of progress that had previously been achieved  particularly in respect of the protein sequences considered the most difficult to predict   Qualitative improvement had been made in earlier years  but it is only as changes bring structures within     of their experimental positions that they start to affect the CASP GDS TS measure   The orange trend line shows that by      online prediction servers had been able to learn from and match this performance  while the best other groups  green curve  had on average been able to make some improvements on it  However  the black trend curve shows the degree to which AlphaFold   had surpassed this again in       across the board  The detailed spread of data points indicates the degree of consistency or variation achieved by AlphaFold  Outliers represent the handful of sequences for which it did not make such a successful prediction 
CASP   edit 
In December       DeepMind s AlphaFold placed first in the overall rankings of the   th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction  CASP                          
The program was particularly successfully predicting the most accurate structure for targets rated as the most difficult by the competition organisers  where no existing template structures were available from proteins with a partially similar sequence  AlphaFold gave the best prediction for    out of    protein targets in this class                                      achieving a median score of      on the CASP s global distance test  GDT  score  ahead of      and      by the two next best placed teams              who were also using deep learning to estimate contact distances                          Overall  across all targets  AlphaFold   achieved a GDT score of                  
In January       implementations and illustrative code of AlphaFold   was released open source on GitHub                          but  as stated in the  Read Me  file on that website   This code can t be used to predict structure of an arbitrary protein sequence  It can be used to predict structure only on the CASP   dataset  links below   The feature generation code is tightly coupled to our internal infrastructure as well as external tools  hence we are unable to open source it   Therefore  in essence  the code deposited is not suitable for general use but only for the CASP   proteins  The company has not announced plans to make their code publicly available as of   March      

CASP   edit 
In November       DeepMind s new version  AlphaFold    won CASP                            Overall  AlphaFold   made the best prediction for    out of the    targets            
On the competition s preferred global distance test  GDT  measure of accuracy  the program achieved a median score of       out of       meaning that more than half of its predictions were scored at better than       for having their atoms in more or less the right place                          a level of accuracy reported to be comparable to experimental techniques like X ray crystallography                                     In      AlphaFold   had only reached this level of accuracy in two of all of its predictions                 of predictions in the      competition had a GDT TS score of more than     On the group of targets classed as the most difficult  AlphaFold   achieved a median score of    
Measured by the root mean square deviation  RMS D  of the placement of the alpha carbon atoms of the protein backbone chain  which tends to be dominated by the performance of the worst fitted outliers      of AlphaFold   s predictions had an RMS deviation of less than     for the set of overlapped C alpha atoms                 of predictions achieved better than      and     had a C alpha atom RMS accuracy better than                 with a median RMS deviation in its predictions of       for a set of overlapped CA atoms             AlphaFold   also achieved an accuracy in modelling surface side chains described as  really really extraordinary  
To further validate AlphaFold    the conference organizers approached four leading experimental groups working on structures they found particularly challenging and had been unable to determine  In all four cases the three dimensional models produced by AlphaFold   were sufficiently accurate to determine structures of these proteins by molecular replacement  These included target T      Af       a small membrane protein studied by experimentalists for ten years            
Of the three structures that AlphaFold   had the least success in predicting  two had been obtained by protein NMR methods  which define protein structure directly in aqueous solution  whereas AlphaFold was mostly trained on protein structures in crystals  The third exists in nature as a multidomain complex consisting of    identical copies of the same domain  a situation AlphaFold was not programmed to consider  For all targets with a single domain  excluding only one very large protein and the two structures determined by NMR  AlphaFold   achieved a GDT TS score of over    

CASP   edit 
In       DeepMind did not enter CASP    but most of the entrants used AlphaFold or tools incorporating AlphaFold             

Reception edit 
AlphaFold   scoring more than    in CASP s global distance test  GDT  is considered a significant achievement in computational biology            and great progress towards a decades old grand challenge of biology             Nobel Prize winner and structural biologist Venki Ramakrishnan called the result  a stunning advance on the protein folding problem              adding that  It has occurred decades before many people in the field would have predicted  It will be exciting to see the many ways in which it will fundamentally change biological research              
Propelled by press releases from CASP and DeepMind                          AlphaFold   s success received wide media attention              As well as news pieces in the specialist science press  such as Nature             Science             MIT Technology Review             and New Scientist                          the story was widely covered by major national newspapers                                                  A frequent theme was that ability to predict protein structures accurately based on the constituent amino acid sequence is expected to have a wide variety of benefits in the life sciences space including accelerating advanced drug discovery and enabling better understanding of diseases                         Some have noted that even a perfect answer to the protein prediction problem would still leave questions about the protein folding problem understanding in detail how the folding process actually occurs in nature  and how sometimes they can also misfold              
In       Demis Hassabis and John Jumper won the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences             as well as the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for their management of the AlphaFold project              Hassabis and Jumper proceeded to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in      for their work on  protein structure prediction  with David Baker of the University of Washington                         

Source code edit 
Open access to source code of several AlphaFold versions  excluding AlphaFold    has been provided by DeepMind after requests from the scientific community                                      The source code of AlphaFold               was made available for non commercial use to the scientific community upon request in November

The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database  a joint project between AlphaFold and EMBL EBI  was launched on July           At launch  the database contained AlphaFold predicted models for nearly the complete UniProt proteome of humans and    model organisms  totaling over         proteins  The database does not include proteins with fewer than    or more than      amino acid residues              but for humans they are available in the whole batch file              AlphaFold s initial goal  as of early       was to expand the database to cover most of the UniRef   set  which contains over     million proteins  As of May           the database contained         predictions             
In July       UniProt KB and InterPro             has been updated to show AlphaFold predictions when available             
On July           the team uploaded to the database the structures of around     million proteins from   million species  covering nearly every known protein on the planet             

Limitations edit 
AlphaFold has various limitations 

AlphaFold DB provides models of individual protein chains  monomers   rather than their biologically relevant complexes             
Many protein regions are predicted with low confidence score  including the intrinsically disordered protein regions             
Alphafold   was validated for predicting structural effects of mutations with a limited success             
The model relies  to some extent  on co evolutionary information from similar proteins  Therefore  it may not perform as well on synthetic proteins or proteins with very low homology to those in the training database             
The model s ability to predict multiple native conformations of proteins is limited 
AlphaFold   version can predict structures of protein complexes with a very limited set of selected cofactors and co  and post translational modifications              Between     and     of the structures of the human proteome are incomplete without covalently attached glycans                          AlphaFill  a derived database  adds cofactors to AlphaFold models where appropriate             
In the algorithm  the residues are moved freely  without any restraints  Therefore  during modeling the integrity of the chain is not maintained  As a result  AlphaFold may produce topologically wrong results  like structures with an arbitrary number of knots             
Applications edit

AlphaFold has been used to predict structures of proteins of SARS CoV    the causative agent of COVID     The structures of these proteins were pending experimental detection in early                              Results were reviewed by scientists at the Francis Crick Institute in the United Kingdom before being released to the broader research community  The team also confirmed accurate prediction against the experimentally determined SARS CoV   spike protein that was shared in the Protein Data Bank  an international open access database  before releasing the computationally determined structures of the under studied protein molecules              The team acknowledged that although these protein structures might not be the subject of ongoing therapeutical research efforts  they will add to the community s understanding of the SARS CoV   virus              Specifically  AlphaFold   s prediction of the structure of the ORF a protein was very similar to the structure determined by researchers at University of California  Berkeley using cryo electron microscopy  This specific protein is believed to assist the virus in breaking out of the host cell once it replicates  This protein is also believed to play a role in triggering the inflammatory response to the infection

  For the GDT TS measure used  each atom in the prediction scores a quarter of a point if it is within                     nm  of the experimental position  half a point if it is within      three quarters of a point if it is within      and a whole point if it is within     

  To achieve a GDT TS score of       mathematically at least     of the structure must be accurate to within      and at least     must be accurate to within
