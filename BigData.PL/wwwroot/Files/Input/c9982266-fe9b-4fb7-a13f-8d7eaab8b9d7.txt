Early life and career edit 
Azerbaijan edit 
Zadeh was born in Baku  Azerbaijan SSR              as Lotfi Aliasgerzadeh              His father was Rahim Aleskerzade  an Iranian Muslim Azerbaijani             journalist from Ardabil on assignment from Iran  and his mother was Fanya  Feyga              Korenman  a Jewish pediatrician from Odesa  Ukraine  who was an Iranian citizen                                                  The Soviet government at this time courted foreign correspondents  and the family lived well while in Baku              Zadeh attended elementary school for three years there              which he said  had a significant and long lasting influence on my thinking and my way of looking at things              

Iran edit 
In       when Stalin began agricultural collectivization              and Zadeh was ten  his father moved his family back to Tehran  Iran  Zadeh was enrolled in Alborz High School  a missionary school              where he was educated for the next eight years  and where he met his future wife              Fay  Faina              Zadeh  who said that he was  deeply influenced  by the  extremely decent  fine  honest and helpful  Presbyterian missionaries from the United States who ran the college   To me they represented the best that you could find in the United States   people from the Midwest with strong roots  They were really  Good Samaritans    willing to give of themselves for the benefit of others  So this kind of attitude influenced me deeply  It also instilled in me a deep desire to live in the United States               During this time  Zadeh was awarded several patents             
Zadeh sat for the Iran national university exams and placed third in the nation              As a student  he ranked first in his class in his first two years  In       he graduated from the University of Tehran with a degree in electrical engineering  one of only three students in that field to graduate that year  due to the turmoil created by World War II  when the United States  Britain and the Soviet Union invaded Iran  Over        American soldiers were based there  and Zadeh worked with his father  who did business with them as a contractor for hardware and building materials             

United States edit 
In       Zadeh decided to leave for the United States to continue his education              He travelled to Philadelphia by way of Cairo after months of delay waiting first for the proper papers and later for the right ship to appear      citation needed      He arrived in mid       lived in New York and worked for an electronic association              and entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT  as a graduate student in September that year                          While in the United States  he shortened his family name  creating a new middle name from the part he removed  and was thenceforth known as Lotfi Aliasker Zadeh              He received an MS degree in electrical engineering from MIT in      
In       as his parents had settled in New York City  Zadeh went to work as an engineer at Columbia University              Zadeh then applied to Columbia University                          Columbia admitted him as a doctoral student and offered him an instructorship as well              He received his PhD in electrical engineering from Columbia in      and became an assistant professor the next year                          Zadeh taught for ten years at Columbia and was promoted to full professor in      
The chairman of the electronic engineering department at the University of California  wrote and offered him work              In       Zadeh joined the Electrical Engineering faculty at the University of California  Berkeley  During his lengthy research career  Zadeh made important scientific contributions in two distinct areas      linear system theory and classical control systems  and     fuzzy sets  fuzzy logic  and related science and technology 
Zadeh was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in      for Natural Sciences in Applied Mathematics             
Zadeh s first important research contribution  well known among scholars of his generation in the electrical engineering community  was in the area of classical control systems  His pioneer work  co authored with Charles Desoer  Linear System Theory  The State Space Approach  laid a critical foundation for all modern approaches to system analysis and control              The second and more well known contribution of Zadeh s research is his lifelong dedication to the creation  enhancement and the real world impacts of a broad collection of science and technology based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic  He published his seminal work on fuzzy sets in       in which he described the motivation of replicating human like reasoning and detailed the mathematics of fuzzy set theory 
In      he proposed his theory of fuzzy logic  Together  fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic provide the necessary foundations for a broad class of related innovations  including  but not limited to  

fuzzy control   a practical approach to non linear control using fuzzy if then rules in fuzzy logic
fuzzy pattern recognition   a generalization of conventional pattern recognition techniques using fuzzy sets  e g   fuzzy k means generalizes k means clustering 
fuzzy database   generalizes classical database query language using fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic
fuzzy mathematics   generalizes conventional mathematics using fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic
neuro fuzzy systems   a synergistic combination of fuzzy logic and neural networks  providing the first interpretable AI system based on neural network learning
He was also on the Board of Governors for International Neural Network Society  INNS  in      

Impacts to higher education edit 
Zadeh became the Chair of Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of California  Berkeley  in       One of the lasting impacts of his leadership in this role is the expansion and the integration of computer science  He initiated and completed  in       the transformation of the Electrical Engineering department at UC Berkeley to the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  EECS   This strategic move not only led UC Berkeley s advancement into the top ranks of computer science education and research  but also led other research universities globally to add computer science to their electrical engineering departments 
In       Zadeh received the prestigious  Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers  IEEE Education Award  largely in recognition of his performance as chair of EE and then EECS  Other important services to UC Berkeley include his Academic Senate committee memberships  Academic Planning  amp  Resource Allocation            Committees                     Courses of Instruction            and Faculty Awards            Professor Zadeh graduated more than    PhD students  many of whom went on to become leaders in various areas of engineering  management and information sciences             

Personal life and beliefs edit

Zadeh photographed people around him             
 Zadeh was called  quick to shrug off nationalism  insisting there are much deeper issues in life   and was quoted as saying in an interview   The question really isn t whether I m American  Russian  Iranian  Azerbaijani  or anything else  I ve been shaped by all these people and cultures  and I feel quite comfortable among all of them               He noted in the same interview   Obstinacy and tenacity  not being afraid to get embroiled in controversy   that s very much a Turkish tradition  That s part of my character  too  I can be very stubborn  That has probably been beneficial for the development of fuzzy logic               He described himself as  an American  mathematically oriented  electrical engineer of Iranian descent  born in Russia              
He and his wife Fay Zadeh had two children  Stella and Norman Zada  His wife wrote a book  My Life and Travels with the Father of Fuzzy Logic             about their travels and experiences together  visiting  exotic places  and meeting interesting people around the world 
Zadeh died in his home in Berkeley  California             on   September       at the age of                               unreliable source       He was buried at the First Alley of Honors  on    September                  in Baku  Azerbaijan  the city in which he was born             His funeral was well attended by  highly respected people               A month prior to his death  the University of Tehran had released an erroneous report that Zadeh had died  but withdrew it several days later             

Work edit

According to Google Scholar  as of November       Zadeh s work has been cited at least         times in scholarly works              with the      Fuzzy sets paper receiving at least         citations             

Fuzzy sets and systems edit 
Zadeh  in his theory of fuzzy sets  proposed using a membership function  with a range covering the interval        operating on the domain of all possible values  He proposed new operations for the calculus of logic and showed that fuzzy logic was a generalisation of classical and Boolean logic  He also proposed fuzzy numbers as a special case of fuzzy sets  as well as the corresponding rules for consistent mathematical operations  fuzzy arithmetic              

Fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence edit 
Zadeh s research career has had a lasting impact on artificial intelligence  AI   Fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic are both motivated by our understanding of human cognition  that we are comfortable with concepts that have vague boundaries  This is well aligned with the Physical symbol system assumption in AI  by Allen Newell and Herbert A  Simon   inspired by another aspect of human cognition  that humans are comfortable with concepts that are described by symbols 
The concept of a linguistic variable in fuzzy logic connects a symbol that is typically a predicate in classical logic  e g    John is Bold   or in predicate logic   Bold John     to linguistic values  e g    John is somewhat bold   or in fuzzy logic   Bold John  Somewhat     which generalizes the binary value of predicate logic in two ways 
First  the two possible values  True or False  in predicate logic are generalized to a continuum  typically from    which corresponds to False  to    which corresponds to True   This allows the expression of Bold John        which indicates that John is midway between being devoid of boldness and being entirely bold 
The second generalization enabled by fuzzy logic is to use a fuzzy set such as  somewhat bold  to describe a person s boldness level in a way that is more natural to human understanding and communication  Without this generalization  we can only describe the value of a person s boldness as a number  e g        or as an interval  e g                  With this generalization  one can express the semantic meaning of  somewhat bold  as a fuzzy set in the domain of   and   
Zadeh was also an active contributor to the AI community  including at the Dartmouth Workshop that coined the term  artificial intelligence   He was subsequently a frequent contributor to leading AI conferences such as AAAI and IJCAI  as well as other top venues such as AI Magazine 

Other contributions edit 
Zadeh is credited  along with John R  Ragazzini  in       with having pioneered the development of the Z transform method in discrete time signal processing and analysis  These methods are now standard in digital signal processing  digital control  and other discrete time systems used in industry and research  He was an editor of the International Journal of Computational Cognition 
Zadeh s work also included computing with words and perceptions  His later papers include  From Search Engines to Question Answering Systems              and  Toward a Generalized Theory of Uncertainty  GTU  An Outline
