							Throughout the past three years  Egypt has been through tough but necessary economic reforms  undertaken by the authorities and supported by the International Monetary Fund  IMF  
The reforms aim to improve Egypt s public finances  curb the budget deficit  and get the currency shortage under control  all while achieving sustainable growth  The economic reforms came after several years that were marked by turbulence and uncertainty  with the Egyptian economy facing countless challenges  from political unrest and declining tourism to foreign currency and fuel shortages  
Hence  between September and November       authorities introduced the value added tax  VAT   a free floating currency  cut fuel subsidies  introduced social safety programmes   and went on a borrowing spree from the International Monetary Fund  IMF   the World Bank  China  and others to finance its ambitious programme 
To review the three years of reforms  Daily News Egypt sat down with Oumnia Boualam  country director at Oxford Business Group  OBG  for Egypt  so she can share her insights  and the views of the global publishing  research  and consultancy firm  which publishes economic intelligence on the markets of the Middle East  Africa  Asia  and Latin America  
How do you view Egypt s economic reform programme  Has it achieved its goals yet 
Each year  Oxford Business Group meets with         CEOs and business leaders across all sectors of the economy in order to understand the perspective of those involved in decision making on a daily basis  Being able to combine these perspectives with the hard data that is available allows us to shape our analysis and to make sure it is the most verified information available on the markets we cover  We have been in Egypt for    years now conducting this kind of intensive research  and over the past few years  we have seen Egypt undertake a very comprehensive economic reform programme  which has included monetary and fiscal reforms geared towards strengthening public finances  shoring up international reserves  encouraging private sector growth  and building investor confidence  As part of this reform programme  we have seen  among many other steps  subsidies reforms and the introduction of a VAT aimed at balancing the budget  as well as legal and regulatory reforms like the new Investment Law and the new Microfinance Law  Regulations in banking  for instance  have been rolled out that require commercial banks to allocate     of their portfolios to SMEs by        All this suggests significant progress is being made on the regulatory front and that the implementation of these reforms is well underway  Nevertheless  despite the improved macroeconomic picture  there is still progress to be made on a number of fronts  including structural reforms  unemployment  closing the housing gap  and financial inclusion  We are now working on the research for The Report  Egypt       so we will be following the economy as progress on these reforms continues 
What is the sufficient GDP growth rate to create enough jobs and achieve the aspirations of the Egyptian people 
GDP growth is one of several indicators of a country s economic growth  According to this metric  Egypt has one of the fastest growing economies in Africa and the rate of economic growth is expected to increase as the country continues to reap the benefits of its ongoing reforms  According to the IMF  GDP growth is forecast to reach      this year and      in       up from      last year  As you mention  and as has been highlighted by the IMF as well as President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi recently  one of the biggest challenges facing Egypt is the rate of population growth which is approximately      per year  With a population today of around    million people  this creates a huge demand for housing and jobs  Recently  at the fifth National Youth Conference  President Al Sisi said that GDP growth of      would be necessary to lift living standards in line with population growth   A focus on education and financial inclusion will help the impact of these reforms and the accompanying economic growth to be felt by the population more broadly 
In your report  you said that Egypt s tourism sector is expected to recover backed by growth in tourist arrivals  Do you think it can restore its      status and share of GDP 
Tourism s contribution to GDP in      accounted for        In comparison  in       tourism s direct contribution to GDP was       although the indirect effects of the industry increased the total contribution to      of GDP  Expanding by      in       the sector contributed to the upward revision of overall economic growth expectations for the country  Moving forward  the  industry should receive a boost from the resumption of direct flights to and from Russia  one of the country s largest sources of international visitors  as well as from the diversification of source markets for tourists to Egypt and enhanced security  Egypt has all the necessary tourist attractions  whether beaches or historical sites  and it has the infrastructure to accommodate those numbers  so the focus for the sector now will be on promoting Egypt as an attractive tourist destination 
Will geopolitical risks  Turkey Cyprus tensions  etc  be another stumbling block in the way of Egypt s aspiration to become a regional energy hub 
When it comes to Egypt s aspiration to become a regional focal point for hydrocarbon trade and power generation  many factors come into play  Geographical location is the obvious starting point  Being situated between Europe and sub Saharan Africa  and North Africa and the GCC with a solid infrastructure that can accommodate local production  as well as additional capacity  makes Egypt a natural hub  The energy sector in Egypt is one where we have seen reforms being implemented and there are a number of projects to expand power generation capabilities and refining capacity  at the same time that new discoveries and increasing production are helping to reduce Egypt s own import requirements  Recently signed memoranda of understanding with Europe and plans to share electricity with Saudi Arabia and Sudan indicate that Egypt is becoming increasingly important on the regional energy front 
How can the private sector tackle the education challenge  and how can governments assist 
Education is a sector where the challenges and the opportunities are closely tied to population growth  As the population grows  so does the burden on government provided services if it is unprepared  Ensuring accessibility as demand increases is perhaps the top priority because the education the population receives now will have an impact on economic growth across the board in the medium to long run  The private sector can be very effective in tackling challenges in areas like these where a rising demand for services or capacity requires a rapid response  That said  it is equally important for there to be an efficient regulatory environment that enables investment in order for the private sector to be effective  If you re building schools or clinics for instance  access to affordably priced land for building is just as necessary as having access to qualified staff  Allowing for creativity and freedom to come up with unique solutions should be balanced with ensuring that the care of education offered meets a certain standard  Moreover  as technology evolves  it should also provide additional solutions in both of these sectors and increase accessibility to quality services 
What are the main challenges that face the private sector in Egypt 
 The challenges differ from one sector to the other  The cost of imports  for instance  remains a challenge for sectors that rely on imported base materials and the price and availabilty of land affects a number of sectors  While regulations and bureaucratic efficiency are improving  this is an area where business would like to see continued progress  Nevertheless  there is greater clarity regarding the economic outlook and increased confidence in the economic growth from last year  which has been driving interest in investment opportunities
