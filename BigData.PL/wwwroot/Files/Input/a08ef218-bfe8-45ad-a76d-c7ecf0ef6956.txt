computer program written by Allen Newell  Herbert A  Simon and Cliff Shaw
Logic Theorist is a computer program written in      by Allen Newell  Herbert A  Simon  and Cliff Shaw             It was the first program deliberately engineered to perform automated reasoning  and has been described as  the first artificial intelligence program                  a      Logic Theorist proved    of the first    theorems in chapter two of Whitehead and Bertrand Russell s Principia Mathematica  and found new and shorter proofs for some of them            


History edit 
In       when Newell and Simon began to work on the Logic Theorist  the field of artificial intelligence did not yet exist  Even the term itself   artificial intelligence   would not be coined until the following summer      b     
Simon was a political scientist who had already produced classic work in the study of how bureaucracies function as well as developing his theory of bounded rationality  for which he would later win a Nobel Prize   The study of business organizations requires  like artificial intelligence  an insight into the nature of human problem solving and decision making  Simon remembers consulting at RAND Corporation in the early     s and seeing a printer typing out a map  using ordinary letters and punctuation as symbols  He realized that a machine that could manipulate symbols could just as well simulate decision making and possibly even the process of human thought                       
The program that printed the map had been written by Newell  a RAND scientist studying logistics and organization theory  For Newell  the decisive moment was in      when Oliver Selfridge came to RAND to describe his work on pattern matching  Watching the presentation  Newell suddenly understood how the interaction of simple  programmable units could accomplish complex behavior  including the intelligent behavior of human beings   It all happened in one afternoon   he would later say                        It was a rare moment of scientific epiphany 


 I had such a sense of clarity that this was a new path  and one I was going to go down  I haven t had that sensation very many times  I m pretty skeptical  and so I don t normally go off on a toot  but I did on that one  Completely absorbed in it without existing with the two or three levels consciousness so that you re working  and aware that you re working  and aware of the consequences and implications  the normal mode of thought  No  Completely absorbed for ten to twelve hours             
Newell and Simon began to talk about the possibility of teaching machines to think  Their first project was a program that could prove mathematical theorems like the ones used in Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead s Principia Mathematica  They enlisted the help of computer programmer Cliff Shaw  also from RAND  to develop the program   Newell says  Cliff was the genuine computer scientist of the three              

The first version was hand simulated  they wrote the program onto  x  cards and  as Simon recalled In January       we assembled my wife and three children together with some graduate students  To each member of the group  we gave one of the cards  so that each one became  in effect  a component of the computer program     Here was nature imitating art imitating nature             
They succeeded in showing that the program could successfully prove theorems as well as a talented mathematician  Eventually Shaw was able to run the program on the computer at RAND s Santa Monica facility 
In the summer of       John McCarthy  Marvin Minsky  Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester organized a conference on the subject of what they called  artificial intelligence   a term coined by McCarthy for the occasion   Newell and Simon proudly presented the group with the Logic Theorist  It was met with a lukewarm reception  Pamela McCorduck writes  the evidence is that nobody save Newell and Simon themselves sensed the long range significance of what they were doing               Simon confides that  we were probably fairly arrogant about it all              and adds 

They didn t want to hear from us  and we sure didn t want to hear from them  we had something to show them      In a way it was ironic because we already had done the first example of what they were after  and second  they didn t pay much attention to it             
Logic Theorist soon proved    of the first    theorems in chapter   of the Principia Mathematica  The proof of theorem      was actually more elegant than the proof produced laboriously by hand by Russell and Whitehead  Simon was able to show the new proof to Russell himself who  responded with delight              They attempted to publish the new proof in The Journal of Symbolic Logic  but it was rejected on the grounds that a new proof of an elementary mathematical theorem was not notable  apparently overlooking the fact that one of the authors was a computer program                        
Newell and Simon formed a lasting partnership  founding one of the first AI laboratories at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and developing a series of influential artificial intelligence programs and ideas  including the General Problem Solver  Soar  and their unified theory of cognition 

Architecture edit 
This is a brief presentation  based on             
The logical theorist is a program that performs logical processes on logical expressions 

Expressions edit 
An expression is made of elements 
There are two kinds of memories  working and storage 
Each working memory contains a single element  The logical theorist usually uses   to   working memories 
Each storage memory is a list representing a full expression or a set of elements  In particular  it contains all the axioms and proven logical theorems 
An expression is an abstract syntax tree  each node being an element with up to    attributes 
For example  the logical expression 
  
    
      
          xac 
        P
          x     
         
        Q
          x     
          xac 
        P
         
      
    
      displaystyle  neg P to  Q wedge  neg P  
  
 is represented as a tree with a root element representing 
  
    
      
          x     
      
    
      displaystyle  to  
  
  Among the attributes of the root element are pointers to the two elements representing the subexpressions 
  
    
      
          xac 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle  neg P 
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Q
          x     
          xac 
        P
      
    
      displaystyle Q wedge  neg P 
  
 

Processes edit 
There are four kinds of processes  from the lowest to the highest level 

instruction  These are similar to assembly code  They may either perform a primitive operation on an expression in working memory  or perform a conditional jump to another instruction  An example is  put the right sub element of working memory   to working memory   
elementary process  These are similar to subroutines  A sequence of instructions that can be called 
method  A sequence of elementary processes  There are just   methods 
substitution  given an expression  it attempts to transform it to a proven theorem or axiom by substitutions of variables and logical connectives 
detachment  given expression 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
      displaystyle B 
  
  it attempts to find a proven theorem or axiom of form 
  
    
      
        A
          x     
        
          B
            x     
        
      
    
      displaystyle A to B  
  
  where 
  
    
      
        
          B
            x     
        
      
    
      displaystyle B  
  
 yields 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
      displaystyle B 
  
 after substitution  then attempts to prove 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
      displaystyle A 
  
 by substitution 
chaining forward  given expression 
  
    
      
        A
          x     
        C
      
    
      displaystyle A to C 
  
  it attempts to find for a proven theorem or axiom of form 
  
    
      
        A
          x     
        B
      
    
      displaystyle A to B 
  
  then attempt to prove 
  
    
      
        B
          x     
        C
      
    
      displaystyle B to C 
  
 by substitution 
chaining backward  given expression 
  
    
      
        A
          x     
        C
      
    
      displaystyle A to C 
  
  it attempts to find for a proven theorem or axiom of form 
  
    
      
        B
          x     
        C
      
    
      displaystyle B to C 
  
  then attempt to prove 
  
    
      
        A
          x     
        B
      
    
      displaystyle A to B 
  
 by substitution 
executive control method  This method applies each of the   methods in sequence to each theorem to be proved 
Logic Theorist s influence on AI edit 
Logic Theorist introduced several concepts that would be central to AI research 

Reasoning as search
Logic Theorist explored a search tree  the root was the initial hypothesis  each branch was a deduction based on the rules of logic  Somewhere in the tree was the goal  the proposition the program intended to prove  The pathway along the branches that led to the goal was a proof        a series of statements  each deduced using the rules of logic  that led from the hypothesis to the proposition to be proved 
Heuristics
Newell and Simon realized that the search tree would grow exponentially and that they needed to  trim  some branches  using  rules of thumb  to determine which pathways were unlikely to lead to a solution  They called these ad hoc rules  heuristics   using a term introduced by George P lya in his classic book on mathematical proof  How to Solve It   Newell had taken courses from P lya at Stanford               Heuristics would become an important area of research in artificial intelligence and remains an important method to overcome the intractable combinatorial explosion of exponentially growing searches 
List processing
To implement Logic Theorist on a computer  the three researchers developed a programming language  IPL  which used the same form of symbolic list processing that would later form the basis of  McCarthy s Lisp programming language  an important language still used by AI researchers                         
Philosophical implications edit 
Pamela McCorduck writes that the Logic Theorist was  proof positive that a machine could perform tasks heretofore considered intelligent  creative and uniquely human              And  as such  it represents a milestone in the development of artificial intelligence and our understanding of intelligence in general 
Simon told a graduate class in January        Over Christmas  Al Newell and I invented a thinking machine                          
and would write 

 We  invented a computer program capable of thinking non numerically  and thereby solved the venerable mind body problem  explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind             
This statement  that machines can have minds just as people do  would be later named  Strong AI  by philosopher John Searle  It remains a serious subject of debate up to the present day 
Pamela McCorduck also sees in the Logic Theorist the debut of a new theory of the mind  the information processing model  sometimes called computationalism or cognitivism   She writes that  this view would come to be central to their later work  and in their opinion  as central to understanding mind in the   th century as Darwin s principle of natural selection had been to understanding biology in the nineteenth century               Newell and Simon would later formalize this proposal as the physical symbol systems hypothesis 

Notes edit 


  Logic theorist is usually considered the first true AI program  although Arthur Samuel s checkers program was released earlier  Christopher Strachey also wrote a checkers program in                 

  The term  artificial intelligence  was coined by John McCarthy in the proposal for the      Dartmouth Conference  The conference is  generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science   according to Daniel Crevier
