Propaganda method based on digital technologies
Computational propaganda is the use of computational tools  algorithms and automation  to distribute misleading information using social media networks  The advances in digital technologies and social media resulted in enhancement in methods of propaganda             It is characterized by automation  scalability  and anonymity            
Autonomous agents  internet bots  can analyze big data collected from social media and Internet of things in order to ensure manipulating public opinion in a targeted way  and what is more  to mimic real people in the social media             Coordination is an important component that bots help achieve  giving it an amplified reach             Digital technology enhance well established traditional methods of manipulation with public opinion  appeals to people s emotions and biases circumvent rational thinking and promote specific ideas            
A pioneering work            in identifying and analyzing of the concept has been done by the team of Philip N  Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute who since      have been investigating computational propaganda             following earlier Howard s research of the effects of social media on general public  published  e g   in his      book New Media Campaigns and the Managed Citizen and earlier articles  In       they published a series of articles detailing computational propaganda s presence in several countries            
Regulatory efforts have proposed tackling computational propaganda tactics using multiple approaches             Detection techniques are another front considered towards mitigation                         these can involve machine learning models  with early techniques having issues such as a lack of datasets or failing against the gradual improvement of accounts              Newer techniques to address these aspects use other machine learning techniques or specialized algorithms  yet other challenges remain such as increasingly believable text and its automation             


Mechanisms edit 
Computational propaganda is the strategic posting on social media of misleading information by fake accounts that are automated to a degree in order to manipulate readers             

Bots and coordination edit 
In social media  bots are accounts pretending to be human                                      They are managed to a degree via programs                          and are used to spread information that leads to mistaken impressions                          In social media  they may be referred to as  social bots   and may be helped by popular users that amplify them and make them seem reliable through sharing their content              Bots allow propagandists to keep their identities secret              One study from Oxford s Computational Propaganda Research Project indeed found that bots achieved effective placement in Twitter during a political event             
Bots can be coordinated                          which may be leveraged to make use of algorithms              Propagandists mix real and fake users              their efforts make use of a variety of actors  including botnets  online paid users  astroturfers  seminar users  and troll armies                         Bots can provide a fake sense of prevalence                          Bots can also engage in spam and harassment                          They are progressively becoming sophisticated  one reason being the improvement of AI              Such development complicates detection for humans and automatized methods alike             

Problematic information edit 
The problematic content tactics propagandists employ include disinformation  misinformation  and information shared regardless of veracity              The spread of fake and misleading information seeks to influence public opinion              Deepfakes and generative language models are also employed  creating convincing content              The proportion of misleading information is expected to grow  complicating detection             

Algorithmic influence edit 
Algorithms are another important element to computational propaganda              Algorithmic curation may influence beliefs through repetition              Algorithms boost and hide content  which propagandists use to their favor              Social media algorithms prioritize user engagement  and to that end their filtering prefers controversy and sensationalism              The algorithmic selection of what is presented can create echo chambers and assert influence             
One study poses that Tiktok s automated  e g  the sound page  and interactive  e g  stitching  duetting  and the content imitation trend  features can also boost misleading information             Furthermore  anonymity is kept through deleting the audio s origin            

Multidisciplinary studies edit 
A multidisciplinary approach has been proposed towards combating misinformation  proposing the use of psychology to understand its effectiveness              Some studies have looked at misleading information through the lens of cognitive processes  seeking insight into how humans come to accept it                         
Media theories can help understand the complexity of relationships present in computational propaganda and surrounding actors  its effect  and to guide regulation efforts              Agenda setting theory and framing theory have also been considered for analysis of computational propaganda phenomena  finding these effects present  algorithmic amplification is an instance of the former              which states media s selection and occlusion of topics influences the public s attention              It also states that repetition focuses said attention             
Repetition is a key characteristic of computational propaganda              in social media it can modify beliefs              One study posits that repetition makes topics fresh on the mind  having a similar effect on perceived significance              The Illusory Truth Effect  which states people will believe what is repeated to them over time  has also been suggested to bring into light that computational propaganda may be doing the same             
Other phenomena have been proposed to be at play in Computational Propaganda tools  One study posits the presence of the megaphone effect  the bandwagon effect  and cascades              Other studies point to the use of content that evokes emotions                         Another tactic used is suggesting connection between topics by placing them in the same sentence              Incidence of Trust bias  Validation By Intuition Rather Than Evidence  Truth Bias  Confirmation Bias  and Cognitive Dissonance are present as well              Another study points to the occurrence of Negativity Bias and Novelty Bias            

Spread edit 
Bots are used by both private and public parties             and have been observed in politics and crises              Its presence has been studied across many countries              with incidence in more than    countries                         Some studies have found bots to be effective                                     though another found limited impact              Similarly  algorithmic manipulation has been found to have an effect             

Regulation edit 
Some studies propose a strategy that incorporates multiple approaches towards regulation of the tools used in computational propaganda                         Controlling misinformation and its usage in politics through legislation and guidelines  having platforms combat fake accounts and misleading information  and devising psychology based intervention tactics are some of the possible measures             Information Literacy has also been proposed as an affront to these tools                                    
However  it has also been reported that some of these approaches have their faults  In Germany  for example  legislation efforts have encountered problems and opposition              In the case of social media  self regulation is hard to request             These platforms  measures also may not be enough and put the power of decision on them              Information literacy has its limits as well             

Detection edit 
Computational propaganda detection can focus either on content or on accounts            

Detecting propaganda content edit 
Two ways to detect propaganda content include analyzing the text through various means  called  Text Analysis   and tackling detecting coordination of users  called  Social Network Analysis                          Early techniques to detect coordination involved mostly supervised models such as decision trees  random forests  SVMs and neural networks              These just analyze accounts one by one without modeling coordination              Advanced bots and the difficulty in finding or creating datasets have hindered these detection methods              Modern detection techniques  strategies include making the model study a large group of accounts considering coordination  creating specialized algorithms for it  and building unsupervised and semi supervised models             

Detecting propaganda accounts edit 
Detecting accounts has a variety of approaches  they either seek to find the author of a piece  use statistical methods  analyze a mix of both text and data beyond it such as account characteristics  or scan user activity tendencies             This second focus also has a Social Network Analysis approach  with a technique that looks at time elements on campaigns alongside features of detected groups            

Limitations edit 
Detection techniques are not without their issues  One of them is that actors evolve their coordination techniques and can operate in the time it takes for detection methods to be created                         requiring real time approaches             Other challenges detection faces are that techniques have yet to adapt to different media formats  should integrate explainability  could inform the how and why of a propagandistic document or user  and may face increasingly difficult to detect content and may further be automatized              It is also presented with a lack of datasets  and creating them can involve sensitive user data that requires extensive work to protect them
