vteHistorically  some programming languages have been specifically designed for artificial intelligence  AI  applications  Nowadays  many general purpose programming languages also have libraries that can be used to develop AI applications 

General purpose languages edit 
Python is a high level  general purpose programming language that is popular in artificial intelligence             It has a simple  flexible and easily readable syntax             Its popularity results in a vast ecosystem of libraries  including for deep learning  such as PyTorch  TensorFlow  Keras  Google JAX  The library NumPy can be used for manipulating arrays  SciPy for scientific and mathematical analysis  Pandas for analyzing table data  Scikit learn for various machine learning tasks  NLTK and spaCy for natural language processing  OpenCV for computer vision  and Matplotlib for data visualization             Hugging Face s transformers library can manipulate large language models             Jupyter Notebooks can execute cells of Python code  retaining the context between the execution of cells  which usually facilitates interactive data exploration            
Elixir is a high level functional programming language based on the Erlang VM  Its machine learning ecosystem includes Nx for computing on CPUs and GPUs  Bumblebee and Axon for serving and training models  Broadway for distributed processing pipelines  Membrane for image and video processing  Livebook for prototyping and publishing notebooks  and Nerves for embedding on devices 
R is widely used in new style artificial intelligence  involving statistical computations  numerical analysis  the use of Bayesian inference  neural networks and in general machine learning  In domains like finance  biology  sociology or medicine it is considered one of the main standard languages  It offers several paradigms of programming like vectorial computation  functional programming and object oriented programming 
Lisp was the first language developed for artificial intelligence  It includes features intended to support programs that could perform general problem solving  such as lists  associations  schemas  frames   dynamic memory allocation  data types  recursion  associative retrieval  functions as arguments  generators  streams   and cooperative multitasking 
MATLAB is a proprietary numerical computing language developed by MathWorks  MATLAB has many toolboxes specifically for the development of AI including the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox and Deep Learning Toolbox  These toolboxes provide APIs for the high level and low level implementation and use of many types of machine learning models that can integrate with the rest of the MATLAB ecosystem  These  libraries also have support for  code generation for embedded hardware 
C   is a compiled language that can interact with low level hardware  In the context of AI  it is particularly used for embedded systems and robotics  Libraries such as TensorFlow C    Caffe or Shogun can be used            
JavaScript is widely used for web applications and can notably be executed with web browsers  Libraries for AI include TensorFlow js  Synaptic and Brain js            
Julia is a language launched in       which intends to combine ease of use and performance  It is mostly used for numerical analysis  computational science  and machine learning            
C  can be used to develop high level machine learning models using Microsoft s  NET suite  ML NET was developed to aid integration with existing  NET projects  simplifying the process for existing software using the  NET platform 
Smalltalk has been used extensively for simulations  neural networks  machine learning  and genetic algorithms  It implements a pure and elegant form of object oriented programming using message passing 
Haskell is a purely functional programming language  Lazy evaluation and the list and LogicT monads make it easy to express non deterministic algorithms  which is often the case  Infinite data structures are useful for search trees  The language s features enable a compositional way to express algorithms  Working with graphs is however a bit harder at first because of functional purity 
Wolfram Language includes a wide range of integrated machine learning abilities  from highly automated functions like Predict and Classify to functions based on specific methods and diagnostics  The functions work on many types of data  including numerical  categorical  time series  textual  and image            
Mojo can run some Python programs  and supports programmability of AI hardware  It aims to combine the usability of Python with the performance of low level programming languages like C   or Rust            
Specialized languages edit 
Prolog                        is a declarative language where programs are expressed in terms of relations  and execution occurs by running queries over these relations  Prolog is particularly useful for symbolic reasoning  database and language parsing applications 
Artificial Intelligence Markup Language  AIML              is an XML dialect             for use with Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity  A L I C E   type chatterbots 
Planner is a hybrid between procedural and logical languages  It gives a procedural interpretation to logical sentences where implications are interpreted with pattern directed inference 
Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver  STRIPS  is a language to express automated planning problem instances  It expresses an initial state  the goal states  and a set of actions  For each action preconditions  what must be established before the action is performed  and postconditions  what is established after the action is performed  are specified 
POP    is a reflective  incrementally compiled programming language with many of the features of an interpreted language  It is the core language of the Poplog programming environment developed originally by the University of Sussex  and recently in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham which hosts the Poplog website  It is often used to introduce symbolic programming techniques to programmers of more conventional languages like Pascal  who find POP syntax more familiar than that of Lisp  One of POP    s features is that it supports first class functions 
CycL is a special purpose language for Cyc
