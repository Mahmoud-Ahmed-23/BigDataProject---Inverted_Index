Observation that perception requires more computation than reasoning
Moravec s paradox is the observation in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics that  contrary to traditional assumptions  reasoning requires very little computation  but sensorimotor and perception skills require enormous computational resources  The principle was articulated in the     s by Hans Moravec  Rodney Brooks  Marvin Minsky  Allen Newell  and others  Newall presaged the idea  and characterized it as a myth of the field in a      chapter on the history of artificial intelligence   But
just because of that  a myth grew up that it was relatively easy to automate man s higher reasoning functions but very difficult to automate those functions man shared with the rest of the animal kingdom and performed well automatically  for example  recognition              Moravec wrote in        it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers  and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one year old when it comes to perception and mobility             
Similarly  Minsky emphasized that the most difficult human skills to reverse engineer are those that are below the level of conscious awareness   In general  we re least aware of what our minds do best   he wrote  and added   we re more aware of simple processes that don t work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly              Steven Pinker wrote in      that  the main lesson of thirty five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard             
By the     s  in accordance with Moore s law  computers were hundreds of millions of times faster than in the     s  and the additional computer power was finally sufficient to begin to handle perception and sensory skills  as Moravec had predicted in                   In       leading machine learning researcher Andrew Ng presented a  highly imperfect rule of thumb   that  almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought  we can probably now or in the near future automate using AI              There is currently no consensus as to which tasks AI tends to excel at            


The biological basis of human skills edit 
One possible explanation of the paradox  offered by Moravec  is based on evolution  All human skills are implemented biologically  using machinery designed by the process of natural selection  In the course of their evolution  natural selection has tended to preserve design improvements and optimizations  The older a skill is  the more time natural selection has had to improve the design  Abstract thought developed only very recently  and consequently  we should not expect its implementation to be particularly efficient 
As Moravec writes 

Encoded in the large  highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how to survive in it  The deliberate process we call reasoning is  I believe  the thinnest veneer of human thought  effective only because it is supported by this much older and much more powerful  though usually unconscious  sensorimotor knowledge  We are all prodigious olympians in perceptual and motor areas  so good that we make the difficult look easy  Abstract thought  though  is a new trick  perhaps less than     thousand years old  We have not yet mastered it  It is not all that intrinsically difficult  it just seems so when we do it            
A compact way to express this argument would be 

We should expect the difficulty of reverse engineering any human skill to be roughly proportional to the amount of time that skill has been evolving in animals 
The oldest human skills are largely unconscious and so appear to us to be effortless 
Therefore  we should expect skills that appear effortless to be difficult to reverse engineer  but skills that require effort may not necessarily be difficult to engineer at all 
Some examples of skills that have been evolving for millions of years  recognizing a face  moving around in space  judging people s motivations  catching a ball  recognizing a voice  setting appropriate goals  paying attention to things that are interesting  anything to do with perception  attention  visualization  motor skills  social skills and so on 
Some examples of skills that have appeared more recently  mathematics  engineering  games  logic and scientific reasoning  These are hard for us because they are not what our bodies and brains were primarily evolved to do  These are skills and techniques that were acquired recently  in historical time  and have had at most a few thousand years to be refined  mostly by cultural evolution 

Historical influence on artificial intelligence edit 
In the early days of artificial intelligence research  leading researchers often predicted that they would be able to create thinking machines in just a few decades  see history of artificial intelligence   Their optimism stemmed in part from the fact that they had been successful at writing programs that used logic  solved algebra and geometry problems and played games like checkers and chess  Logic and algebra are difficult for people and are considered a sign of intelligence  Many prominent researchers     a      assumed that  having  almost  solved the  hard  problems  the  easy  problems of vision and commonsense reasoning would soon fall into place  They were wrong  see also AI winter   and one reason is that these problems are not easy at all  but incredibly difficult  The fact that they had solved problems like logic and algebra was irrelevant  because these problems are extremely easy for machines to solve      b     
Rodney Brooks explains that  according to early AI research  intelligence was  best characterized as the things that highly educated male scientists found challenging   such as chess  symbolic integration  proving mathematical theorems and solving complicated word algebra problems   The things that children of four or five years could do effortlessly  such as visually distinguishing between a coffee cup and a chair  or walking around on two legs  or finding their way from their bedroom to the living room were not thought of as activities requiring intelligence  Nor were any aesthetic judgments included in the repertoire of intelligence based skills              
In the     s  this would lead Brooks to pursue a new direction in artificial intelligence and robotics research  He decided to build intelligent machines that had  No cognition  Just sensing and action  That is all I would build and completely leave out what traditionally was thought of as the intelligence of artificial intelligence               He called this new direction  Nouvelle AI

  Anthony Zador wrote in       
 Herbert Simon  a pioneer of artificial intelligence  AI   famously predicted in      that  machines will be capable  within twenty years  of doing any work a man can do          to achieve  human level  general AI             

  These are not the only reasons that their predictions did not come true  see History of artificial intelligence        Problems
