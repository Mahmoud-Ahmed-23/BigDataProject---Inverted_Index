A bar examination is an examination administered by the bar association of a jurisdiction that a lawyer must pass in order to be admitted to the bar of that jurisdiction            


Australia edit 
Administering bar exams is the responsibility of the bar association in the particular state or territory concerned  Those interested in pursuing a career at the bar must first be admitted as lawyers in the Supreme Court of their home state or territory   This generally requires the completion of legal studies which can take up to   years depending on the mode of study  the particular degree being completed and the law school              After completing a law degree  law graduates are then usually required to complete a period of Practical Legal Training  PLT             
During the PLT period  law graduates are provided with further legal education focusing more on the practical or technical aspects of the law  such as court practice  conveyancing and drafting statements of claim   Law graduates are also required to complete a minimum number of days under the supervision of a more senior lawyer 
After the successful completion of practical legal training  law graduates must then apply to be admitted to the Supreme Court in their state or territory   This ceremony is usually held with the chief justice of the state or territory presiding   It is a formal ceremony which also includes taking an oath  or making an affirmation  to uphold the laws of the jurisdiction and results in the person s name being recorded on the Roll of Practitioners in that jurisdiction            
Once admitted  those wishing to practise as barristers must contact the relevant bar association to register and sit the bar exam   The frequency and availability of these exams depends on the relevant bar association   Generally  the bar exams focus on three main areas of practice which are relevant to barristers  namely evidence  procedure and ethics   The exams are usually administered during the course of a day and comprise a variety of question types  usually answers are given in essay form   Candidates are informed of their results within a few months and pass rates are very competitive  Passing the bar exam in and of itself does not automatically allow one to practise as a barrister  in many jurisdictions  such as New South Wales  further requirements apply 

New South Wales edit 
In New South Wales  successful bar exam candidates are required to complete the NSW Bar Association Bar Practice Course  BPC   which despite its name  is a mandatory course required to be taken after passing the bar exam   The BPC consists of lectures  assignments and a significant amount of further reading about court procedure and case law              At the conclusion of the BPC  candidates are then required to appear in a mock trial             often before real judicial officers  and argue their respective case   Once satisfied that the candidate has completed these requirements  the NSW Bar Association then provides each candidate with their practising certificate            
Newly called barristers are referred to as readers            for a period of usually one year and are required to have at least one tutor who is barrister with at least seven years of call but is not Senior Counsel  
The initial practising certificate often contains restrictions on what type of work readers are permitted to do   This may include restrictions such as appearing in court alone  undertaking direct access briefs or any other restriction which the bar association deems appropriate   After the    month period and upon completion of further requirements such as civil and criminal reading to the bar associations satisfaction  readers are then provided with an unrestricted practising certificate and are no longer readers but barristers

Canada edit 
In Canada  admission to the bar is a matter of provincial or territorial jurisdiction  All provinces  except for Qu bec  follow a common law tradition              Lawyers in every common law province are qualified as both barristers and solicitors  and must pass a Barristers  Examination and Solicitors  Examination administered by the Law Society that governs the legal profession in their respective province or territory  The common law provinces all require prospective lawyers to complete a term of articles  usually    months  after graduation from law school during which they work under the supervision of a qualified lawyer  The bar exams may be taken after graduation from law school  but before the commencement of articling  or may be taken during or after articling is completed  Once the barristers  and solicitors  exams have been passed and the term of articles is successfully completed  students may then be called to the bar and admitted to the legal profession as lawyers  barristers and solicitors

England and Wales edit 
Since the UK has a separated legal profession  Law graduates in England and Wales can take examinations to qualify as a barrister or a solicitor by  either undertaking the Bar Professional Training Course  BPTC  or the Solicitors Qualification Exam  previously the  Legal Practice Course  LPC   respectively              These courses are the vocational part of the training required under the rules of the Bar Standards Board and the Solicitors Regulation Authority and are either undertaken on a full time basis for one year or on a part time basis over two years                           After successfully completing these courses  which generally include various examinations and practical ability tests  graduates must secure either a training contract  for those who have completed the LPC  or a pupillage  for those who have completed the BPTC   These are akin to articling positions in other jurisdictions and are the final practical stage before being granted full admission to practice  The general timescale therefore to become fully qualified after entering Law School can range between     years  assuming no repeats are required

Thailand edit 
In Thailand  the bar examination is separate from the lawyer licence  To practice law as a lawyer i e  to speak in the court one must pass a lawyer licence examination and does not need to be called to the bar  People take the bar examination to become qualified to take a judge or public prosecutor examination 
To be called to the bar  one must pass the written exams consisting of four parts as follows 

Civil and commercial law  intellectual property law  and international trade law 
Criminal law  employment law  constitution law  administrative law  and tax law 
Civil procedure law  bankruptcy and business reorganization law  and the system of the court of justice  And
Criminal procedure law  human rights  and law on the evidence 
Each part has    essay questions  The pass mark is     The parts     are usually taken in October and the rest are usually taken in March  One does not need to pass all four parts in one year  After passing all the written exams  there is an oral exam 
Around        bar students sit the exam each year  In             students were called to the bar      of whom did it in only one year 
Quite confusingly with international norms  students called to the bar are referred to as netibandit                            which means Barrister at Law in English   The Thai legal profession  however  is a fused one and those with lawyer licenses are able to practice both as barristers and solicitors in the British Commonwealth sense   Many students called to the bar choose to become judges or public prosecutors instead of lawyers   As the Thai bar examination  administered and awarded by the Thai Bar Association              is separate from the lawyers licensing scheme  administered and awarded by the Lawyers Council of Thailand               this means that judges and public prosecutors belong to a separate licensing organization from lawyers   This is unlike in the US where judges and prosecutors most often come from the ranks of senior lawyers and belong to the same bar 

United States edit 
Main article  Bar examination in the United States
In the United States  bar examinations are administered by agencies of individual states and territories  In almost all U S  states and territories  the bar examination is one of several requirements for admission to the bar  In most jurisdictions  the examination is two days long and consists of multiple choice questions  essay questions  and  performance tests  that model certain kinds of legal writing  The National Conference of Bar Examiners  NCBE  creates several component examinations that are used in varying combinations by all but two jurisdictions  sometimes in combination with locally drafted examination components  The main exceptions are Louisiana and Puerto Rico  which follow civil law systems unlike other parts of the United States 
Generally  earning a degree from a law school  or  more rarely  apprenticeship in a law office  is a prerequisite for taking the bar exam  Most law school graduates engage in a regimen of study  called  bar review   between graduating from law school and sitting for the bar
