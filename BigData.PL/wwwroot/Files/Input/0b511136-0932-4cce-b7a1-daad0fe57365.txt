In       the American Baptist Education Society incorporated a new University of Chicago as a coeducational                                   institution  using          donated to the ABES to supplement a          donation from Standard Oil co founder John D  Rockefeller              and land donated by Marshall Field              While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long term endowment  it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings  The Hyde Park campus  construction was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans such as Silas B  Cobb  who provided the funds for the campus s first building  Cobb Lecture Hall  and matched Marshall Field s pledge of           Other early benefactors included businessmen Charles L  Hutchinson  trustee  treasurer and donor of Hutchinson Commons   Martin A  Ryerson  president of the board of trustees and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory  Adolphus Clay Bartlett and Leon Mandel  who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall  and George C  Walker of the Walker Museum  a relative of Cobb who encouraged his inaugural donation for facilities             
The new university acknowledged its predecessor               The university s coat of arms has a phoenix rising from the ashes  a reference to the fire and foreclosure of the Old University of Chicago              A single stone from the rubble of the original Douglas Hall on   th Place was set into the wall of the Classics Building  The dean of the college and University of Chicago and professor of history John Boyer has argued that the University of Chicago has  a plausible genealogy as a pre Civil War institution               Alumni from the Old University of Chicago are recognized as alumni of the University of Chicago             
William Rainey Harper became the university s president on July          and the Hyde Park campus opened for classes on October                      Harper worked on building up the faculty and in two years he had a faculty of      including eight former university or college presidents              Harper was an accomplished scholar  Semiticist  and a member of the Baptist clergy who believed that a great university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus              To fulfill this commitment  he brought the Baptist seminary that had begun as an independent school  alongside  the Old University of Chicago and separated from the old school decades earlier to Morgan Park  This became the Divinity School in       the first professional school at the University of Chicago                                     
Harper recruited acclaimed Yale baseball and football player Amos Alonzo Stagg from the Young Men s Christian Association training school at Springfield to coach the school s football program              Stagg was given a position on the faculty  the first such athletic position in the United States      citation needed      While coaching at the university  Stagg invented the numbered football jersey and the huddle              Stagg is the namesake of the university s Stagg Field      citation needed

In the     s  the university  fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students  affiliated with several regional colleges and universities  Des Moines College  Kalamazoo College  Butler University  and Stetson University  In       the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll  Illinois  Under the terms of the affiliation  the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university  to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals  to make no faculty appointment without the university s approval  and to send copies of examinations for suggestions  The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years  and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago  A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago  and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work  The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost  special instructors and lecturers without cost except for travel expenses  and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost  The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice  Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program  as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part  and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university  The program was ended by
