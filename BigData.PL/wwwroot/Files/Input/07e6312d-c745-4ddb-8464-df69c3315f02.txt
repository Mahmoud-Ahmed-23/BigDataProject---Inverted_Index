It offers functions for data transformation  aggregation and visualization  which are important for analysis  Created by Wes McKinney in       Pandas widely used by data scientists  analysts and researchers worldwide  Pandas revolves around two primary Data structures  Series   D  for single columns and DataFrame   D  for tabular data enabling efficient data manipulation 
Important Facts to Know  
DataFrames  It is a two dimensional data structure constructed with rows and columns  which is more similar to Excel spreadsheet pandas  This name is derived for the term        panel data        which is econometrics terms of data sets What is Pandas Used for With pandas  you can perform a wide range of data operations  including
Reading and writing data from various file formats like CSV  Excel and SQL databases Cleaning and preparing data by handling missing values and filtering entries Merging and joining multiple datasets seamlessly Reshaping data through pivoting and stacking operations Conducting statistical analysis and generating descriptive statistics Visualizing data with integrated plotting capabilities Why Learn PandasHere s why it s worth learning 
It offers a simple and intuitive way to work with structured data  especially using DataFrames Makes data exploration easy  so you can quickly understand patterns or spot issues Saves time by reducing the need for complex code It       s widely used in industries like finance  healthcare  marketing and research A must have skill for data science  analytics and machine learning roles Pandas BasicsIn this section  we will explore the fundamentals of Pandas  We will start with an introduction to Pandas  learn how to install it and get familiar with its functionalities  Additionally  we will cover how to use Jupyter Notebook  a popular tool for interactive coding  By the end of this section  we will have a solid understanding of how to set up and start working with Pandas for data analysis
