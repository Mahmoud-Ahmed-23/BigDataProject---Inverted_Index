Approach to artificial intelligence
See also  situated and behavior based AI
Nouvelle artificial intelligence  AI  is an approach to artificial intelligence pioneered in the     s by Rodney Brooks  who was then part of MIT artificial intelligence laboratory             Nouvelle AI differs from classical AI by aiming to produce robots with intelligence levels similar to insects  Researchers believe that intelligence can emerge organically from simple behaviors as these intelligences interacted with the  real world   instead of using the constructed worlds which symbolic AIs typically needed to have programmed into them            


Motivation edit 
The differences between nouvelle AI and symbolic AI are apparent in early robots Shakey and Freddy  These robots contained an internal model  or  representation   of their micro worlds consisting of symbolic descriptions  As a result  this structure of symbols had to be renewed as the robot moved or the world changed 
Shakey s planning programs assessed the program structure and broke it down into the necessary steps to complete the desired action  This level of computation required a large amount time to process  so Shakey typically performed its tasks very slowly 
Symbolic AI researchers had long been plagued by the problem of updating  searching  and otherwise manipulating the symbolic worlds inside their AIs  A nouvelle system refers continuously to its sensors rather than to an internal model of the world  It processes the external world information it needs from the senses when it is required  As Brooks puts it   the world is its own best model  always exactly up to date and complete in every detail  
A central idea of nouvelle AI is that simple behaviors combine to form more complex behaviors over time  For example  simple behaviors can include elements like  move forward  and  avoid obstacles   A robot using nouvelle AI with simple behaviors like collision avoidance and moving toward a moving object could possibly come together to produce a more complex behavior like chasing a moving object 

The frame problem edit 
                                 
The frame problem describes an issue with using first order logic  FOL  to express facts about a robot in the world  Representing the state of a robot with traditional FOL requires the use of many axioms  symbolic language  to imply that things about an environment do not change arbitrarily 
Nouvelle AI seeks to sidestep the frame problem by dispensing with filling the AI or robot with volumes of symbolic language and instead letting more complex behaviors emerge by combining simpler behavioral elements 

Embodiment edit 
           
The goal of traditional AI was to build intelligences without bodies  which would only have been able to interact with the world via keyboard  screen  or printer  However  nouvelle AI attempts to build embodied intelligence situated in the real world  Brooks quotes approvingly from the brief sketches that Turing gave in      and      of the  situated  approach  Turing wrote of equipping a machine  with the best sense organs that money can buy  and teaching it  to understand and speak English  by a process that would  follow the normal teaching of a child   This approach was contrasted to the others where they focused on abstract activities such as playing chess 

Brooks  robots edit 
Insectoid robots edit 
Brooks focused on building robots that acted like simple insects while simultaneously working to remove some traditional AI characteristics  He created insect like robots  named Allen and Herbert after cognitive science and AI pioneers Allen Newell and Herbert A  Simon                       
Brooks s insectoid robots contained no internal models of the world  Herbert  for example  discarded a high volume of the information received from its sensors and never stored information for more than two seconds 

Allen edit 
Allen had a ring of twelve ultrasonic sonars as its primary sensors and three independent behavior producing modules  These modules were programmed to avoid both stationary and moving objects  With only this module activated  Allen stayed in the middle of a room until an object approached and then it ran away while avoiding obstacles in its way            

Herbert edit 
Herbert used infrared sensors to avoid obstacles and a laser system to collect  D data over a distance of about    feet  Herbert also carried a number of simple sensors in its  hand   The robot s testing ground was the real world environment of the busy offices and workspaces of the MIT AI lab where it searched for empty soda cans and carried them away  a seemingly goal oriented activity that emerged as a result of    simple behavior units combining  As a parallel  Simon noted that an ant s complicated path is due to the structure of its environment rather than the depth of its thought processes            

Other insectoid robots edit 
Other robots by Brooks  team were Genghis and Squirt             Genghis had six legs and was able to walk over rough terrain and follow a human  Squirt s behavior modules had it stay in dark corners until it heard a noise  then it would begin to follow the source of the noise 
Brooks agreed that the level of nouvelle AI had come near the complexity of a real insect  which raised a question about whether or not insect level behavior was and is a reasonable goal for nouvelle AI 

Humanoid robots edit 
Brooks  own recent work has taken the opposite direction to that proposed by Von Neumann in the quotations  theorists who select the human nervous system as their model are unrealistically picking  the most complicated object under the sun   and that there is little advantage in selecting instead the ant  since any nervous system at all exhibits exceptional complexity              

Cog edit 
In the     s  Brooks decided to pursue the goal of human level intelligence and  with Lynn Andrea Stein  built a humanoid robot called Cog  Cog is a robot with an extensive collection of sensors  a face  and arms  among other features  that allow it to interact with the world and gather information and experience so as to assemble intelligence organically in the manner described above by Turing 
The team believed that Cog would be able to learn and able to find a correlation between the sensory information it received and its actions  and to learn common sense knowledge on its own  As of       all development of the project had ceased
