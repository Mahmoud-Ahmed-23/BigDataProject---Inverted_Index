Philosophical position
In the philosophy of mind  functionalism is the thesis that each and every mental state  for example  the state of having a belief  of having a desire  or of being in pain  is constituted solely by its functional role  which means its causal relation to other mental states  sensory inputs  and behavioral outputs             Functionalism developed largely as an alternative to the identity theory of mind and behaviorism 
Functionalism is a theoretical level between the physical implementation and behavioral output             Therefore  it is different from its predecessors of Cartesian dualism  advocating independent mental and physical substances  and Skinnerian behaviorism and physicalism  declaring only physical substances  because it is only concerned with the effective functions of the brain  through its organization or its  software programs  
Since a mental state is identified by a functional role  it is said to be realized on multiple levels  in other words  it is able to be manifested in various systems  even perhaps computers  so long as the system performs the appropriate functions  While a computer s program performs the functions via computations on inputs to give outputs  implemented via its electronic substrate  a brain performs the functions via its biological operation and stimulus responses 


Multiple realizability edit 
An important part of some arguments for functionalism is the idea of multiple realizability  According to standard functionalist theories  a mental state corresponds to a functional role  It is like a valve  a valve can be made of plastic or metal or other material  as long as it performs the proper function  controlling the flow of a liquid or gas   Similarly  functionalists argue  a mental state can be explained without considering the state of the underlying physical medium  such as the brain  that realizes it  one only needs to consider higher level functions  Because a mental state is not limited to a particular medium  it can be realized in multiple ways  including  theoretically  with non biological systems  such as computers  A silicon based machine could have the same sort of mental life that a human being has  provided that its structure realized the proper functional roles 
While most functionalist theories accept the multiple realizability of mental states  some functionalist theories  such as the Functional Specification Theories  FSTs   reject this view             FSTs were most notably developed by David Lewis            and David Malet Armstrong             According to FSTs  mental states are the particular  realizers  of the functional role  not the functional role itself  The mental state of belief  for example  just is whatever brain or neurological process that realizes the appropriate belief function  Thus  unlike standard versions of functionalism  often called Functional State Identity Theories   FSTs do not allow for the multiple realizability of mental states  because the fact that mental states are realized by brain states is essential  What often drives this view is the belief that if we were to encounter an alien race with a cognitive system composed of significantly different material from humans   e g   silicon based  but performed the same functions as human mental states  for example  they tend to yell  Ouch   when poked with sharp objects   we would say that their type of mental state might be similar to ours but it is not the same  For some  this may be a disadvantage to FSTs  Indeed  one of Hilary Putnam s                       arguments for his version of functionalism relied on the intuition that such alien creatures would have the same mental states as humans do  and that the multiple realizability of standard functionalism makes it a better theory of mind 

Types edit 
Machine state functionalism edit 
 Artistic representation of a Turing machine
The broad position of  functionalism  can be articulated in many different varieties  The first formulation of a functionalist theory of mind was put forth by Hilary Putnam                       in the     s  This formulation  which is now called machine state functionalism  or just machine functionalism  was inspired by the analogies which Putnam and others noted between the mind and the theoretical  machines  or computers capable of computing any given algorithm which were developed by Alan Turing  called Turing machines   Putnam himself  by the mid     s  had begun questioning this position  The beginning of his opposition to machine state functionalism can be read about in his Twin Earth thought experiment 
In non technical terms  a Turing machine is not a physical object  but rather an abstract machine built upon a mathematical model  Typically  a Turing Machine has a horizontal tape divided into rectangular cells arranged from left to right  The tape itself is infinite in length  and each cell may contain a symbol  The symbols used for any given  machine  can vary  The machine has a read write head that scans cells and moves in left and right directions  The action of the machine is determined by the symbol in the cell being scanned and a table of transition rules that serve as the machine s programming  Because of the infinite tape  a traditional Turing Machine has an infinite amount of time to compute any particular function or any number of functions  In the below example  each cell is either blank  B  or has a   written on it  These are the inputs to the machine  The possible outputs are 

Halt  Do nothing 
R  move one square to the right 
L  move one square to the left 
B  erase whatever is on the square 
   erase whatever is on the square and print a    
An extremely simple example of a Turing machine which
writes out the sequence       after scanning three blank squares and then stops as specified by the following machine table 




State One
State Two
State Three


B
write    stay in state  
write    stay in state  
write    stay in state  


 
go right  go to state  
go right  go to state  
 halt 


This table states that if the machine is in state one and scans a blank square  B   it will print a   and remain in state one  If it is in state one and reads a    it will move one square to the right and also go into state two  If it is in state two and reads a B  it will print a   and stay in state two  If it is in state two and reads a    it will move one square to the right and go into state three  If it is in state three and reads a B  it prints a   and remains in state three  Finally  if it is in state three and reads a    then it will stay in state three 
The essential point to consider here is the nature of the states of the Turing machine  Each state can be defined exclusively in terms of its relations to the other states as well as inputs and outputs  State one  for example  is simply the state in which the machine  if it reads a B  writes a   and stays in that state  and in which  if it reads a    it moves one square to the right and goes into a different state  This is the functional definition of state one  it is its causal role in the overall system  The details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant  
The above point is critical to an understanding of machine state functionalism  Since Turing machines are not required to be physical systems   anything capable of going through a succession of states in time can be a Turing machine              Because biological organisms  go through a succession of states in time   any such organisms could also be equivalent to Turing machines   
According to machine state functionalism  the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of the Turing machine states described above  If one can show the rational functioning and computing skills of these machines to be comparable to the rational functioning and computing skills of human beings  it follows that Turing machine behavior closely resembles that of human beings             Therefore  it is not a particular physical chemical composition responsible for the particular machine or mental state  it is the programming rules which produce the effects that are responsible  To put it another way  any rational preference is due to the rules being followed  not to the specific material composition of the agent 

Psycho functionalism edit 
A second form of functionalism is based on the rejection of behaviorist theories in psychology and their replacement with empirical cognitive models of the mind  This view is most closely associated with Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn and has been labeled psycho functionalism 
The fundamental idea of psycho functionalism is that psychology is an irreducibly complex science and that the terms that we use to describe the entities and properties of the mind in our best psychological theories cannot be redefined in terms of simple behavioral dispositions  and further  that such a redefinition would not be desirable or salient were it achievable  Psychofunctionalists view psychology as employing the same sorts of irreducibly teleological or purposive explanations as the biological sciences  Thus  for example  the function or role of the heart is to pump blood  that of the kidney is to filter it and to maintain certain chemical balances and so on this is what accounts for the purposes of scientific explanation and taxonomy  There may be an infinite variety of physical realizations for all of the mechanisms  but what is important is only their role in the overall biological theory  In an analogous manner  the role of mental states  such as belief and desire  is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best scientific psychological theory  If some mental state which is postulated by folk psychology  e g  hysteria  is determined not to have any fundamental role in cognitive psychological explanation  then that particular state may be considered not to exist 
On the other hand  if it turns out that there are states which theoretical cognitive psychology posits as necessary for explanation of human behavior but which are not foreseen by ordinary folk psychological language  then these entities or states exist 

Analytic functionalism edit 
A third form of functionalism is concerned with the meanings of theoretical terms in general  This view is most closely associated with David Lewis and is often referred to as analytic functionalism or conceptual functionalism  The basic idea of analytic functionalism is that theoretical terms are implicitly defined by the theories in whose formulation they occur and not by intrinsic properties of the phonemes they comprise  In the case of ordinary language terms  such as  belief    desire   or  hunger   the idea is that such terms get their meanings from our common sense  folk psychological  theories about them  but that such conceptualizations are not sufficient to withstand the rigor imposed by materialistic theories of reality and causality  Such terms are subject to conceptual analyses which take something like the following form 

Mental state M is the state that is preconceived by P and causes Q 
For example  the state of pain is caused by sitting on a tack and causes loud cries  and higher order mental states of anger and resentment directed at the careless person who left a tack lying around  These sorts of functional definitions in terms of causal roles are claimed to be analytic and a priori truths about the submental states and the  largely fictitious  propositional attitudes they describe  Hence  its proponents are known as analytic or conceptual functionalists  The essential difference between analytic and psychofunctionalism is that the latter emphasizes the importance of laboratory observation and experimentation in the determination of which mental state terms and concepts are genuine and which functional identifications may be considered to be genuinely contingent and a posteriori identities  The former  on the other hand  claims that such identities are necessary and not subject to empirical scientific investigation 

Homuncular functionalism edit 
Homuncular functionalism was developed largely by Daniel Dennett and has been advocated by William Lycan  It arose in response to the challenges that Ned Block s China Brain  a k a  Chinese nation  and John Searle s Chinese room thought experiments presented for the more traditional forms of functionalism  see below under  Criticism    In attempting to overcome the conceptual difficulties that arose from the idea of a nation full of Chinese people wired together  each person working as a single neuron to produce in the wired together whole the functional mental states of an individual mind  many functionalists simply bit the bullet  so to speak  and argued that such a Chinese nation would indeed possess all of the qualitative and intentional properties of a mind  i e  it would become a sort of systemic or collective mind with propositional attitudes and other mental characteristics  Whatever the worth of this latter hypothesis  it was immediately objected that it entailed an unacceptable sort of mind mind supervenience  the systemic mind which somehow emerged at the higher level must necessarily supervene on the individual minds of each individual member of the Chinese nation  to stick to Block s formulation  But this would seem to put into serious doubt  if not directly contradict  the fundamental idea of the supervenience thesis  there can be no change in the mental realm without some change in the underlying physical substratum  This can be easily seen if we label the set of mental facts that occur at the higher level M  and the set of mental facts that occur at the lower level M   Then M  and M  both supervene on the physical facts  but a change of M  to M   say  could occur without any change in these facts 
Since mind mind supervenience seemed to have become acceptable in functionalist circles  it seemed to some that the only way to resolve the puzzle was to postulate the existence of an entire hierarchical series of mind levels  analogous to homunculi  which became less and less sophisticated in terms of functional organization and physical composition all the way down to the level of the physico mechanical neuron or group of neurons  The homunculi at each level  on this view  have authentic mental properties but become simpler and less intelligent as one works one s way down the hierarchy 

Mechanistic functionalism edit 
Mechanistic functionalism  originally formulated and defended by Gualtiero Piccinini             and Carl Gillett                         independently  augments previous functionalist accounts of mental states by maintaining that any psychological explanation must be rendered in mechanistic terms  That is  instead of mental states receiving a purely functional explanation in terms of their relations to other mental states  like those listed above  functions are seen as playing only a part the other part being played by structures  of the explanation of a given mental state 
A mechanistic explanation             involves decomposing a given system  in this case a mental system  into its component physical parts  their activities or functions  and their combined organizational relations              On this account the mind remains a functional system  but one that is understood in mechanistic terms  This account remains a sort of functionalism because functional relations are still essential to mental states  but it is mechanistic because the functional relations are always manifestations of concrete structures albeit structures understood at a certain level of abstraction  Functions are individuated and explained either in terms of the contributions they make to the given system             or in teleological terms  If the functions are understood in teleological terms  then they may be characterized either etiologically or non etiologically                
Mechanistic functionalism leads functionalism away from the traditional functionalist autonomy of psychology from neuroscience and towards integrating psychology and neuroscience              By providing an applicable framework for merging traditional psychological models with neurological data  mechanistic functionalism may be understood as reconciling the functionalist theory of mind with neurological accounts of how the brain actually works  This is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states  mental states  are physically realized through neurological mechanisms 

Physicalism edit 
There is much confusion about the sort of relationship that is claimed to exist  or not exist  between the general thesis of functionalism and physicalism  It has often been claimed that functionalism somehow  disproves  or falsifies physicalism tout court  i e  without further explanation or description   On the other hand  most philosophers of mind who are functionalists claim to be physicalists indeed  some of them  such as David Lewis  have claimed to be strict reductionist type physicalists 
Functionalism is fundamentally what Ned Block has called a broadly metaphysical thesis as opposed to a narrowly ontological one  That is  functionalism is not so much concerned with what there is than with what it is that characterizes a certain type of mental state  e g  pain  as the type of state that it is  Previous attempts to answer the mind body problem have all tried to resolve it by answering both questions  dualism says there are two substances and that mental states are characterized by their immateriality  behaviorism claimed that there was one substance and that mental states were behavioral disposition  physicalism asserted the existence of just one substance and characterized the mental states as physical states  as in  pain   C fiber firings   
On this understanding  type physicalism can be seen as incompatible with functionalism  since it claims that what characterizes mental states  e g  pain  is that they are physical in nature  while functionalism says that what characterizes pain is its functional causal role and its relationship with yelling  ouch   etc  However  any weaker sort of physicalism which makes the simple ontological claim that everything that exists is made up of physical matter is perfectly compatible with functionalism  Moreover  most functionalists who are physicalists require that the properties that are quantified over in functional definitions be physical properties  Hence  they are physicalists  even though the general thesis of functionalism itself does not commit them to being so 
In the case of David Lewis  there is a distinction in the concepts of  having pain   a rigid designator true of the same things in all possible worlds  and just  pain   a non rigid designator   Pain  for Lewis  stands for something like the definite description  the state with the causal role x   The referent of the description in humans is a type of brain state to be determined by science  The referent among silicon based life forms is something else  The referent of the description among angels is some immaterial  non physical state  For Lewis  therefore  local type physical reductions are possible and compatible with conceptual functionalism   See also Lewis s mad pain and Martian pain   There seems to be some confusion between types and tokens that needs to be cleared up in the functionalist analysis 

Criticism edit 
In a      PhilPapers survey  functionalism emerged as the most popular theory  with     of respondents accepting or leaning towards it  followed by dualism at      and identity theory at                  Nevertheless  functionalism has counter intuitive implications  often criticized using thought experiments 

China brain edit 
Main article  China brain
Ned Block             argues against the functionalist proposal of multiple realizability  where hardware implementation is irrelevant because only the functional level is important  The  China brain  or  Chinese nation  thought experiment involves supposing that the entire nation of China systematically organizes itself to operate just like a brain  with each individual acting as a neuron   The tremendous difference in speed of operation of each unit is not addressed    According to functionalism  so long as the people are performing the proper functional roles  with the proper causal relations between inputs and outputs  the system will be a real mind  with mental states  consciousness  and so on  Ned Block contends that this scenario is implausible  suggesting that there must be a flaw in the functionalist thesis if it allows such a system to be considered a legitimate mind 
Some functionalists believe China would have qualia but that due to the size it is impossible to imagine China being conscious              Indeed  it may be the case that we are constrained by our theory of mind             and will never be able to understand what Chinese nation consciousness is like  Therefore  if functionalism is true  either qualia will be present in any system that performs the correct functions  regardless of its physical structure  or qualia do not exist at all and are merely illusions             

The Chinese room edit 
Main article  Chinese room
The Chinese room argument by John Searle             is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions  The thought experiment asserts that it is possible to mimic intelligent action without any interpretation or understanding through the use of a purely functional system  In short  Searle describes a person who only speaks English who is in a room with only Chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in English for moving the symbols around  The person is then ordered by people outside of the room to follow the rule book for sending certain symbols out of the room when given certain symbols  Further suppose that the people outside of the room are Chinese speakers and are communicating with the person inside via the Chinese symbols  According to Searle  it would be absurd to claim that the English speaker inside knows Chinese simply based on these syntactic processes  This thought experiment attempts to show that systems which operate merely on syntactic processes  inputs and outputs  based on algorithms  cannot realize any semantics  meaning  or intentionality  aboutness   Thus  Searle attacks the idea that thought can be equated with following a set of syntactic rules 
One common response to Searle s thought experiment is that there is a form of mental activity going on at a higher level than the man  and that the whole system needs to be considered  This suggests that the system does understand Chinese  even though the man in the room doesn t  The man is analogized to a CPU in a computer system  In response  Searle suggested the man in the room could memorize all the rules and symbol relations  Even if he internalized all the rules and performed the operations in his mind  he would still be manipulating symbols without understanding their meaning  according to Searle  Some critics consider that this symbol manipulating subsystem of the brain can be viewed as a kind of separate  virtual mind  which would understand Chinese             
Functionalists also argue that it would be possible in theory to make a system that emulates on digital hardware each neuron of the brain of someone who understands Chinese  and that such a brain emulation would have the same mental processes  and would thus understand Chinese             

Inverted spectrum edit 
Main article  Inverted spectrum
Another main criticism of functionalism is the inverted spectrum or inverted qualia scenario  most specifically proposed as an objection to functionalism by Ned Block                          This thought experiment involves supposing that there is a person  call her Jane  that is born with a condition which makes her see the opposite spectrum of light that is normally perceived  Unlike normal people  Jane sees the color violet as yellow  orange as blue  and so forth  So  suppose  for example  that you and Jane are looking at the same orange  While you perceive the fruit as colored orange  Jane sees it as colored blue  However  when asked what color the piece of fruit is  both you and Jane will report  orange   In fact  one can see that all of your behavioral as well as functional relations to colors will be the same  Jane will  for example  properly obey traffic signs just as any other person would  even though this involves the color perception  Therefore  the argument goes  since there can be two people who are functionally identical  yet have different mental states  differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects   functionalism is not robust enough to explain individual differences in qualia                         
According to David Chalmers  all  functionally isomorphic  systems  those with the same  fine grained functional organization   i e   the same information processing  will have qualitatively identical conscious experiences  He calls this the principle of organizational invariance  For example  it implies that a silicon chip that is functionally isomorphic to a brain will have the same perception of the color red  given the same sensory inputs  He proposed the thought experiment of the  dancing qualia  to demonstrate it  It is a reductio ad absurdum argument that starts by supposing that two such systems have different qualia in the same situation  It involves a switch that alternates between a chunk of brain that causes the perception of red  and a functionally isomorphic system that causes the perception of blue  for example implemented as a silicon chip  Since both perform the same function within the brain  the subject would not notice any change during the switch  Chalmers argues that this would be highly implausible if the qualia were truly switching between red and blue  hence the contradiction  Therefore  he concludes that the dancing qualia is impossible in practice  and the equivalent digital system would not only experience qualia  but it would have conscious experiences that are qualitatively identical to those of the biological system  e g   seeing the same color   He also proposed a similar thought experiment  named the fading qualia  that argues that it is not possible for the qualia to fade when each biological neuron is replaced by a functional equivalent                         
A related critique of the inverted spectrum argument is that it assumes that mental states  differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects  can be independent of the functional relations in the brain  Thus  it begs the question of functional mental states  its assumption denies the possibility of functionalism itself  without offering any independent justification for doing so  functionalism says that mental states are produced by the functional relations in the brain   This same type of problem that there is no argument  just an antithetical assumption at their base can also be said of both the Chinese room and the Chinese nation arguments      citation needed     

Twin Earth edit 
Main article  Twin Earth thought experiment
The Twin Earth thought experiment  introduced by Hilary Putnam              is responsible for one of the main arguments used against functionalism  although it was originally intended as an argument against semantic internalism  The thought experiment is simple and runs as follows  Imagine a Twin Earth which is identical to Earth in every way but one  water does not have the chemical structure H O  but rather some other structure  say XYZ  It is critical  however  to note that XYZ on Twin Earth is still called  water  and exhibits all the same macro level properties that H O exhibits on Earth  i e   XYZ is also a clear drinkable liquid that is in lakes  rivers  and so on   Since these worlds are identical in every way except in the underlying chemical structure of water  you and your Twin Earth doppelg nger see exactly the same things  meet exactly the same people  have exactly the same jobs  behave exactly the same way  and so on  In other words  since you share the same inputs  outputs  and relations between other mental states  you are functional duplicates  So  for example  you both believe that water is wet  However  the content of your mental state of believing that water is wet differs from your duplicate s because your belief is of H O  while your duplicate s is of XYZ  Therefore  so the argument goes  since two people can be functionally identical  yet have different mental states  functionalism cannot sufficiently account for all mental states 
Most defenders of functionalism initially responded to this argument by attempting to maintain a sharp distinction between internal and external content  The internal contents of propositional attitudes  for example  would consist exclusively in those aspects of them which have no relation with the external world and which bear the necessary functional causal properties that allow for relations with other internal mental states  Since no one has yet been able to formulate a clear basis or justification for the existence of such a distinction in mental contents  however  this idea has generally been abandoned in favor of externalist causal theories of mental contents  also known as informational semantics   Such a position is represented  for example  by Jerry Fodor s account of an  asymmetric causal theory  of mental content  This view simply entails the modification of functionalism to include within its scope a very broad interpretation of inputs and outputs to include the objects that are the causes of mental representations in the external world 
The twin earth argument hinges on the assumption that experience with an imitation water would cause a different mental state than experience with natural water  However  since no one would notice the difference between the two waters  this assumption is likely false  Further  this basic assumption is directly antithetical to functionalism  and  thereby  the twin earth argument does not constitute a genuine argument  as this assumption entails a flat denial of functionalism itself  which would say that the two waters would not produce different mental states  because the functional relationships would remain unchanged  

Meaning holism edit 
Another common criticism of functionalism is that it implies a radical form of semantic holism  Block and Fodor             referred to this as the damn darn problem  The difference between saying  damn  or  darn  when one smashes one s finger with a hammer can be mentally significant  But since these outputs are  according to functionalism  related to many  if not all  internal mental states  two people who experience the same pain and react with different outputs must share little  perhaps nothing  in common in any of their mental states      dubious             discuss      But this is counterintuitive  it seems clear that two people share something significant in their mental states of being in pain if they both smash their finger with a hammer  whether or not they utter the same word when they cry out in pain 
Another possible solution to this problem is to adopt a moderate  or molecularist  form of holism  But even if this succeeds in the case of pain  in the case of beliefs and meaning  it faces the difficulty of formulating a distinction between relevant and non relevant contents  which can be difficult to do without invoking an analytic synthetic distinction  as many seek to avoid  

Triviality arguments edit 
According to Ned Block  if functionalism is to avoid the chauvinism of type physicalism  it becomes overly liberal in  ascribing mental properties to things that do not in fact have them               As an example  he proposes that the economy of Bolivia might be organized such that the economic states  inputs  and outputs would be isomorphic to a person under some bizarre mapping from mental to economic variables             
Hilary Putnam              John Searle              and others                         have offered further arguments that functionalism is trivial  i e  that the internal structures functionalism tries to discuss turn out to be present everywhere  so that either functionalism turns out to reduce to behaviorism  or to complete triviality and therefore a form of panpsychism  These arguments typically use the assumption that physics leads to a progression of unique states  and that functionalist realization is present whenever there is a mapping from the proposed set of mental states to physical states of the system  Given that the states of a physical system are always at least slightly unique  such a mapping will always exist  so any system is a mind  Formulations of functionalism which stipulate absolute requirements on interaction with external objects  external to the functional account  meaning not defined functionally  are reduced to behaviorism instead of absolute triviality  because the input output behavior is still required 
Peter Godfrey Smith has argued further             that such formulations can still be reduced to triviality if they accept a somewhat innocent seeming additional assumption  The assumption is that adding a transducer layer  that is  an input output system  to an object should not change whether that object has mental states  The transducer layer is restricted to producing behavior according to a simple mapping  such as a lookup table  from inputs to actions on the system  and from the state of the system to outputs  However  since the system will be in unique states at each moment and at each possible input  such a mapping will always exist so there will be a transducer layer which will produce whatever physical behavior is desired 
Godfrey Smith believes that these problems can be addressed using causality  but that it may be necessary to posit a continuum between objects being minds and not being minds rather than an absolute distinction  Furthermore  constraining the mappings seems to require either consideration of the external behavior as in behaviorism  or discussion of the internal structure of the realization as in identity theory  and though multiple realizability does not seem to be lost  the functionalist claim of the autonomy of high level functional description becomes questionable
