Reporters with various forms of  fake news  from an      illustration by Frederick Burr Opper
Fake news or information disorder is false or misleading information  misinformation  disinformation  propaganda  and hoaxes  claiming the aesthetics and legitimacy of news             Fake news often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity             or making money through advertising revenue                        Although false news has always been spread throughout history  the term fake news was first used in the     s when sensational reports in newspapers were common                        Nevertheless  the term does not have a fixed definition and has been applied broadly to any type of false information presented as news  It has also been used by high profile people to apply to any news unfavorable to them  Further  disinformation involves spreading false information with harmful intent and is sometimes generated and propagated by hostile foreign actors  particularly during elections  In some definitions  fake news includes satirical articles misinterpreted as genuine  and articles that employ sensationalist or clickbait headlines that are not supported in the text             Because of this diversity of types of false news  researchers are beginning to favour information disorder as a more neutral and informative term      citation needed     
The prevalence of fake news has increased with the recent rise of social media             especially the Facebook News Feed  and this misinformation is gradually seeping into the mainstream media             Several factors have been implicated in the spread of fake news  such as political polarization  post truth politics  motivated reasoning  confirmation bias  and social media algorithms                                                           
Fake news can reduce the impact of real news by competing with it  For example  a BuzzFeed News analysis found that the top fake news stories about the      U S  presidential election received more engagement on Facebook than top stories from major media outlets              It also particularly has the potential to undermine trust in serious media coverage  The term has at times been used to cast doubt upon credible news  and U S  president Donald Trump has been credited with popularizing the term by using it to describe any negative press coverage of himself  It has been increasingly criticized  due in part to Trump s misuse  with the British government deciding to avoid the term  as it is  poorly defined  and  conflates a variety of false information  from genuine error through to foreign interference              
Multiple strategies for fighting fake news are actively researched  for various types of fake news  Politicians in certain autocratic and democratic countries have demanded effective self regulation and legally enforced regulation in varying forms  of social media and web search engines 
On an individual scale  the ability to actively confront false narratives  as well as taking care when sharing information can reduce the prevalence of falsified information  However  it has been noted that this is vulnerable to the effects of confirmation bias  motivated reasoning and other cognitive biases that can seriously distort reasoning  particularly in dysfunctional and polarised societies  Inoculation theory has been proposed as a method to render individuals resistant to undesirable narratives  Because new misinformation emerges frequently  researchers have stated that one solution to address this is to inoculate the population against accepting fake news in general  a process termed prebunking   instead of continually debunking the same repeated lies             


Defining fake news
Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news                          The term as it developed in      is a neologism  a new or re purposed expression that is entering the language  driven by culture or technology changes               Fake news is now used by many people as a catch all  referring to any lies and misrepresentations  from a news distributor or not  further  a few people use the term to condemn creditable news sources they do not like  without otherwise arguing details 
Fake news stories in the old sense  plus misleading headlines  are presented among other stories by news aggregators or political sites  for financial or political gain  There are also fake news websites which run only stories that have no basis in fact but are presented as being factually accurate              Some satirical sites openly label themselves as fake news or satire  or they may reveal that they are fake only on closer inspection for clues 
Overlapping terms are bullshit  hoax news  pseudo news  alternative facts  false news and junk news             
The National Endowment for Democracy defines fake news as   M isleading content found on the internet  especially on social media       Much of this content is produced by for profit websites and Facebook pages gaming the platform for advertising revenue  and distinguishes it from disinformation    F ake news does not meet the definition of disinformation or propaganda  Its motives are usually financial  not political  and it is usually not tied to a larger agenda              
While most definitions focus strictly on content accuracy and format  current research indicates that the rhetorical structure of the content might play a significant role in the perception of fake news             
Michael Radutzky  a producer of CBS    Minutes  said his show considers fake news to be  stories that are probably false  have enormous traction  popular appeal  in the culture  and are consumed by millions of people   These stories are not only found in politics  but also in areas like vaccination  stock values and nutrition              He did not include news that is  invoked by politicians against the media for stories that they don t like or for comments that they don t like  as fake news  Guy Campanile  also a    Minutes producer said   What we are talking about are stories that are fabricated out of thin air  By most measures  deliberately  and by any definition  that s a lie              
The intent and purpose of fake news is important  In some cases  fake news may be news satire  which uses exaggeration and introduces non factual elements that are intended to amuse or make a point  rather than to deceive                        
In the context of the United States of America and its election processes in the     s  fake news generated considerable controversy and argument  with some commentators defining concern over it as moral panic or mass hysteria and others worried about damage done to public trust                                      It particularly has the potential to undermine trust in serious media coverage generally              The term has also been used to cast doubt upon credible mainstream media                         
In January       the United Kingdom House of Commons commenced a parliamentary inquiry into the  growing phenomenon of fake news              
In       PolitiFact selected fake news as their Lie of the Year  No single lie stood out  so the generic term was chosen  Also in       Oxford Dictionaries selected post truth as its word of the year and defined it as the state of affairs when  objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief              

Roots
Main article  Media pluralism
The roots of  fake news  from UNESCO s World Trends Report            
The term fake news gained importance with the electoral context in Western Europe and North America  It is determined by fraudulent content in news format and its velocity              According to Bounegru  Gray  Venturini and Mauri  a lie becomes fake news when it  is picked up by dozens of other blogs  retransmitted by hundreds of websites  cross posted over thousands of social media accounts and read by hundreds of thousands              
The evolving nature of online business models encourages the production of information that is  click worthy  and independent of its accuracy             
The nature of trust depends on the assumptions that non institutional forms of communication are freer from power and more able to report information that mainstream media are perceived as unable or unwilling to reveal  Declines in confidence in much traditional media             and expert knowledge             have created fertile grounds for alternative  and often obscure sources of information to appear as authoritative and credible  This ultimately leaves users confused about basic facts             

Popularity and viral spread
Google Trends topic searches began a substantial increase in late       about the time of the U S  presidential election             
Fake news has become popular with various media outlets and platforms  Journalists have identified that the platforms like Google or Meta profit from the distribution of fake news                          Part of the reason behind the broad circulation of fake news online is that fake news websites can be profitable by monetizing them through online advertising            
Researchers at Pew Research Center discovered that over     of Americans access news through social media compared to traditional newspaper and magazines              With the popularity of social media  individuals can easily access fake news and disinformation  The rapid spread of false stories on social media during the      elections in Italy has been documented  as has diffusion of false stories on Facebook during the      US election campaign             
Fake news has the tendency to become viral among the public  With the presence of social media platforms like Twitter  it becomes easier for false information to diffuse quickly  Research has found that false political information tends to spread three times faster than other false news              On Twitter  false tweets have a much higher chance of being retweeted than truthful tweets  More so  it is humans who are responsible for disseminating false news and information as opposed to bots and click farms  The tendency for humans to spread false information has to do with human behavior  according to research  humans are attracted to events and information that are surprising and new  and  as a result  cause high arousal in the brain                          Besides  motivated reasoning was found to play a role in the spread of fake news              This ultimately leads humans to retweet or share false information  which are usually characterized with clickbait and eye catching titles  This prevents people from stopping to verify the information  As a result  massive online communities form around a piece of false news without any prior fact checking or verification of the veracity of the information 
Of particular concern regarding viral spread of fake news is the role of super spreaders  Brian Stelter  the anchor of Reliable Sources at CNN  has documented the systematic long term two way feedback that developed between President Donald Trump and Fox News presenters  The resultant conditioning of outrage in their large audience against government and the mainstream media has proved a highly successful money spinner for the TV network             

Its damaging effects
In       the inventor of the World Wide Web  Tim Berners Lee claimed that fake news was one of the three most significant new disturbing Internet trends that must first be resolved if the Internet is to be capable of truly  serving humanity   The other two new disturbing trends were the recent surge in the use of the Internet by governments for citizen surveillance purposes  and for cyberwarfare purposes             
Author Terry Pratchett  previously a journalist and press officer  was among the first to be concerned about the spread of fake news on the Internet  In a      interview with Bill Gates  founder of Microsoft  he said   Let s say I call myself the Institute for Something or other and I decide to promote a spurious treatise saying the Jews were entirely responsible for the Second World War  and the Holocaust didn t happen  and it goes out there on the Internet and is available on the same terms as any piece of historical research which has undergone peer review and so on  There s a kind of parity of esteem of information on the net  It s all there  there s no way of finding out whether this stuff has any bottom to it or whether someone has just made it up   Gates was optimistic and disagreed  saying that authorities on the Internet would index and check facts and reputations in a much more sophisticated way than in print  But it was Pratchett who more accurately predicted how the Internet would propagate and legitimize fake news             
When the Internet first became accessible for public use in the     s  its main purpose was for the seeking and accessing of information              As fake news was introduced to the Internet  this made it difficult for some people to find truthful information  The impact of fake news has become a worldwide phenomenon              Fake news is often spread through the use of fake news websites  which  in order to gain credibility  specialize in creating attention grabbing news  which often impersonate well known news sources                                      Jestin Coler  who said he does it for  fun               has indicated that he earned US        per month from advertising on his fake news websites             
Research has shown that fake news hurts social media and online based outlets far worse than traditional print and TV outlets  After a survey was conducted  it was found that     of people had less trust in social media news stories as opposed to     of people in mainstream media after learning about fake news              In      Christine Michel Carter  a writer who has reported on Generation Alpha for Forbes stated that one third of the generation can decipher false or misleading information in the media             

Types of fake news
Claire Wardle of First Draft News  has identified seven types of fake news             

Manipulated content  an intentionally deceptive photoshopped image of Hillary Clinton over a      photo of Peoples Temple cult leader Jim Jones
satire or parody   no intention to cause harm but has potential to fool  
false connection   when headlines  visuals or captions don t support the content  
misleading content   misleading use of information to frame an issue or an individual  
false context   when genuine content is shared with false contextual information  
impostor content   when genuine sources are impersonated  with false  made up sources 
manipulated content   when genuine information or imagery is manipulated to deceive   as with a  doctored  photo 
fabricated content   new content is      false  designed to deceive and do harm  
Scientific denialism is another potential explanatory type of fake news  defined as the act of producing false or misleading facts to unconsciously support strong pre existing beliefs             

Criticism of the term
In       Wardle announced she has now rejected the phrase fake news and  censors it in conversation   finding it  woefully inadequate  to describe the issues  She now speaks of information disorder and information pollution  and distinguishes between three overarching types of information content problems             

Mis information  misinformation   false information disseminated without harmful intent 
Dis information  disinformation   false information created and shared by people with harmful intent 
Mal information  malinformation   the sharing of  genuine  information with the intent to cause harm 
Disinformation attacks are the most insidious type because of the harmful intent  For example  it is sometimes generated and propagated by hostile foreign actors  particularly during elections                         
Because of the manner in which former president Donald Trump has co opted the term  The Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan has warned fellow journalists that  It s time to retire the tainted term  fake news   Though the term hasn t been around long  its meaning already is lost               By late       the term  fake news  had become verboten and U S  journalists  including the Poynter Institute were asking for apologies and for product retirements from companies using the term                                     
In October       the British government decided that the term fake news will no longer be used in official documents because it is  a poorly defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information  from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes   This followed a recommendation by the House of Commons  Digital  Culture  Media and Sport Committee to avoid the term             
However  recent reviews of fake news still regard it as a useful broad construct  equivalent in meaning to fabricated news  as separate from related types of problematic news content  such as hyperpartisan news  the latter being a particular source of political polarization                          Therefore  researchers are beginning to favour information disorder as a more neutral and informative term  For example  the Commission of Inquiry by the Aspen Institute        has adopted the term Information Disorder in its investigative report             

Identification

According to an academic library guide  a number of specific aspects of fake news may help to identify it and thus avoid being unduly influenced              These include  clickbait  propaganda  satire parody  sloppy journalism  misleading headings  manipulation  rumor mill  misinformation  media bias  audience bias  and content farms 
The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions  IFLA  published a summary in diagram form  pictured at right  to assist people in recognizing fake news              Its main points are 

Consider the source  to understand its mission and purpose 
Read beyond the headline  to understand the whole story 
Check the authors  to see if they are real and credible 
Assess the supporting sources  to ensure they support the claims 
Check the date of publication  to see if the story is relevant and up to date 
Ask if it is a joke  to determine if it is meant to be satire 
Review your own biases  to see if they are affecting your judgment 
Ask experts  to get confirmation from independent people with knowledge              
The International Fact Checking Network  IFCN   launched by the Poynter Institute in       supports international collaborative efforts in fact checking  provides training  and has published a code of principles              In      it introduced an application and vetting process for journalistic organisations              One of IFCN s verified signatories  the independent  not for profit media journal The Conversation  created a short animation explaining its fact checking process  which involves  extra checks and balances  including blind peer review by a second academic expert  additional scrutiny and editorial oversight              
Beginning in the      school year  children in Taiwan study a new curriculum designed to teach critical reading of propaganda and the evaluation of sources  Called  media literacy   the course provides training in journalism in the new information society             

Online identification
Fake news has become increasingly prevalent over the last few years  with over     misleading articles and rumors spread regarding the      United States presidential election alone              These fake news articles tend to come from satirical news websites or individual websites with an incentive to propagate false information  either as clickbait or to serve a purpose              Since they typically hope to intentionally promote incorrect information  such articles are quite difficult to detect             
When identifying a source of information  one must look at many attributes  including but not limited to the content of the email and social media engagements  Specifically  the language is typically more inflammatory in fake news than real articles  in part because the purpose is to confuse and generate clicks             
Furthermore  modeling techniques such as n gram encodings and bag of words have served as other linguistic techniques to determine the legitimacy of a news source              On top of that  researchers have determined that visual based cues also play a factor in categorizing an article  specifically some features can be designed to assess if a picture was legitimate and provides more clarity on the news              There are also many social context features that can play a role  as well as the model for spreading the news  Websites such as Snopes try to detect this information manually  while certain universities are trying to build mathematical models to do this themselves             

Tackling and suppression strategies
Considerable research is underway regarding strategies for confronting and suppressing fake news of all types  in particular disinformation  which is the deliberate spreading of false narratives for political purposes  or for destabilising social cohesion in targeted communities  Multiple strategies need to be tailored to individual types of fake news  depending for example on whether the fake news is deliberately produced  or rather unintentionally or unconsciously produced 
Considerable resources are available to combat fake news  Regular summaries of current events and research are available on the websites and email newsletters of a number of support organisations  Particularly notable are the First Draft Archive              the Information Futures Lab  School of Public Health  Brown University             and the Nieman Foundation for Journalism  Harvard University              
Journalist Bernard Keane  in his book on misinformation in Australia  classifies strategies for dealing with fake news into three categories      the liar  the perpetrator of fake news       the conduit  the method of carriage of the fake news   and     the lied to  the recipient of the fake news              

Strategies regarding the perpetrator
Promotion of facts over emotions
American philosopher of science Lee McIntyre  who has researched the scientific attitude and post truth  has explained the importance of factual basis of society  in preference to one in which emotions replace facts  One modern example is the symbiotic relationship that developed between President Donald Trump and Fox News  in which the conspiracy beliefs of Fox hosts were repeated shortly after by Trump  and vice versa  in a continuous feedback loop  This served to promote outrage  and thus to condition and radicalise conservative Republican Fox listeners into cult like Trump supporters  and to demonise and gaslight Democratic opponents  the mainstream media  and elites generally             
A key strategy to counter fake news based on emotions rather than facts is to flood the information space  particularly social media and web browser search results with factual news  thus drowning out misinformation              A key factor in establishing facts is the role of critical thinking  the principles of which should be imbedded more comprehensively within all school and university education courses              Critical thinking is a style of thinking in which citizens  prior to subsequent problem solving and decision making  have learned to pay attention to the content of written words  and to judge their accuracy and fairness  among other worthy attributes 

Technique rebuttal
Because content rebuttal  presenting true facts to refute false information  does not always work  Lee McIntyre suggests the better method of technique rebuttal  in which faulty reasoning by deniers is exposed  such as cherry picking data  and relying too much on fake experts  Deniers have a lot of information  but a deficit of trust in mainstream sources  McIntyre first builds trust by respectful exchange  listening carefully to their explanation without interrupting  Then he asks questions such as  What evidence would make you change your mind   and  Why do you trust that source   McIntyre has used his technique to talk to flat earthers  though he admits it may not work with hard core deniers             

Individual counteraction
Individuals should confront misinformation when spotted in online blogs  even if briefly  otherwise they fester and proliferate  The person being responded to is probably resistant to change  but many other bloggers may read and learn from an evidence based reply              A brutal example was learned by John Kerry during the US      Presidential election campaign against George W  Bush  The right wing Swift Boat Veterans for Truth falsely claimed that Kerry showed cowardice during the Vietnam War  Kerry refused to dignify the claims with a response for two weeks  despite being pummeled in the media  and this action contributed to his marginal loss to Bush  We should never assume any claim is too outrageous to be believed                                       
However  caution applies regarding over zealous debunking of fake news  It is often unwise to draw attention to fake news published on a low impact website or blog  one that has few followers   If this fake news is debunked by a journalist in a high profile place such as The New York Times  knowledge of the false claim spreads widely  and more people overall will end up believing it  ignoring or denying the debunk      a     

Backfire effect
A widely reported paper by Brendan Nyhan and Jason Riefler in      found that when persons with a firm belief are presented with corrective information  their mistaken political beliefs were reinforced rather than reduced in two of their five studies  The researchers called this a backfire effect              However  this finding was widely misreported as that corrective information was the sole cause of reinforced misinformation  Later studies  including by Nyhan and colleagues  failed to support a backfire effect  Instead  Nyhan now accepts that the reinforced beliefs are largely controlled by cues from high profile elites and media that spread misinformation             

Strategies regarding carriers
Regulation of social media
Internet companies with threatened credibility have developed new responses to limit fake news and reduce financial incentives for its proliferation                         
A valid criticism of social media companies is that users are presented with content that they will like  based on previous viewing preferences  An undesirable side effect is that confirmation bias is enhanced in users  which in turn enhances the acceptance of fake news  To reduce this bias  effective self regulation and legally enforced regulation of social media  notably Facebook and Twitter  and web search engines  notably Google  need to become more effective and innovative             
Financial disincentives to tackle fake news also apply to some mainstream media  Brian Stelter  the anchor of Reliable Sources at CNN  has provided a substantial critique of the symbiotic but damaging relationship that developed between President Donald Trump and Fox News  which has proved an extraordinarily successful money spinner for the Murdoch owned TV network  despite it being a super spreader of fake news             

General strategy
The general approach by these tech companies is the detection of problematic news via human fact checking and automated artificial intelligence  machine learning  natural language processing and network analysis   Tech companies have utilized two basic counter strategies  down ranking fake news and warning messages             
In the first approach  problematic content is down ranked by the search algorithm  for example  to the second or later pages on a Google search  so that users are less likely to see it  most users just scan the first page of search results   However  two problems arise  One is that truth is not black and white  and fact checkers often disagree on how to classify the content included in computer training sets  running the risk of false positives and unjustified censorship  Also  fake news often evolves rapidly  and therefore identifiers of misinformation may be ineffective in the future             
The second approach involves attaching warnings to content that professional fact checkers have found to be false  Much evidence indicates that corrections and warnings do produce reduced misperceptions and sharing  Despite some early evidence that fact checking could backfire  recent research has shown that these backfire effects are extremely uncommon  But an important problem is that professional fact checking is not scalable it can take substantial time and effort to investigate each particular claim  Thus  many  if not most  false claims never get fact checked  Also  the process is slow  and a warning may miss the period of peak viral spreading  Further  warnings are typically only attached to blatantly false news  rather than to biased coverage of events that actually occurred             
A third approach is to place more emphasis on reliable sources such as Wikipedia  as well as mainstream media  for example  The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal   and science communication publications  for example  Scientific American and The Conversation   However  this approach has led to mixed results  as hyperpartisan commentary and confirmation bias is found even in these sources  the media has both news and opinion pages   In addition  some sections of the community completely reject scientific commentary             
A fourth approach is to ban or specifically target so called super spreaders of fake news from social media             

Fact checking
During the      United States presidential election  the creation and coverage of fake news increased substantially              This resulted in a widespread response to combat the spread of fake news                                      The volume and reluctance of fake news websites to respond to fact checking organizations has posed a problem to inhibiting the spread of fake news through fact checking alone              In an effort to reduce the effects of fake news  fact checking websites  including Snopes com and FactCheck org  have posted guides to spotting and avoiding fake news websites                          Social media sites and search engines  such as Facebook and Google  received criticism for facilitating the spread of fake news  Both of these corporations have taken measures to explicitly prevent the spread of fake news  critics  however  believe more action is needed             

Facebook
After the      American election and the run up to the German election  Facebook began labeling and warning of inaccurate news                         and partnered with independent fact checkers to label inaccurate news  warning readers before sharing it                          After a story is flagged as disputed  it will be reviewed by the third party fact checkers  Then  if it has been proven to be a fake news story  the post cannot be turned into an ad or promoted              Artificial intelligence is one of the more recent technologies being developed in the United States and Europe to recognize and eliminate fake news through algorithms              In       Facebook targeted        accounts related to the spread of misinformation regarding the French presidential election             
In       during the COVID    pandemic  Facebook found that troll farms from North Macedonia and the Philippines pushed coronavirus disinformation  The publishers that used contents from these farms were banned from the platform             

Google
In March       Google launched Google News Initiative  GNI  to fight the spread of fake news  It launched GNI under the belief that quality journalism and identifying truth online is crucial  GNI has three goals   to elevate and strengthen quality journalism  evolve business models to drive sustainable growth and empower news organizations through technological innovation               To achieve the first goal  Google created the Disinfo Lab  which combats the spread of fake news during crucial times such as elections or breaking news  The company is also working to adjust its systems to display more trustworthy content during times of breaking news  To make it easier for users to subscribe to media publishers  Google created Subscribe with Google  Additionally  they have created a dashboard  News Consumer Insights that allows news organizations to better understand their audiences using data and analytics  Google was to spend      million through      on these efforts  among others  to combat fake news             
In November       YouTube  owned by Google  suspended news outlet One America News Network  OANN  for a week for spreading misinformation on coronavirus  The outlet has violated YouTube s policy multiple times  A video that falsely promoted a guaranteed cure to the virus has been deleted from the channel              

Legal and criminal sanctions in general
The use of anonymously hosted fake news websites has made it difficult to prosecute sources of fake news for libel                          
Numerous countries have created laws in an attempt to regulate or prosecute harmful misinformation more generally than just with a focus on tech companies  In numerous countries  people have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID    pandemic      b     
Algerian lawmakers passed a law criminalising  fake news  deemed harmful to  public order and state security                The Turkish Interior Ministry has been arresting social media users whose posts were  targeting officials and spreading panic and fear by suggesting the virus had spread widely in Turkey and that officials had taken insufficient measures                Iran s military said      people have been arrested for  spreading rumors  about COVID    in the country               In Cambodia  some individuals who expressed concerns about the spread of COVID    have been arrested on fake news charges                            The United Arab Emirates have introduced criminal penalties for the spread of misinformation and rumours related to the outbreak              

Strategies regarding the recipient
Cognitive biases of recipient
The vast proliferation of online information  such as in blogs and tweets  has inundated the online marketplace  Because of the resulting information overload  humans cannot process all these information units  called memes   so confirmation bias and other cognitive biases decide which ones to pay attention to  thus enhancing the spread of fake news  Moreover  these cognitive vulnerabilities are easily exploited by both computer algorithms that present information one may like  based on previous social media use  and by individual manipulators who create social media bots to deliberately spread disinformation              
A recent study by Randy Stein and colleagues shows that conservatives value personal stories  non scientific  intuitive or experiential evidence  more than do liberals  progressives   and therefore perhaps may be less swayed by scientific evidence  This study  however  only tested responses to apolitical messages                           

Nudges as reflection prompts
People tend to react hastily and share fake news without thinking carefully about what they have read or heard  and without checking or verifying the information   Nudging  people to consider the accuracy of incoming information has been shown to prompt people to think about it  to improve the accuracy of their judgement  and to reduce the likelihood that incorrect information is unreflectively shared                                                      An example of a technology based nudge is Twitter s  read before you retweet  prompt  which prompts readers to read an article and consider its contents before retweeting it              

Media literacy
Critical media literacy skills  for both printed and digital media  help readers self evaluate the accuracy of the media content  Nolan Higdon argues that a critical media literacy education focused on teaching critical thinking about how to detect fake news is the most effective method to mitigate the influence of propaganda              


Mental immune health  inoculation and prebunking
American philosopher Andy Norman  in his book Mental Immunity  argues for a new science of cognitive immunology as a practical guide to resisting bad ideas  such as conspiracy theories   as well as transcending petty tribalism  He argues that reasoned argument  the scientific method  fact checking and critical thinking skills alone are insufficient to counter the broad scope of false information  Overlooked is the power of confirmation bias  motivated reasoning  and other cognitive biases that can seriously distort the many facets of mental  immunity   public resilience to fake news   particularly in dysfunctional societies              
One problem identified by Susan A  Nolan  Ph D   and Michael Kimball  writing for Psychology Today  is that new misinformation  including intentional disinformation  is constantly emerging  The pair cited research suggesting that this could be addressed by inoculating the population against misinformation  rather than to continually having to debunk each new claim at a later time  explaining that this inoculation builds public resilience and creates the conditions for psychological  herd immunity   The general term for this process is prebunking  defined as the process of debunking lies  tactics or sources before they strike  The research they cited included studies of free online games shown to provide tools to fight fake news  leading to healthy skepticism when consuming news              As of          update       Google implemented novel prebunking video adverts  which have been shown to be effective in countering misinformation during trials in Eastern Europe              
Most current research is based on inoculation theory  a social psychological and communication theory that explains how an attitude or belief can be protected against persuasion or influence in much the same way a body can be protected against disease for example  through pre exposure to weakened versions of a stronger  future threat  The theory uses inoculation as its explanatory analogy applied to attitudes  or beliefs  much like a vaccine is applied to an infectious disease  It has great potential for building public resilience   immunity   against misinformation and fake news  for example  in tackling science denialism  risky health behaviours  and emotionally manipulative marketing and political messaging                                                     
For example  John Cook and colleagues have shown that inoculation theory shows promise in countering climate change denialism  This involves a two step process  Firstly  the    or so most common myths about climate change are listed and deconstructed by identifying the reasoning errors and logical fallacies of each one  Secondly  the concept of parallel argumentation is used to explain the flaw in the argument by transplanting the same logic into a parallel situation  often an extreme or absurd one  Adding appropriate humour can be particularly effective                                        

History
Ancient
Roman politician and general Mark Antony killed himself because of misinformation              
In the   th century BC  Ramesses the Great spread lies and propaganda portraying the Battle of Kadesh as a stunning victory for the Egyptians  he depicted scenes of himself smiting his foes during the battle on the walls of nearly all his temples  The treaty between the Egyptians and the Hittites  however  reveals that the battle was actually a stalemate              
During the first century BC  Octavian ran a campaign of misinformation against his rival Mark Antony  portraying him as a drunkard  a womanizer  and a mere puppet of the Egyptian queen Cleopatra VII               He published a document purporting to be Mark Antony s will  which claimed that Mark Antony  upon his death  wished to be entombed in the mausoleum of the Ptolemaic pharaohs  Although the document may have been forged  it invoked outrage from the Roman populace               Mark Antony ultimately killed himself after his defeat in the Battle of Actium upon hearing false rumors propagated by Cleopatra herself claiming that she had committed suicide              
During the second and third centuries AD  false rumors were spread about Christians claiming that they engaged in ritual cannibalism and incest                            In the late third century AD  the Christian apologist Lactantius invented and exaggerated stories about pagans engaging in acts of immorality and cruelty               while the anti Christian writer Porphyry invented similar stories about Christians              

Medieval
In       a fake news story in Trent claimed that the Jewish community had murdered a two and a half year old Christian infant named Simonino             The story resulted in all the Jews in the city being arrested and tortured     of them were burned at the stake             Pope Sixtus IV himself attempted to stamp out the story  however  by that point  it had already spread beyond anyone s control             Stories of this kind were known as  blood libel   they claimed that Jews purposely killed Christians  especially Christian children  and used their blood for religious or ritual purposes              

Early modern
After the invention of the printing press in       publications became widespread but there was no standard of journalistic ethics to follow  By the   th century  historians began the practice of citing their sources in footnotes  In      when Galileo went on trial  the demand for verifiable news increased            
During the   th century publishers of fake news were fined and banned in the Netherlands  one man  Gerard Lodewijk van der Macht  was banned four times by Dutch authorities and four times he moved and restarted his press               In the American colonies  Benjamin Franklin wrote fake news about murderous  scalping  Indians working with King George III in an effort to sway public opinion in favor of the American Revolution            
Canards  the successors of the   th century pasquinade  were sold in Paris on the street for two centuries  starting in the   th century  In       Marie Antoinette was executed in part because of popular hatred engendered by a canard on which her face had been printed              
During the era of slave owning in the United States  supporters of slavery propagated fake news stories about African Americans  whom white people considered to have lower status               Violence occurred in reaction to the spread of some fake news events  In one instance  stories of African Americans spontaneously turning white spread through the south and struck fear into the hearts of many people            
Rumors and anxieties about slave rebellions were common in Virginia from the beginning of the colonial period  despite the only major uprising occurring in the   th century  One particular instance of fake news regarding revolts occurred in       The serving governor of Virginia at the time  Governor William Gooch  reported that a slave rebellion had occurred but was effectively put down although this never happened  After Gooch discovered the falsehood  he ordered slaves found off plantations to be punished  tortured and made prisoners              

  th century

From      to       James Cheetham made use of fictional stories to advocate politically against Aaron Burr                            His stories were often defamatory and he was frequently sued for libel                                        
One instance of fake news was the Great Moon Hoax of       The Sun newspaper of New York published articles about a real life astronomer and a made up colleague who  according to the hoax  had observed bizarre life on the Moon  The fictionalized articles successfully attracted new subscribers  and the penny paper suffered very little backlash after it admitted the next month that the series had been a hoax                          Such stories were intended to entertain readers and not to mislead them              
Yellow journalism peaked in the mid     s characterizing the sensationalist journalism that arose in the circulation war between Joseph Pulitzer s New York World and William Randolph Hearst s New York Journal  Pulitzer and other yellow journalism publishers goaded the United States into the Spanish American War  which was precipitated when the USS      Maine exploded in the harbor of Havana  Cuba               The term fake news itself was apparently first used in the     s during this era of sensationalist news reporting

  th century
Fake news became popular and spread quickly in the     s  Media like newspapers  articles  and magazines were in high demand because of technology               Author Sarah Churchwell shows that when The New York Times reprinted the      speech by Woodrow Wilson that popularized the phrase America First  they also used the subheading  Fake News Condemned  to describe a section of his speech warning against propaganda and misinformation  although Wilson himself had not used the phrase fake news  In his speech  Wilson warned of a growing problem with news that  turn s  out to be falsehood   warning the country it  could not afford  to let the rumors of irresponsible persons and origins get into the United States   as that would undermine democracy and the principle of a free and accurate press               
Following a claim by CNN that  Trump was    the first US President to deploy  the term  fake news   against his opponents                Sarah Churchwell s work was cited to claim that  it was Woodrow Wilson who popularized the phrase  fake news  in       without reference               forcing her to counter this claim  saying that  the phrase  fake news  was very much NOT popularized  or even used  by Wilson  The NY Times used it in passing but it didn t catch on  Trump was the first to popularize it               

Residents of New York City celebrate the news of the Armistice of    November      
During the First World War  an example of fake news was the anti German atrocity propaganda regarding an alleged  German Corpse Factory  in which the German battlefield dead were supposedly rendered down for fats used to make nitroglycerine  candles  lubricants  human soap and boot dubbing  Unfounded rumors regarding such a factory circulated in the Allied press starting in       and by      the English language publication North China Daily News presented these allegations as true at a time when Britain was trying to convince China to join the Allied war effort  this was based on new  allegedly true stories from The Times and the Daily Mail that turned out to be forgeries  
These false allegations became known as such after the war  and in the Second World War Joseph Goebbels used the story in order to deny the ongoing massacre of Jews as British propaganda  According to Joachim Neander and Randal Marlin  the story also  encouraged later disbelief  when reports about the Holocaust surfaced after the liberation of Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps              
After Hitler and the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany in       they established the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda under the control of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels               The Nazis used both print and broadcast journalism to promote their agendas  either by obtaining ownership of those media or exerting political influence               The expression big lie  German  gro e L ge  was coined by Adolf Hitler  when he dictated his      book Mein Kampf  Throughout World War II  both the Axis and the Allies employed fake news in the form of propaganda to persuade the public at home and in enemy countries                            The British Political Warfare Executive used radio broadcasts and distributed leaflets to discourage German troops              
The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace claimed that The New York Times printed fake news  depicting Russia as a socialist paradise                During            The New York Times published numerous articles by its Moscow bureau chief  Walter Duranty  who won a Pulitzer Prize for a series of reports about the Soviet Union 

  st century
Deep fakes
In the   st century  both the impact of fake news and the use of the term became widespread                          
The increasing openness  access and prevalence of the Internet resulted in its growth  New information and stories are published constantly and at a faster rate than ever  often lacking in verification  which may be consumed by anyone with an Internet connection                           Fake news has grown from being sent via emails to attacking social media              Besides referring to made up stories designed to deceive readers into clicking on links  maximizing traffic and profit  the term has also referred to satirical news  whose purpose is not to mislead but rather to inform viewers and share humorous commentary about real news and the mainstream media                            United States examples of satire include the newspaper The Onion  Saturday Night Live     s Weekend Update  and the television shows The Daily Show  The Colbert Report  The Late Show with Stephen Colbert                                        
  st century fake news is often intended to increase the financial profits of the news outlet  In an interview with NPR  Jestin Coler  former CEO of the fake media conglomerate Disinfomedia  told who writes fake news articles  who funds these articles  and why fake news creators create and distribute false information  Coler  who has since left his role as a fake news creator  said that his company employed    to    writers at a time and made         to         monthly from advertisements  Coler began his career in journalism as a magazine salesman before working as a freelance writer  He said he entered the fake news industry to prove to himself and others just how rapidly fake news can spread               
Disinfomedia is not the only outlet responsible for the distribution of fake news  Facebook users play a major role in feeding into fake news stories by making sensationalized stories  trend   according to BuzzFeed media editor Craig Silverman  and the individuals behind Google AdSense basically fund fake news websites and their content               Mark Zuckerberg  CEO of Facebook  said   I think the idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election in any way  I think is a pretty crazy idea  and then a few days later he blogged that Facebook was looking for ways to flag fake news stories              
Many online pro Trump fake news stories have been sourced out of Veles  Macedonia  where approximately seven different fake news organizations employ hundreds of teenagers to rapidly produce and plagiarize sensationalist stories for different U S  based companies and parties              
Kim LaCapria of the fact checking website Snopes com has stated that  in America  fake news is a bipartisan phenomenon  saying that   t here has always been a sincerely held yet erroneous belief misinformation is more red than blue in America  and that has never been true                Jeff Green of Trade Desk agrees the phenomenon affects both sides  Green s company found that affluent and well educated persons in their   s and   s are the primary consumers of fake news  He told Scott Pelley of    Minutes that this audience tends to live in an  echo chamber  and that these are the people who vote             
In       the Russian Government used disinformation via networks such as RT to create a counter narrative after Russian backed Ukrainian rebels shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight                  In       NATO claimed it had seen a significant rise in Russian propaganda and fake news stories since the invasion of Crimea in                    Fake news stories originating from Russian government officials were also circulated internationally by Reuters news agency and published in the most popular news websites in the United States              
A      study at Oxford University found that Trump s supporters consumed the  largest volume of  junk news  on Facebook and Twitter               

On Twitter  a network of Trump supporters consumes the largest volume of junk news  and junk news is the largest proportion of news links they share   the researchers concluded  On Facebook  the skew was even greater  There   extreme hard right pages distinct from Republican pages share more junk news than all the other audiences put together              
In                    researchers from Princeton University  Dartmouth College and the University of Exeter examined the consumption of fake news during the      U S  presidential campaign  Their findings showed that Trump supporters and older Americans  over     were far more likely to consume fake news than Clinton supporters  Those most likely to visit fake news websites were the     of Americans who consumed the most conservative information  There was a very large difference        in the consumption of fake news stories as related to total news consumption between Trump supporters      and Clinton supporters                                
The study also showed that fake pro Trump and fake pro Clinton news stories were read by their supporters  but with a significant difference  Trump supporters consumed far more       than Clinton supporters        Facebook was by far the key  gateway  website where these fake stories were spread and which led people to then go to the fake news websites  Fact checks of fake news were rarely seen by consumers                            with none of those who saw a fake news story being reached by a related fact check              
Brendan Nyhan  one of the researchers  emphatically stated in an interview on NBC News   People got vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites full stop               

NBC NEWS   It feels like there s a connection between having an active portion of a party that s prone to seeking false stories and conspiracies and a president who has famously spread conspiracies and false claims  In many ways  demographically and ideologically  the president fits the profile of the fake news users that you re describing  NYHAN   It s worrisome if fake news websites further weaken the norm against false and misleading information in our politics  which unfortunately has eroded  But it s also important to put the content provided by fake news websites in perspective  People got vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites full stop               
A      study by researchers at Princeton and New York University found that a person s likelihood of sharing fake news articles correlated more strongly with age than it did education  sex  or political views      of users older than    shared an article consistent with the study s definition of fake news  Just    of users ages    to    did the same              
Another issue in mainstream media is the usage of the filter bubble  a  bubble  that has been created that gives the viewer  on social media platforms  a specific piece of the information knowing they will like it  Thus creating fake news and biased news because only half the story is being shared  the portion the viewer liked   In       Nicolas Negroponte predicted a world where information technologies become increasingly customizable

Deepfakes and shallowfakes
See also  Deepfakes
Deepfakes  a portmanteau of deep learning and fake  are synthetic media  AI generated media               in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else s likeness              
Because a picture often has a greater impact than the corresponding words  deepfakes which leverage powerful techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence to manipulate or generate visual and audio content have a particularly high potential to deceive               The main machine learning methods used to create deepfakes are based on deep learning and involve training generative neural network architectures  such as autoencoders              or generative adversarial networks  GANs               
Deepfakes have garnered widespread attention for their uses in creating fake news  notably political   but also child sexual abuse material  celebrity pornographic videos  revenge porn  hoaxes  bullying  and financial fraud                                         This has elicited responses from both industry and government to detect and limit their use                           
Deepfakes generally require specialist software or knowledge  but much the same effect can be achieved quickly by anyone using standard video editing software on most modern computers  These videos  termed shallowfakes  have obvious flaws  but nevertheless can still be widely believed as real  or at least have entertainment value that reinforces beliefs  One of the first to go viral   The Hillary Song   watched over   million times  shows Hillary Clinton being humiliated on stage by The Rock  a former wrestling champion  The surprised creator  who hates all politicians   pasted images of Clinton into a genuine video of The Rock humiliating a wrestling official              

Bots on social media
In the mid     s  Nicolas Negroponte anticipated a world where news through technology become progressively personalized  In his      book      Being Digital      he predicted a digital life where news consumption becomes an extremely personalized experience and newspapers adapted content to reader preferences  This prediction has since been reflected in modern day news and social media feeds              
Bots have the potential to increase the spread of fake news  as they use algorithms to decide what articles and information specific users like  without taking into account the authenticity of an article  Bots mass produce and spread articles  regardless of the credibility of the sources  allowing them to play an essential role in the mass spread of fake news  as bots are capable of creating fake accounts and personalities on the web that are then gaining followers  recognition  and authority  Additionally  almost     of the spam and content spread on the Internet originates from these software bots              
In the   st century  the capacity to mislead was enhanced by the widespread use of social media  For example  one   st century website that enabled fake news  proliferation was the Facebook newsfeed                            In late      fake news gained notoriety following the uptick in news content by this means  and its prevalence on the micro blogging site Twitter                         In the United States      of Americans use social media to receive news              Many people use their Facebook News Feed to get news  despite Facebook not being considered a news site               According to Craig McClain  over     of Facebook users obtain news from the site               This  in combination with increased political polarization and filter bubbles  led to a tendency for readers to mainly read headlines              
Numerous individuals and news outlets have stated that fake news may have influenced the outcome of the      American Presidential Election                            Fake news saw higher sharing on Facebook than legitimate news stories                                                     which analysts explained was because fake news often panders to expectations or is otherwise more exciting than legitimate news                            Facebook itself initially denied this characterization                            A Pew Research poll conducted in December      found that     of U S  adults believed completely made up news had caused  a great deal of confusion  about the basic facts of current events  while     claimed it had caused  some confusion  and     said it had caused  not much or no confusion               Additionally      of those polled admitted they had personally shared fake news  whether knowingly or not  Researchers from Stanford assessed that only    of readers of fake news recalled and believed in the content they were reading  though the same share of readers also recalled and believed in  placebos  stories they did not actually read  but that were produced by the authors of the study  In comparison  over     of the participants recalled reading and believed in true news stories             
By August      Facebook stopped using the term fake news and used false news in its place instead  Will Oremus of Slate wrote that because supporters of U S  President Donald Trump had redefined the word fake news to refer to mainstream media opposed to them   it makes sense for Facebook and others to cede the term to the right wing trolls who have claimed it as their own               
Research from Northwestern University concluded that     of all fake news traffic  as opposed to only    of real news traffic  could be linked back to Facebook  The research concluded fake news consumers do not exist in a filter bubble  many of them also consume real news from established news sources  The fake news audience is only    percent of the real news audience  and most fake news consumers spent a relatively similar amount of time on fake news compared with real news consumers with the exception of Drudge Report readers  who spent more than    times longer reading the website than other users              
In the wake of western events  China s Ren Xianling of the Cyberspace Administration of China suggested a  reward and punish  system be implemented to avoid fake news              

Internet trolls
See also  Internet trolls
In Internet slang  a troll is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people  by posting inflammatory  extraneous  or off topic messages in an online community  such as a newsgroup  forum  chat room  or blog  with the intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or off topic discussion  often for the troll s amusement  Internet trolls also feed on attention              
The idea of Internet trolls gained popularity in the     s  though its meaning shifted in       Whereas it once denoted provocation  it is a term now widely used to signify the abuse and misuse of the Internet  Trolling comes in various forms  and can be dissected into abuse trolling  entertainment trolling  classical trolling  flame trolling  anonymous trolling  and kudos trolling  It is closely linked to fake news  as Internet trolls are now largely interpreted as perpetrators of false information  information that can often be passed along unwittingly by reporters and the public alike                           
When interacting with each other  trolls often share misleading information that contributes to the fake news circulated on sites like Twitter and Facebook               In the      American election  Russia paid over       Internet trolls to circulate fake news and disinformation about Hillary Clinton  they also created social media accounts that resembled voters in important swing states  spreading influential political standpoints                            In February       Glenn Greenwald wrote that cybersecurity company New Knowledge  was caught just six weeks ago engaging in a massive scam to create fictitious Russian troll accounts on Facebook and Twitter in order to claim that the Kremlin was working to defeat Democratic Senate nominee Doug Jones in Alabama               

Fake news hoaxes
Paul Horner is perhaps the best known example of a person who deliberately creates fake news for a purpose  He has been referred to as a  hoax artist  by the Associated Press and the Chicago Tribune               The Huffington Post called Horner a  performance artist               
Horner was behind several widespread hoaxes such as      that the graffiti artist Banksy had been arrested                            and     that he had an  enormous impact  on the      U S  presidential election  according to CBS News               These stories consistently appeared in Google s top news search results  were shared widely on Facebook  were taken seriously and shared by third parties such as Trump presidential campaign manager Corey Lewandowski  Eric Trump  ABC News and the Fox News Channel                                         Horner later claimed that the intention was  to make Trump s supporters look like idiots for sharing my stories               

In a November      interview with The Washington Post  Horner expressed regret for the role his fake news stories played in the election and surprise at how gullible people were in treating his stories as news                                                      In February      Horner said  I truly regret my comment that I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me  I know all I did was attack him and his supporters and got people not to vote for him  When I said that comment it was because I was confused how this evil man got elected President and I thought maybe instead of hurting his campaign  maybe I had helped it  My intention was to get his supporters NOT to vote for him and I know for a fact that I accomplished that goal  The far right  a lot of the Bible thumpers and alt right were going to vote him regardless  but I know I swayed so many that were on the fence              
In       Horner stated that a fake story of his about a rape festival in India helped generate over          in donations to GiveIndia  a site that helps rape victims in India                                         Horner said he dislikes being grouped with people who write fake news solely to be misleading   They just write it just to write fake news  like there s no purpose  there s no satire  there s nothing clever

Neither the words  fake  nor  news  effectively capture this polluted information ecosystem  Much of the content used as examples in debates on this topic are not fake  they are genuine but used out of context or manipulated  Similarly  to understand the entire ecosystem of polluted information  we need to consider far more than content that mimics  news               
In October       a hoax claim made by a spoof Twitter account  about the supposed reopening of Woolworths stores  was repeated without verification by news sites including the Daily Mail and Daily Mirror  and the latter s regional sister titles

Indonesia
Indonesia is reported to have the fourth highest number of Facebook users in the world               Indonesia has seen an increase in the amount of fake news and hoaxes on social media  particularly around elections in      and                                 This has been accompanied by increased polarization within the country              
During the      presidential election  the eventual winning candidate Joko Widodo became a target of a smear campaign by Prabowo Subianto s supporters that falsely claimed he was the child of Indonesian Communist Party members  of Chinese descent  and a Christian               After Widodo won  Subianto challenged the results  making claims of widespread fraud that were not upheld  Observers found that the election was carried out fairly

Fake news in Indonesia frequently tends to be related to alleged Chinese imperialism  including Sinicization   Christianization               and communization              
Inflaming ethnic and political tensions is potentially deadly in Indonesia  with its recent incidences of domestic terrorism  and its long and bloody history of anti communist  anti Christian and anti Chinese pogroms cultivated by Suharto s U S  backed right wing dictatorship                                        
The Indonesian government  watchdog groups  and even religious organizations have taken steps to prevent the spreading of disinformation  through steps such as blocking certain websites and creating fact check apps  The largest Islamic mass organization in Indonesia  Nahdlatul Ulama  has created an anti fake news campaign called  TurnBackHoax  while other Islamic groups have defined such propagation as tantamount to sin               While the government currently views criminal punishment as the last resort  officials are working hard to guarantee law enforcement will respect the freedom of expression

Mexico
Main article  Pe abot
In Mexico  people tend to rely heavily on social media and direct social contact as news sources  over television and print              
Usage of and trust in all types of news sources  including social media  declined from      to       As of       the most used media companies in Mexico were TV Azteca news and Televisa              
Televisa is both Mexico s largest television network and the largest media network in the Spanish speaking world              
The three most frequently used social media platforms were Facebook  YouTube  and WhatsApp              
Prior to       the country s major television networks were central to political communication in Mexico  They were also closely connected to the long dominant PRI political party               Televiso has been criticized by journalists and academics for misrepresentation and manipulation of information  and attacks on opponents               Televiso shaped the campaign of Enrique Pe a Nieto              whose Presidency from      to      was marked by scandals and decreased trust in television and print media              
By the      Mexican general election  coordinated online disinformation campaigns were part of an  explosion of digital politics  in Mexico                                        
Mexican politicians used digital strategies and algorithms to boost their apparent popularity and undermine or overwhelm opposing messages              
Attempts to  hack  the  attention economy  were made to amplify false narratives  capture attention and dominate discourse                            A network of trolls was formed as early as       to be activated as needed in support of Pe a Nieto  Estimates of the number of people involved  and how many were paid  vary widely from        to         people  Bots were also used to amplify messages and create  false universes of followers                Opposing voices were drowned out by generating large volumes of meaningless responses from  ghost followers                In one incident that was analyzed     spam accounts generated       tweets per day              
Government activities following Pe a Nieto s election included the amplification of support for controversial government initiatives               
After the killing or disappearance of a group of activist students in       algorithms were used to sabotage trending hashtags on Twitter such as  YaMeCanse  IHaveHadEnough                Bots and trolls have also been used for threats and personal attacks              
Between      and       the hashtag  SalarioRosa  Pink Salary for Vulnerability  was associated with political figure Alfredo del Mazo Maza and pushed to the top of Twitter s trending list through astroturfing  creating an appearance of grassroots support  Photographs of women were associated with fake accounts to create the impression that women were engaged in the discussion   mimicking conversation               
As of              of people surveyed in Mexico worried about false information or fake news being used as a weapon  the highest rate of any country in the world              
During the      election  bot battles between candidates drowned out conversations by posting attacks  rumors  unsubstantiated claims  and deepfaked videos                            Forty percent of the election related tweets on Twitter mentioned Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador  AMLO   None of his opponents reached twenty percent of the tweets                                   
Automation and artificial amplification used both commercial and political bot services  At one point at least ten pro  and anti AMLO bots posted over a thousand tweets in a matter of hours using the hashtag  AMLOFest                                   
The collaborative journalism project Verificado      was established to address misinformation during the      presidential election  It involved at least eighty organizations  including local and national media outlets  universities and civil society and advocacy groups  The group researched online claims and political statements and published joint verifications  During the course of the election  they produced over     notes and    videos documenting false claims and suspect sites  and tracked instances where fake news went viral                                                 Verificado mx received     million visits during the election  with its partner organizations registering millions more                                   
One of the tactics they observed was the promotion of fabricated polls that exaggerated the support for various candidates  The fake polls were claimed to have been carried out by sources such as The New York Times and El Universal  one of Mexico s top newspapers               
Another tactic was to share encrypted messages via WhatsApp  In response  Verificado set up a hotline where WhatsApp users could submit messages for verification and debunking  Over        users subscribed to Verificado s hotline              
Fake messages included false information about where and how to vote                                                 One campaign urged anti AMLO voters to check boxes for both of his opponents an action that would result in disqualification of the vote              
Since being elected president in       Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador  AMLO  s behavior toward the media has been adversarial  He has used his morning addresses or ma aneras to target journalists such as Carmen Aristegui  Carlos Loret de Mola  and Victor Trujillo  Article     an international human rights organization  considers the Mexican government to be using a  strategy of disinformation  while limiting access to public sources of information  Article    estimates that       of the public information provided by the Mexican government is false               
As of       Mexico became the most dangerous country in the world for journalists                            with a higher death toll than active war zones              
During the pandemic  use of social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook increased  In Mexico  the user base of the video app TikTok tripled from      to       reaching    million viewers               Patterns of Twitter activity during the pandemic suggest that astroturfing was used to create an appearance of widespread grassroots support for AMLO and for Hugo L pez Gatell at a time when both men were being criticized for their handling of the COVID    pandemic in Mexico

The Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation commenced on    February       around    months after the Australian Government asked digital platforms to develop a voluntary code to address disinformation and misinformation and assist users of their services to more easily identify the reliability  trustworthiness and source of news content  The request is part of a broader Australian Government strategy to reform the technology and information dissemination landscape  The Australian Communications and Media Authority  ACMA  oversaw the development of the code  In its      report to government on the code  ACMA recommended that the government introduce legislation to grant ACMA powers to enforce the code  to request transparency reports and other information from digital platforms about their misinformation measures and to conduct investigations               Responding to the report  the Coalition government indicated in March      that it would proceed with legislation  Following the      federal election  the new Labor government continued the legislative program and in June      a draft bill was released for public consultation               Despite their earlier support for regulation  the Liberal National coalition  now in opposition  voiced concerns that granting ACMA powers to regulate misinformation would endanger freedom of speech  There was also significant opposition to the bill from right leaning media outlets  while experts voiced concerns about the design of the bill  The consultation on the legislation received      public submissions and over        comments  many opposing the bill               In September       a revised bill was introduced to parliament and immediately referred to the Senate Communications Legislation Committee  which conducted an inquiry into the bill  Despite including significant changes to better protect freedom of expression  the bill failed to gain sufficient support to pass through the Senate and was withdrawn by the government on    November               
A well known case of fabricated news in Australia happened in      when a report  Deception detection across Australian populations  by a  Levitt Institute  was widely cited on news websites across the country  claiming that Sydney was the most naive city  despite the fact that the report itself contained a clue  amidst the mathematical gibberish  there was a statement   These results were completely made up to be fictitious material through a process of modified truth and credibility nodes               

Misuse of term
The term fake news has at times been used to cast doubt upon credible negative news  Some countries have  fake news  laws that is essentially censorship on negative news 

United States
See also  False or misleading statements by Donald Trump
Donald Trump frequently mentioned fake news on Twitter to criticize the media in the United States  including CNN and The New York Times 
Throughout his campaign and presidency  former U S  president Donald Trump has misused the term numerous times  using it to describe any negative press coverage of himself he personally dislikes rather than actual false news                                                      Trump has claimed that the mainstream American media  which he calls the  lying press   regularly reports  fake news  or  hoax news   despite the fact that he generated considerable false and inaccurate or misleading statements himself                           According to The Washington Post     s Fact Checker s database  Trump made        false or misleading claims during his four years in office  though the number of unique false claims is much lower because many of his major false claims were repeated hundreds of times each  A searchable online database is available for each documented false claim  and a datafile is available for download for use in academic studies of misinformation and lying               An analysis of the first        false claims is available as a book              
Trump has often attacked mainstream news reporting publications  deeming them  fake news  and the  enemy of the people                                                                    Every few days  Trump would issue a threat against the press due to his claims of  fake news   There have been many instances in which norms that protect press freedom have been pushed or even upended during the Trump era              
According to Jeff Hemsley  a Syracuse University professor who studies social media  Trump uses this term for any news that is not favorable to him or which he simply dislikes              Trump provided a widely cited                                                     example of this interpretation in a tweet on May

The Fake News is working overtime  Just reported that  despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy  amp  all things else      of the Network News about me is negative  Fake   Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt  Take away credentials

Chris Cillizza described the tweet on CNN as an  accidental  revelation about Trump s   fake news  attacks   and wrote   The point can be summed up in these two words from Trump   negative  Fake    To Trump  those words mean the same thing  Negative news coverage is fake news  Fake news is negative news coverage                Other writers made similar comments about the tweet  Dara Lind wrote in Vox   It s nice of Trump to admit  explicitly  what many skeptics have suspected all along  When he complains about  fake news   he doesn t actually mean  news that is untrue   he means news that is personally inconvenient to Donald Trump                Jonathan Chait wrote in New York magazine   Trump admits he calls all negative news  fake      In a tweet this morning  Trump casually opened a window into the source code for his method of identifying liberal media bias  Anything that s negative is  by definition  fake                Philip Bump wrote in The Washington Post   The important thing in that tweet          is that he makes explicit his view of what constitutes fake news  It s negative news  Negative   Fake                 In an interview with Lesley Stahl  before the cameras were turned on  Trump explained why he attacks the press   You know why I do it  I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so that when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you               
Author and literary critic Michiko Kakutani has described developments in the right wing media and websites 



 Fox News and the planetary system of right wing news sites that would orbit it and  later  Breitbart  were particularly adept at weaponizing such arguments and exploiting the increasingly partisan fervor animating the Republican base  They accused the media establishment of  liberal bias   and substituted their own right wing views as  fair and balanced  a redefinition of terms that was a harbinger of Trump s hijacking of  fake news  to refer not to alt right conspiracy theories and Russian troll posts  but to real news that he perceived as inconvenient or a threat to himself               



In September       National Public Radio noted that Trump has expanded his use of the terms fake and phony to  an increasingly wide variety of things he doesn t like    The range of things Trump is declaring fake is growing too  Last month he tweeted about  fake books    the fake dossier    fake CNN   and he added a new claim that Google search results are  RIGGED  to mostly show only negative stories about him   They graphed his expanding use in columns labeled   Fake news    Fake  other  and  Phony

In March       Russia passed a bill to ban websites from spreading what the Russian government considers false information               In addition to tackling fake news  the new legislation specifically punishes any sources or websites for publishing materials that insult the state  the symbol of the government or other political figures  For repeated offenders  they would receive a    day jail sentence              
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine  the Russian government passed a law prohibiting  fake news  regarding the Russian military  which was broadly defined as any information that is deemed by the Russian government to be false  including the use of the terms invasion and war to refer to the invasion                            Violations of the law are punishable with up to    years of imprisonment  International news organizations in multiple countries ceased operating in Russia and journalists emigrated from Russia en masse after the law was passed  while some domestic non state news organizations were blocked by the Russian government
