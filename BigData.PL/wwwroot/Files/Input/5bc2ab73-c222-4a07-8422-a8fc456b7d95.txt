J rgen Schmidhuber  born    January                  is a German computer scientist noted for his work in the field of artificial intelligence  specifically artificial neural networks  He is a scientific director of the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research in Switzerland             He is also director of the Artificial Intelligence Initiative and professor of the Computer Science program in the Computer  Electrical  and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering  CEMSE  division at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology  KAUST  in Saudi Arabia                       
He is best known for his foundational and highly cited            work on long short term memory  LSTM   a type of neural network architecture which was the dominant technique for various natural language processing tasks in research and commercial applications in the     s  He also introduced principles of dynamic neural networks  meta learning  generative adversarial networks                                  and linear transformers                                    all of which are widespread in modern AI 


Career edit 
Schmidhuber completed his undergraduate        and PhD        studies at the Technical University of Munich in Munich  Germany             His PhD advisors were Wilfried Brauer and Klaus Schulten              He taught there from      until       From                   until       he was a professor of artificial intelligence at the Universit  della Svizzera Italiana in Lugano  Switzerland            
He has served as the director of Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research  IDSIA   a Swiss AI lab  since                 
In       Schmidhuber formed a company  Nnaisense  to work on commercial applications of artificial intelligence in fields such as finance  heavy industry and self driving cars  Sepp Hochreiter  Jaan Tallinn  and Marcus Hutter are advisers to the company             Sales were under US    million in       however  Schmidhuber states that the current emphasis is on research and not revenue  Nnaisense raised its first round of capital funding in January       Schmidhuber s overall goal is to create an all purpose AI by training a single AI in sequence on a variety of narrow tasks             

Research edit 
In the     s  backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths in artificial neural networks  To overcome this problem  Schmidhuber        proposed a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks  RNNs  pre trained one level at a time by self supervised learning              It uses predictive coding  to learn internal representations at multiple self organizing time scales  This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning  The RNN hierarchy can be collapsed into a single RNN  by distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network                          In       a chunker solved a deep learning task whose depth exceeded                  
In       Schmidhuber published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a zero sum game  where one network s gain is the other network s loss                                               The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns  The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns  This was called  artificial curiosity   In       this principle was used in a generative adversarial network where the environmental reaction is   or   depending on whether the first network s output is in a given set  GANs were the state of the art in generative modeling during           period 
Schmidhuber supervised the      diploma thesis of his student Sepp Hochreiter             which he considered  one of the most important documents in the history of machine learning               It studied the neural history compressor              and more importantly analyzed and overcame the vanishing gradient problem  This led to the long short term memory  LSTM   a type of recurrent neural network  The name LSTM was introduced in a tech report        
leading to the most cited LSTM publication         co authored by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber              
It was not yet the standard LSTM architecture which is used in almost all current applications  The standard LSTM architecture was introduced in      by Felix Gers  Schmidhuber  and Fred Cummins              Today s  vanilla LSTM  using backpropagation through time was published with his student Alex Graves in                               and its connectionist temporal classification  CTC  training algorithm             in       CTC was applied to end to end speech recognition with LSTM  By the     s  the LSTM became the dominant technique for a variety of natural language processing tasks including speech recognition and machine translation  and was widely implemented in commercial technologies such as Google Neural Machine Translation              have also been used in Google Voice for transcription             and search              and Siri             
In       the state of the art was training  very deep neural network  with    to    layers              Stacking too many layers led to a steep reduction in training accuracy              known as the  degradation  problem              In May       Rupesh Kumar Srivastava  Klaus Greff  and Schmidhuber used LSTM principles to create the highway network  a feedforward neural network with hundreds of layers  much deeper than previous networks                                     In Dec       the residual neural network  ResNet  was published  which is a variant of the highway network                         
In       Schmidhuber published fast weights programmer  an alternative to recurrent neural networks             It has a slow feedforward neural network that learns by gradient descent to control the fast weights of another neural network through outer products of self generated activation patterns  and the fast weights network itself operates over inputs               This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer                                      Schmidhuber used the terminology  learning internal spotlights of attention  in                  
In       Schmidhuber s team at IDSIA with his postdoc Dan Ciresan also achieved dramatic speedups of convolutional neural networks  CNNs  on fast parallel computers called GPUs  An earlier CNN on GPU by Chellapilla et al         was   times faster than an equivalent implementation on CPU              The deep CNN of Dan Ciresan et al         at IDSIA was already    times faster             and achieved the first superhuman performance in a computer vision contest in August                   Between    May      and    September       these CNNs won four more image competitions                         and improved the state of the art on multiple image benchmarks              The approach has become central to the field of computer vision              It is based on CNN designs introduced much earlier by Kunihiko Fukushima                         

Credit disputes edit 
Schmidhuber has controversially argued that he and other researchers have been denied adequate recognition for their contribution to the field of deep learning  in favour of Geoffrey Hinton  Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun  who shared the      Turing Award for their work in deep learning                                     He wrote a  scathing       article arguing that Hinton  Bengio and Lecun  heavily cite each other  but  fail to credit the pioneers of the field               In a statement to the New York Times  Yann LeCun wrote that  J rgen is manically obsessed with recognition and keeps claiming credit he doesn t deserve for many  many things    It causes him to systematically stand up at the end of every talk and claim credit for what was just presented  generally not in a justified manner              Schmidhuber replied that LeCun did this  without any justification  without providing a single example               and published details of numerous priority disputes with Hinton  Bengio and LeCun                         
The term  schmidhubered  has been jokingly used in the AI community to describe Schmidhuber s habit of publicly challenging the originality of other researchers  work  a practice seen by some in the AI community as a  rite of passage  for young researchers  Some suggest that Schmidhuber s significant accomplishments have been underappreciated due to his confrontational personality                         

Recognition edit 
Schmidhuber received the Helmholtz Award of the International Neural Network Society in                   and the Neural Networks Pioneer Award of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society in                  for  pioneering contributions to deep learning and neural networks              He is a member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts                         
He has been referred to as the  father of modern AI  or similar              the  father of Generative AI               and also the  father of deep learning                           Schmidhuber himself  however  has called Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko the  father of deep learning                           and gives credit to many even earlier AI pioneers             

Views edit 
Schmidhuber is a proponent of open source AI  and believes that they will become competitive against commercial closed source AI            
Since the     s  Schmidhuber wanted to create  intelligent machines that could learn and improve on their own and become smarter than him within his lifetime              He differentiates between two types of AIs  tool AI  such as those for improving healthcare  and autonomous AIs that set their own goals  perform their own research  and explore the universe  He has worked on both types for decades             He expects the next stage of evolution to be self improving AIs that will succeed human civilization as the next stage in the universal increase towards ever increasing complexity  and he expects AI to colonize the visible universe
