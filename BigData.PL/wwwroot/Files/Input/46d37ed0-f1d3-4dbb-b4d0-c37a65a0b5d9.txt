							CAIRO  Some    Egyptians arrested in November are being questioned by prosecutors for allegedly planning terrorist attacks  a security official and a lawyer said Sunday 
The security official said the suspects were arrested on charges of stockpiling weapons and explosives to be used in        attacks against targets inside Egypt   The men were arrested in Mansoura  northeast of Cairo  two months ago and are believed to be members of a new Islamic militant group 
The official and lawyer both spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigations 
       They are accused of forming a new Islamic militant group based on ideas of Sayyid Qutb   said the lawyer referring to an Egyptian ideologue executed in      whose ideas provide much of the intellectual basis for today       s militant groups 
The Egyptian independent daily Al Masry Al Youm reported Sunday that the group was planning to attack US ships in the Suez Canal and the tomb of revered Jewish holy man  Abu Hatzira in the Nile Delta 
Quoting security officials  the paper also said the group was planning to ship weapons and explosives to Hamas for use in their rockets 
The report added that some of the suspects have received training in the troubled Sudanese region of Darfur 
Egypt security forces have recently reported the arrest of several new militant groups looking to carry out attacks against Egyptian and foreign targets  mainly US and Israeli interests 
Commenting on news of the recent arrests  Diaa Rashwan  an expert on Islamist movements at Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies  was weary of the reference to Sayyid Qutb 
       I don       t know what they mean by mentioning  that the detainees  follow the ideas of Sayyid Qutb  but they might mean that they are extremists as he had extremists ideas  
He did warn  however  against the media       s tendency to treat what he referred to as        security leaks   emphasizing that such media reports must not be considered facts until there is a court case and those involves face legal charges 
He added that since the      terrorist attack in Luxor  the state has only initiated two cases against extremists for the Khan El Khalili bombing in      and the recent      Al Hussein bombing 
Islamist lawyer Montasser El Zayat  who represents some of the suspects  categorically denies that the detainees were planning any terrorist attacks 
 These people did nothing but may confess under duress to crimes they did not commit   he told Daily News Egypt 
He accused state security of using violence to extract confessions and of holding the suspects illegally without allowing them access to either their families or even their lawyer 
 They are political activists who hold religious views against the government and this is why they have been arrest   he said   AP with additional reporting by Omnia Al Desoukie for Daily News Egypt
