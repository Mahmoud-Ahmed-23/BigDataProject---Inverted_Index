Omar El Nagdi s latest gallery  Impulsive Expressionism II  is currently on display at Al Masar Gallery  The exhibition is filled with colourful paintings that mix a contemporary style with traditional folkloric symbols 
El Nagdi explained his artistic character   My journey with visual arts started in my childhood  and in      I started to participate in exhibitions  I became a member of the Liberal Artists group  which was headed by its honorary president and dean of Arab Literature  Taha Hussein   My artistic character developed between the Bab Al She reya neighbourhood and rural Egypt  The influences of the popular area s noise and the quietness of the rural environment were complete opposites  This affected my artistic personality by making me unable to commit to a certain artistic style  
He added   My artistic journey was enriched by witnessing the unity of subject  accompanied by different branches of method  I learnt the techniques of Fine Art  Applied Art and artists  supplements  which allowed me to be artistically unique  That is why I was awarded    local and international prizes  and obtained the French Parliament s medal  There is a museum in my name in France  which organises exhibitions all over the country  In the sixties  my work was exhibited with    other international artists such as Pablo Picasso  Dali  Claude Monet and other master artists of the   th century   I formed the first Egyptian mosaics group in       and afterwards  I formed the Phoenix group   The Phoenix  is that mythical Arabic bird which does not exist  but soars in every existence       that is visual art  
About the current exhibition he said   My inspiration for this collection was the East  history  culture and civilisation  I wanted to do an exhibition that includes all the techniques I use in oil painting  etching  sculpture  negative space equation  and mosaic  In oil painting I use  the technique of  the continuous line  from the beginning of the painting till the end  In addition  I use watercolours and the negative space technique in sculpture  which affected many people  My certificate of creation for this technique is with critic Hussein Ameen Bikar  
One of the techniques that caught our eye in some of his paintings was how he created a sculpture effect  He says this technique is called  the fifth dimension theory  which handles the process of transforming this philosophical dimension into a mathematical one  which can be measured  
 I use sculpture painting in some of my oil paintings   with it  I am teasing the viewer  You can do whatever you want as long as you do not alienate the viewer  The last painting  the Golden Bird or Chess  is a check mate game  in which the black and white kings are gray  and the golden bird is a paradise Curlew  crooning via the melodies of the flute  Its singing is a form of worship or prayer for the people in the artwork   El Nagdi said 
El Nagdi describes his current working method as  Zero Existence   He explains this means  the moment the artist catches his breath when a sudden event is born   El Nagdi continues   At that moment  inspirational subconscious laws rise from the depths in the unconscious state of the self 
This allows the unconscious to bestow  inspiration  which then multiplies in light  darkness and colours while the artist is still in a state of unconsciousness  So he finds himself inside unfamiliar formulas in a flash  shorter than lightening  in one blinding moment  one that is filled with inspirational fountains  which include the irrefutable absolute  This settles in the artist s arsenal  which he can summon whenever he wants 
At the same moment  the artist exchanges a hidden conversation with the sudden event  This is the inspiration that is proclaimed in a phenomenon  and which is hidden in its core  Hence  the subconscious meets the conscious so the creative phenomenon shines in a beautiful work of art
