This article is about the artificial intelligence program  For other uses  see Student  disambiguation  
STUDENT is an early artificial intelligence program that solves algebra word problems  It is written in Lisp by Daniel G  Bobrow as his PhD thesis in       Bobrow        It was designed to read and solve the kind of word problems found in high school algebra books             The program is often cited as an early accomplishment of AI in natural language processing 

Technical description edit 
Within Project MAC at MIT  the STUDENT system was an early example of a question answering software  which uniquely involved natural language processing and symbolic programming             Other early attempts for solving algebra story problems were realized with     s hardware and software as well  for example  the Philips  Baseball and Synthex systems            
STUDENT accepts an algebra story written in the English language as input  and generates a number as output  This is realized with a layered pipeline that consists of heuristics for pattern transformation  At first  sentences in English are converted into kernel sentences  which each contain a single piece of information  Next  the kernel sentences are converted into mathematical expressions             The knowledge base that supports the transformation contains    facts      clarification needed                
STUDENT uses a rule based system with logic inference             The rules are pre programmed by the software developer and are able to parse natural language 
More powerful techniques for natural language processing  such as machine learning  came into use later as hardware grew more capable  and gained popularity over simpler rule based systems
