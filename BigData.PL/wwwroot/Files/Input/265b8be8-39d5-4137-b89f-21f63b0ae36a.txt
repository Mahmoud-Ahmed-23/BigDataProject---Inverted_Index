History
Main article  History of YouTubeSee also  Timeline of online video
Founding and initial growth            
From left to right  Chad Hurley  Steve Chen  and Jawed Karim  the founders of YouTube
YouTube was founded by Steve Chen  Chad Hurley  and Jawed Karim  The trio were early employees of PayPal  which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay              Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania  and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign             
According to a story that has often been repeated in the media  Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of       after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen s apartment in San Francisco  Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred  but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party  was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible              
Karim said the inspiration for YouTube came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy when Janet Jackson s breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the halftime show  Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the      Indian Ocean tsunami online  which led to the idea of a video sharing site                          Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not                          They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a      reward              Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans  with the site s founders deciding to accept uploads of any video             

The YouTube logo used from its launch until           citation needed      it returned in      before being removed again in          citation needed      Another version of this logo without the  Broadcast Yourself  slogan was used until        
YouTube began as a venture capital funded technology startup  Between November      and April       the company raised money from various investors  with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest two                          YouTube s early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo  California              In February       the company activated www youtube com              The first video was uploaded on April           Titled  Me at the zoo   it shows co founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site                          The same day  the company launched a public beta and by November  a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views                          The site exit out of beta in December       by which time the site was receiving        million views a day                          Clips at the time were limited to     megabytes  as little as    seconds of footage             
YouTube was not the first video sharing site on the Internet  Vimeo was founded in November       though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor              The week of YouTube s launch  NBCUniversal Saturday Night Live ran a skit  Lazy Sunday  by The Lonely Island  Besides helping to bolster ratings and long term viewership for Saturday Night Live   Lazy Sunday  s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website              Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February      before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright concerns              Despite eventually being taken down  these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube s reach and led to the upload of more third party content                          The site grew rapidly  in July       the company announced that more than        new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving          million video views per day             
The choice of the name youtube com led to problems for a similarly named website  utube com  That site s owner  Universal Tube  amp  Rollform Equipment  filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November       after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube  Universal Tube subsequently changed its website to www utubeonline com                         

 Broadcast Yourself  era            
On October          Google announced that they had acquired YouTube for            billion in Google stock                          The deal was finalized on November                                   Google s acquisition launched newfound interest in video sharing sites  IAC  which now owned Vimeo  focused on supporting the content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube              It is at this time YouTube issued the slogan  Broadcast Yourself  
The company experienced rapid growth  The Daily Telegraph wrote that in       YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in                   By       the company had reached a market share of around     and more than         billion views of videos  according to comScore              That year  the company simplified its interface to increase the time users would spend on the site              In       more than three billion videos were being watched each day with    hours of new videos uploaded every minute                                      However  most of these views came from a relatively small number of videos  according to a software engineer at that time      of videos accounted for     of views on the site              That year  the company again changed its interface and at the same time  introduced a new logo with a darker shade of red                          A subsequent interface change  designed to unify the experience across desktop  TV  and mobile  was rolled out in                   By that point  more than     hours were being uploaded every minute  increasing to     hours by November                              

YouTube s headquarters in San Bruno  California  April     
During that time  the company also went through some organizational changes  In October       YouTube moved to a new office in San Bruno  California              Hurley announced that he would be stepping down as chief executive officer of YouTube to take an advisory role and that Salar Kamangar would take over as head of the company in October                   In December       YouTube partnered with Vevo              In April       Lady Gaga s  Bad Romance  became the most viewed video  becoming the first video to reach          million views on May                     
YouTube faced a major lawsuit by Viacom International in      that nearly resulted in the discontinuation of the website  The lawsuit was filed due to alleged copyright infringement of Viacom s material by YouTube  However  the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that YouTube was not liable  and thus YouTube won the case in                  

Susan Wojcicki s leadership            
YouTube logo from      until     
Susan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube in February                   In January       YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for           million  The complex has        square metres          square feet  of space and can house up to       employees              YouTube officially launched the  polymer  redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design language as its default  as well as a redesigned logo that is built around the service s play button emblem in August                  
Through this period  YouTube tried several new ways to generate revenue beyond advertisements  In       YouTube launched a pilot program for content providers to offer premium  subscription based channels                          This effort was discontinued in January      and relaunched in June  with US      channel subscriptions                          These channel subscriptions complemented the existing Super Chat ability  launched in       which allows viewers to donate between    and      to have their comment highlighted              In       YouTube announced a subscription service known as  Music Key   which bundled ad free streaming of music content on YouTube with the existing Google Play Music service              The service continued to evolve in      when YouTube announced YouTube Red  a new premium service that would offer ad free access to all content on the platform  succeeding the Music Key service released the previous year   premium original series  and films produced by YouTube personalities  as well as background playback of content on mobile devices  YouTube also released YouTube Music  a third app oriented towards streaming and discovering the music content hosted on the YouTube platform                                     
The company also attempted to create products appealing to specific viewers  YouTube released a mobile app known as YouTube Kids in       which was designed to provide an experience optimized for children  It features a simplified user interface  curated selections of channels featuring age appropriate content  and parental control features              Also in       YouTube launched YouTube Gaming a video gaming oriented vertical and app for videos and live streaming  intended to compete with the Amazon com owned Twitch             
The company was attacked on April          when a shooting occurred at YouTube s headquarters in San Bruno  California  which wounded four and resulted in the death of the shooter             
By February       one billion hours of YouTube videos were being watched every day  and     hours worth of videos were uploaded every minute                         Two years later  the uploads had risen to more than     hours per minute             During the COVID    pandemic  when most of the world was under stay at home orders  usage of services like YouTube significantly increased  One data firm     which       estimated that YouTube was accounting for     of all internet traffic  twice its pre pandemic level              In response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth as to make sure medical entities had sufficient bandwidth to share information  YouTube and Netflix said they would reduce streaming quality for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by     to comply with the EU s request              YouTube later announced that they would continue with this move worldwide   We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation              
After a      complaint alleging violations of the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act  COPPA               the company was fined           million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under the age of                 YouTube was also ordered to create systems to increase children s privacy                          Following criticisms of its implementation of those systems  YouTube started treating all videos designated as  made for kids  as liable under COPPA on January                                  Joining the YouTube Kids app  the company created a supervised mode  designed more for tweens  in                   Additionally  to compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels  YouTube released YouTube Shorts  a short form video platform             
During that period  YouTube entered disputes with other tech companies  For over a year  in      and       no YouTube app was available for Amazon Fire products              In       Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its streaming store after the two companies were unable to reach an agreement             
After testing earlier in       YouTube removed public display of dislike counts on videos in November       claiming the reason for the removal was  based on its internal research  that users often used the dislike feature as a form of cyberbullying and brigading              While some users praised the move as a way to discourage trolls  others felt that hiding dislikes would make it harder for viewers to recognize clickbait or unhelpful videos and that other features already existed for creators to limit bullying  YouTube co founder Jawed Karim referred to the update as  a stupid idea   and that the real reason behind the change was  not a good one  and not one that will be publicly disclosed   He felt that users  ability on a social platform to identify harmful content was essential  saying   The process works  and there s a name for it  the wisdom of the crowds  The process breaks when the platform interferes with it  Then  the platform invariably declines                                       Shortly after the announcement  software developer Dmitry Selivanov created Return YouTube Dislike  an open source  third party browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows users to see a video s number of dislikes              In a letter published on January           by then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki  acknowledged that removing public dislike counts was a controversial decision  but reiterated that she stands by this decision  claiming that  it reduced dislike attacks              
In       YouTube launched an experiment where the company would show users who watched longer videos on TVs a long chain of short unskippable adverts  intending to consolidate all ads into the beginning of a video  Following public outrage over the unprecedented amount of unskippable ads  YouTube  ended  the experiment on September    of that year              In October  YouTube announced that they would be rolling out customizable user handles in addition to channel names  which would also become channel URLs

On February           Wojcicki announced that she would step down as CEO  with Neal Mohan named as her successor  Wojcicki took on an advisory role for Google and parent company Alphabet              Wojcicki died a year and a half later from non small cell lung cancer  on August                     
In late October       YouTube began cracking down on the use of ad blockers on the platform  Users of ad blockers may be given a pop up warning saying  Video player will be blocked after   videos   Users of ad blockers are shown a message asking them to allow ads or inviting them to subscribe to the ad free YouTube Premium subscription plan  YouTube says that the use of ad blockers violates its terms of service                            In April       YouTube announced it would be  strengthening our enforcement on third party apps that violate YouTube s Terms of Service  specifically ad blocking apps                Starting in June       Google Chrome announced that it would be replacing Manifest V  in favor of Manifest V   effectively killing support for most ad blockers               Manifest V  allows YouTube to inject the ads directly into the video  instead of having the ad as a separate file which can be blocked              
In September       YouTube announced an in app gaming platform called Playables  It was made accessible to all users in May       expanding from an initial offering limited to premium subscribers  In December       YouTube began testing a new multiplayer feature for that service  supporting multiplayer functionality across desktop and mobile devices  As of December          update      the Playables catalog has over     games in various genres including trivia  action and sports                           
In December       YouTube introduced new guidelines prohibiting videos with clickbait titles to enhance content quality and combat misinformation  The platform aims to penalize creators using misleading or sensationalized titles  with potential actions including video removal or channel suspension               According to YouTube  this guideline will gradually roll out in India first  but will expand to more countries in the coming months

In January       it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of    minutes a day on the site  in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television               In       viewers on average watched YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day              
In December       two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube  prompting a claim by The Daily Dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site s terms of service  which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts  That was disputed by Billboard  which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo  since the videos were no longer active on YouTube                            On August          YouTube patched the formerly notorious behavior which caused a video s view count to freeze at        later         until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud               YouTube view counts once again updated in real time               Since September       subscriber counts are abbreviated  Only three leading digits of channels  subscriber counts are indicated publicly  compromising the function of third party real time indicators such as that of Social Blade  Exact counts remain available to channel operators inside YouTube Studio              
On November           after testing out this change in March of the same year  YouTube announced it would start hiding dislike counts on videos  making them invisible to viewers  The company stated the decision was in response to experiments which confirmed that smaller YouTube creators were more likely to be targeted in dislike brigading and harassment  Creators will still be able to see the number of likes and dislikes in the YouTube Studio dashboard tool  according to YouTube                                        
YouTube has an estimated           billion videos with about    of those never having a view              Just over     have fewer than       views              

Copyright issues

Further information         Revenue to copyright holders
YouTube has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright  including the site s first viral video  Lazy Sunday  which had to be taken down  due to copyright concerns              At the time of uploading a video  YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws               Despite this advice  many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube  YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online  and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act  Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike  Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted                            From      to      organizations including Viacom  Mediaset  and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube  claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material                                        
In August       a US court ruled in Lenz v  Universal Music Corp  that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material               YouTube s owner Google announced in November      that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use defenses apply              
In the      case of Smith v  Summit Entertainment LLC  professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube               He asserted seven causes of action  and four were ruled in Smith s favor               In April       a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users               On November          the dispute with GEMA was resolved  with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by GEMA              
In April       it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored  even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter notice                            As part of YouTube Music  Universal and YouTube signed an agreement in       which was followed by separate agreements other major labels  which gave the company the right to advertising revenue when its music was played on YouTube               By       creators were having videos taken down or demonetized when Content ID identified even short segments of copyrighted music within a much longer video  with different levels of enforcement depending on the record label               Experts noted that some of these clips said qualified for fair use              

Content ID
Main article  Content ID
In June       YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright  Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom  which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute               The system  which was initially called  Video Identification                            and later became known as Content ID               creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material  and stores it in a database  When a video is uploaded  it is checked against the database  and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found               When this occurs  the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable  tracking the viewing statistics of the video  or adding advertisements to the video 
An independent test in      uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that while the system was  surprisingly resilient  in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos  it was not infallible               The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases  as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use               If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID  it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision

Jordan Hoffner at the   th Annual Peabody Awards accepting for YouTube
Observing that face to face communication of the type that online videos convey has been  fine tuned by millions of years of evolution   TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that  what Gutenberg did for writing  online video can now do for face to face communication                Anderson asserted that it is not far fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance  and that video contributors may be about to launch  the biggest learning cycle in human history                In education  for example  the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan s cousin into what Forbes      Michael Noer called  the largest school in the world   with technology poised to disrupt how people learn               YouTube was awarded a      George Foster Peabody Award               the website being described as a Speakers  Corner that  both embodies and promotes democracy                The Washington Post reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube s most subscribed channels feature minorities  contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white               A Pew Research Center study reported the development of  visual journalism   in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation               The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news              
YouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government  such as in the CNN YouTube presidential debates        in which ordinary people submitted questions to U S  presidential candidates via YouTube video  with a techPresident co founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape               Describing the Arab Spring              sociologist Philip N  Howard quoted an activist s succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using  Facebook to schedule the protests  Twitter to coordinate  and YouTube to tell the world                In       more than a third of the U S  Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony    days after the  Kony       video was posted to YouTube  with resolution co sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video  will do more to lead to  Kony s  demise than all other action combined               

Prominent YouTube content creators met at the White House with U S  President Obama to discuss how government could better connect with the  YouTube generation

In March       the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube  after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content  The government demanded assurances that its advertising would  be delivered safely and appropriately   The Guardian newspaper  as well as other major British and U S  brands  similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content  Google stated that it had  begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear                             In early April       the YouTube channel h h Productions presented evidence claiming that a Wall Street Journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video  citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader  The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video                           
On April          YouTube announced that to  ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules   it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review  and have at least        lifetime views  before they may join the Partner Program

There are over two million members of the YouTube Partner Program               According to TubeMogul  in      a pre roll advertisement on YouTube  one that is shown before the video starts  cost advertisers on average       per      views  Usually  no more than half of the eligible videos have a pre roll advertisement  due to a lack of interested advertisers

In the United States as of November       and June      worldwide               YouTube reserves the right to monetize any video on the platform  even if their uploader is not a member of the YouTube Partner Program  This will occur on channels whose content is deemed  advertiser friendly   and all revenue will go directly to Google without any share given to the uploader              

Revenue to copyright holders
The majority of YouTube s advertising revenue goes to the publishers and video producers who hold the rights to their videos  the company retains     of the ad revenue               In       it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders  YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue               In May       Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games               In February       Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators through the Nintendo Creators Program                                         On March           Nintendo announced on Twitter that the company will end the Creators program  Operations for the program ceased on March
