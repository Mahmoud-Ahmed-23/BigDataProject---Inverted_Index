							In light of ongoing  successive collapses  boundless bloodshed  and deepening divisions across the Arab world  a voice suddenly whispers to the common people         The appearance of the Mahdi is near        be patient  for these trials are signs of his closeness        
These messages  though cloaked in religious hope  are far from innocent  They form part of a comprehensive  diabolical plan orchestrated by intertwined political  religious  military  and intelligence forces all working to numb the consciousness of Arab peoples and psychologically prepare them for a foundational transformation  the restructuring of the Middle East on new terms stripped of sovereignty  identity  and genuine resistance 
The        appearance of the Mahdi        is not solely a religious concept  It has become a psychological political instrument activated whenever authoritarian regimes or hegemonic powers seek to suppress popular outrage or deflect attention from massacres and strategic concessions  Recent statements by Iranian cleric Mohammad Mahdi Mir Baqeri  close to the Supreme Leader  exemplify this manipulation  He declared 
 The process of bringing forth the Imam of the Age in the world has begun  and the command for his appearance has been issued  It is in the process of realization        trials and challenges must occur before empowerment  
Such words are saturated with deceit  speaking directly to the collective emotional psyche at a moment of extreme vulnerability  Political catastrophe is rebranded as  preparation for relief   and despair is reframed as  part of a divine plan   Instead of resisting the humiliation  hunger  and devastation imposed upon them  people are led to believe that these sufferings are necessary perhaps even blessed because the Mahdi is near  This is not faith it is strategy  A methodical sedation of public awareness  no different from the opiate Marx described when he portrayed religion as a tool of authority 
As crises intensify  references to  preparation  and  appearance  multiply  People increasingly and reflexively associate collapse with salvation  and massacres with imminent victory without a shred of tangible evidence  Worse still  certain Islamic movements have become integral to this dangerous narrative  Hamas played a pivotal role in one of its most perilous episodes on October  th 
Dr  Hatem Sadek
Set aside the chants and slogans  A cold  dispassionate analysis raises troubling questions  How did Hamas execute such a large scale operation without broader coordination or a defined post strike strategy  How did thousands of Palestinian families end up in the abyss of Israeli retaliation while no other front meaningfully moved  Was this outcome unforeseen or  in some circles  quietly desired 
On a silver platter  Hamas handed Israel the very pretext it had long awaited  justification for expansion and utter devastation in Gaza  the emptying of its population  the erasure of true resistance  and the military and demographic re engineering of the region  Meanwhile  the masses were distracted chanting  hoping  waiting        or whispering   O Allah  hasten the appearance of the Mahdi  
Here lies the core question  Are we witnessing strategic naivety  Or complicity masked as resistance  Has Hamas  wittingly or unwittingly  fallen into the snare of a far larger design  One not devised solely in military command centers  but also in the shadowy offices of British and American intelligence agencies experts in psychological warfare  social dismantling  and public manipulation to reshape the region in service of their own interests 
The covert role of Western intelligence in embedding and amplifying apocalyptic ideas is not new  For decades  agencies such as MI  and the CIA have used  political Islam  as a means of infiltration and influence  But today  the paradigm has shifted  religion is no longer a tool for revolution it is now a sedative  The myth of the Mahdi s imminent return  the glorification of prophecies  and the portrayal of suffering as divine signals are mechanisms to suppress awakening and delay resistance 
The new Middle East is not being constructed through military might alone  but through deep psychological engineering  A cornerstone of this strategy is the manipulation of the religious imagination  What we are witnessing today is the coordinated activation of this apparatus  on one side  the spread of Mahdist rumors in Iran and Iraq  on the other  the intensifying destruction in Gaza  Syria  Yemen  and Lebanon  The aim  to immerse the Arab individual in utter helplessness and to offer  in return  the false comfort of  divine salvation  
All of this unfolds under the watchful eye of Western intelligence  Strings are pulled  strategies are revised  and control mechanisms are recalibrated while peoples are caught between brutal reality and numbing illusion  In this intricate landscape  there is little distinction between a bomb dropped on Gaza and a sermon claiming   The command for the Imam s appearance has been issued   Both are weapons  Both are elements of the same war 
The most perilous development today is not the bombings  the displacement  or the geopolitical schemes  It is the sedation of Arab populations in the name of religion  and the numbing of their emotions and consciousness from opposing the oppression they endure  Anyone who helps spread these rumors of the        near savior         or who justifies mass suffering as  divine trial  without challenging reality and resisting it  is complicit in the crime 
Now is the time to reclaim our awareness  expose this grand deception  and redefine religion as a force of rejection and liberation not sedation and compliance  This is the final front  consciousness  And those who do not defend it will soon find they have nothing left to defend
