Jerry Alan Fodor    fo d r  FOH d r  April            November           was an American philosopher and the author of works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science             His writings in these fields laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses  and he is recognized as having had  an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since                   At the time of his death in       he held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy  Emeritus  at Rutgers University  and had  taught previously at the City University of New York Graduate Center and MIT 


Life and career edit 
Jerry Fodor was born in New York City on April                      and was of Jewish descent  He received his degree  summa cum laude  from Columbia University in       where he wrote a senior thesis on S ren Kierkegaard and studied with Sidney Morgenbesser and Arthur Danto             He then earned a PhD in philosophy from Princeton University in       under the direction of Hilary Putnam            
From      to       Fodor was on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  From      to       he was a full professor at the City University of New York  CUNY   From      until his retirement in      as emeritus  he was State of New Jersey Professor of philosophy and cognitive science at Rutgers University                       
Besides his interest in philosophy  Fodor followed opera and regularly wrote columns for the London Review of Books on that and other topics             Fodor s first marriage was to the applied psychologist Iris Goldstein  with whom he had one son  After their divorce  he married the linguist Janet Dean             Janet and he lived in Manhattan and had a daughter  He died at home on November                     

Philosophical work edit 
Fodor argued in his      book The Language of Thought that mental states  such as beliefs and desires  are relations between individuals and mental representations  He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought  LOT  in the mind  Furthermore  this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool  Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism  maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought                       
For Fodor  significant parts of the mind  such as perceptual and linguistic processes  are structured in terms of modules  or  organs   which he defines by their causal and functional roles  These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the  central processing  part of the mind  which has a more global and less  domain specific  character  Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects  This  in turn  makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world  The central processing part  on the other hand  takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs             
Although Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal  externally determined aspect  in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents  His contributions in this area include the so called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism  Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind  He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher level theory of psychology or linguistics  for example  cannot be captured by the low level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses  He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill grounded Darwinian theories of natural selection as an explanation of mind            

Fodor and the nature of mental states edit 
The structure of a mental state  such as that an individual called Mary believes that a man has bitten a dog  as described by Rudolf Carnap  Gottlob Frege  and Fodor  Fodor s scheme says that a person s attitude to something makes use of a mental representation of that thing             
Despite the changes in many of his positions over the years  Fodor s idea that mental states embodying intentionality  propositional attitudes              like beliefs and desires are relational never changed                          He attempted to show how mental representations  specifically sentences in the language of thought  are necessary to explain this relational nature of mental states  Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses  The first denies the relational character of mental states  while the second considers mental states as two place relations              The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages                                      and the Fregean view that they are between individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences              Fodor s own position  instead  is that to properly account for the nature of intentional attitudes  it is necessary to employ a three place relation between individuals  representations and propositional contents                         
Considering mental states as three place relations in this way  representative realism makes it possible to hold together all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem  Further  mental representations are not only the objects of beliefs and desires  but are also the domain over which mental processes operate  They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of mental content and the computational notion of functional architecture  These notions are  according to Fodor  our best explanation of mental processes                         

Functional architecture of the mind edit 
Psychological nativism and modularity edit 
The M ller Lyer illusion  that two identical lines look to be of differing lengths  even if the subject knows they are the same length  persuaded Fodor that mental processes are grouped in discrete modules without access to each other             
Following in the path paved by linguist Noam Chomsky  Fodor developed a strong commitment to the idea of psychological nativism                          Nativism postulates the innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts  For Fodor  this emerges naturally out of his criticism of behaviourism and associationism  These criticisms led him to formulate his hypothesis of the modularity of the mind                         
Fodor noted the evidence from perceptual errors like the M ller Lyer illusion that processes such as visually estimating the length of a line are not interfered with by the knowledge that the two lines are actually the same length  He took this to mean that the visual processes were in a separate module from knowledge                         

The idea of modularity of mind was presaged by Franz Joseph Gall s   th century phrenology movement 
The idea can be traced back to the   th century phrenology movement  Its founder Franz Joseph Gall claimed that mental faculties were associated with specific regions of the brain  Hence  someone s level of intelligence  for example  could be  read off  from the size of a particular bump on his posterior parietal lobe              This simplistic view of modularity has been disproven in the   th century                         
Fodor revived the idea of modularity  without the notion of precise physical localizability  in the     s  and became a vocal proponent of it with the      publication of his monograph The Modularity of Mind              where he points to Gall through Bernard Hollander s In search of the soul              Two properties of modularity  informational encapsulation and domain specificity  make it possible to relate functional architecture to mental content  A person s ability to elaborate information independently from their background beliefs allows Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of mental content  The main idea is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend  not just on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part  but also on their causal relations with the external world                         

Adoption by cognitive and evolutionary psychologists edit 
Fodor s notions of mental modularity  informational encapsulation and domain specificity were taken up and expanded  much to Fodor s chagrin  by cognitive scientists such as Zenon Pylyshyn and evolutionary psychologists such as Steven Pinker and Henry Plotkin                                      Fodor complained that Pinker  Plotkin and other members of what he sarcastically called  the New Synthesis  had taken modularity and similar ideas way too far  He insisted that the mind is not  massively modular  and that  contrary to these researchers  the mind was a long way from having been explained by the computational  or any other  model  The main reason for this is that most cognition is abductive and global  hence sensitive to all possibly relevant background beliefs to  dis confirm a belief  This creates the frame problem for the computational theory  because the relevance of a belief is not one of its local  syntactic properties but context dependent                         

Intentional realism edit 
In A Theory of Content and Other Essays         Fodor takes up another of his central notions  the question of the reality of mental representations  He sought to justify representational realism  so as to justify the idea that the contents of mental states are expressed in symbolic structures such as those of the LOT                         

Fodor s criticism of Dennett edit 
Fodor starts with some criticisms of so called standard realism  This view is characterized  according to Fodor  by two distinct assertions  One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non relational  The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts that there is an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs  Among modern philosophers of mind  the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false  but that the second is true  Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second             
In particular  Fodor criticizes the instrumentalism of Daniel Dennett              Dennett maintains that it is possible to be realist with regard to intentional states without having to commit oneself to the reality of mental representations              Now  according to Fodor  if one remains at this level of analysis  then there is no possibility of explaining why the intentional strategy works             

There is     a standard objection to instrumentalism      it is difficult to explain why the psychology of beliefs desires works so well  if the psychology of beliefs desires is  in fact  false     As Putnam  Boyd and others have emphasized  from the predictive successes of a theory to the truth of that theory there is surely a presumed inference  and this is even more likely when     we are dealing with the only theory in play which is predictively crowned with success  It is not obvious     why such a presumption should not militate in favour of a realist conception     of the interpretations of beliefs desires             
Productivity  systematicity and thought edit 
Building on Chomsky edit 
Fodor also has positive arguments in favour of the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT  He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic  then thoughts must also be systematic  Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism              Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts  productivity and compositionality             
Productivity is a representational system s unbounded ability to generate new representations from a given set of symbols  using its cognitive architecture   John    loves   and  Mary  allow for the construction of the sentences  John loves Mary  and  Mary loves John   Fodor s language of thought theorizes that representations are decomposable into constituent parts  and these decomposed representations are built into new strings             
More important than productivity is systematicity since it does not rely on questionable idealizations about human cognition  The argument states that a cognizer is able to understand some sentence in virtue of understanding another  For example  no one who understands  John loves Mary  is unable to understand  Mary loves John   and no one who understands  P and Q  is unable to understand  P   Systematicity itself is rarely challenged as a property of natural languages and logics  but some challenge that thought is systematic in the same way languages are              Still others from the connectionist tradition have tried to build non classical networks that can account for the apparent systematicity of language             
The fact that systematicity and productivity depend on the compositional structure of language means that language has a combinatorial semantics  If thought also has such a combinatorial semantics  then  Fodor stated  there must be a language of thought             

Formalizing thought processes edit 
The second argument that Fodor provides in favour of representational realism involves the processes of thought  This argument touches on the relation between the representational theory of mind and models of its architecture  If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type  The syntactic notion of mental representations goes hand in hand with the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the form of the symbols which they elaborate  And this is the computational theory of the mind  Consequently  the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations                         
For Fodor  this formal notion of thought processes also has the advantage of highlighting the parallels between the causal role of symbols and the contents which they express  In his view  syntax plays the role of mediation between the causal role of the symbols and their contents  The semantic relations between symbols can be  imitated  by their syntactic relations  The inferential relations which connect the contents of two symbols can be imitated by the formal syntax rules which regulate the derivation of one symbol from another             

The nature of content edit 
From the beginning of the     s  Fodor adhered to a causal notion of mental content and of meaning  This idea of content contrasts sharply with the inferential role semantics to which he subscribed earlier in his career  Fodor went on to criticize inferential role semantics  IRS  because its commitment to an extreme form of holism excludes the possibility of a true naturalization of the mental  But naturalization must include an explanation of content in atomistic and causal terms                         

Anti holism edit 
Fodor  while following W V O  Quine s confirmation holism  criticised semantic holism  the idea that every connection of a concept is part of its meaning              The identity of the content of a mental state  under semantic holism  can only be determined by the totality of its epistemic bonds  Fodor argued that this makes the realism of mental states an impossibility             

If people differ in an absolutely general way in their estimations of epistemic relevance  and if we follow the holism of meaning and individuate intentional states by way of the totality of their epistemic bonds  the consequence will be that two people  or  for that matter  two temporal sections of the same person  will never be in the same intentional state  Therefore  two people can never be subsumed under the same intentional generalizations  And  therefore  intentional generalization can never be successful  And  therefore again  there is no hope for an intentional psychology             
The asymmetric causal theory edit 
Having criticized the idea that semantic evaluation concerns only the internal relations between the units of a symbolic system  Fodor can adopt an externalist position with respect to mental content and meaning  For Fodor  later in his life  the problem of naturalization of the mental is tied to the possibility of giving  the sufficient conditions for which a piece of the world is relative to  expresses  represents  is true of  another piece  in non intentional and non semantic terms  If this goal is to be achieved within a representational theory of the mind  then the challenge is to devise a causal theory which can establish the interpretation of the primitive non logical symbols of the LOT  Fodor s initial proposal is that what determines that the symbol for  water  in Mentalese expresses the property H O is that the occurrences of that symbol are in certain causal relations with water  The intuitive version of this causal theory is what Fodor calls the  Crude Causal Theory   According to this theory  the occurrences of symbols express the properties which are the causes of their occurrence  The term  horse   for example  says of a horse that it is a horse  In order to do this  it is necessary and sufficient that certain properties of an occurrence of the symbol  horse  be in a law like relation with certain properties which determine that something is an occurrence of horse                         
The main problem with this theory is that of erroneous representations  There are two unavoidable problems with the idea that  a symbol expresses a property if it is     necessary that all and only the presences of such a property cause the occurrences   The first is that not all horses cause occurrences of horse  The second is that not only horses cause occurrences of horse  Sometimes the A horses  are caused by A  horses   but at other times when  for example  because of the distance or conditions of low visibility  one has confused a cow for a horse the A  horses  are caused by B  cows   In this case the symbol A doesn t express just the property A  but the disjunction of properties A or B  The crude causal theory is therefore incapable of distinguishing the case in which the content of a symbol is disjunctive from the case in which it isn t  This gives rise to what Fodor calls the  problem of disjunction                                      
Fodor responds to this problem with what he defines as  a slightly less crude causal theory   According to this approach  it is necessary to break the symmetry at the base of the crude causal theory  Fodor must find some criterion for distinguishing the occurrences of A caused by As  true  from those caused by Bs  false   The point of departure  according to Fodor  is that while the false cases are ontologically dependent on the true cases  the reverse is not true  There is an asymmetry of dependence  in other words  between the true contents  A  A  and the false ones  A A or B   The first can subsist independently of the second  but the second can occur only because of the existence of the first                         

From the point of view of semantics  errors must be accidents  if in the extension of  horse  there are no cows  then it cannot be required for the meaning of  horse  that cows be called horses  On the other hand  if  horse  did not mean that which it means  and if it were an error for horses  it would never be possible for a cow to be called  horse   Putting the two things together  it can be seen that the possibility of falsely saying  this is a horse  presupposes the existence of a semantic basis for saying it truly  but not vice versa  If we put this in terms of the crude causal theory  the fact that cows cause one to say  horse  depends on the fact that horses cause one to say  horse   but the fact that horses cause one to say  horse  does not depend on the fact that cows cause one to say  horse                
Functionalism edit 
During the     s  philosophers such as Donald Davidson  Hilary Putnam  and Fodor tried to resolve the puzzle of developing a way to preserve the explanatory efficacy of mental causation and folk psychology while adhering to a materialist vision of the world which did not violate the  generality of physics   Their proposal was  first of all  to reject the then dominant theories in philosophy of mind  behaviorism and the type identity theory              The problem with logical behaviorism was that it failed to account for causation between mental states and such causation seems to be essential to psychological explanation  especially if one considers that behavior is not an effect of a single mental event cause but is rather the effect of a chain of mental events causes  The type identity theory  on the other hand  failed to explain the fact that radically different physical systems can find themselves in the identical mental state  Besides being deeply anthropocentric  why should humans be the only thinking organisms in the universe    the identity type theory also failed to deal with accumulating evidence in the neurosciences that every single human brain is different from all the others  Hence  the impossibility of referring to common mental states in different physical systems manifests itself not only between different species but also between organisms of the same species             

An illustration of multiple realizability  M stands for mental and P stand for physical  The diagram shows that more than one P can instantiate one M  but not vice versa  Causal relations between states are represented by the arrows  M  goes to M   etc   
One can solve these problems  according to Fodor  with functionalism  a hypothesis which was designed to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism  What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it  The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental  Under this view  for example  I and a computer can both instantiate   realize   the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff  see graphic at right   On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism             

Evolution edit 
Fodor and the biolinguist Massimo Piattelli Palmarini co authored the book What Darwin Got Wrong                     In the same  the authors argue that much neo Darwinian literature is  distressingly uncritical  and that Charles Darwin s theory of evolution  overestimates the contribution the environment makes in shaping the phenotype of a species and correspondingly underestimates the effects of endogenous variables               Evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne describes this book as  a profoundly misguided critique of natural selection              and  as biologically uninformed as it is strident               Moral philosopher and anti scientism author Mary Midgley praises What Darwin Got Wrong as  an overdue and valuable onslaught on neo Darwinist simplicities               

Awards and honors edit 
Fodor was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  He received numerous awards and honors  New York State Regent s Fellowship  Woodrow Wilson Fellowship  Princeton University   Chancellor Greene Fellow  Princeton University   Fulbright Fellowship  University of Oxford   Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences  and a Guggenheim Fellowship              He won the first Jean Nicod Prize for philosophy of mind and cognitive philosophy in                   His lecture series for the Prize was published as The Elm and the Expert  Mentalese and Its Semantics                                 In            Fodor delivered the John Locke Lectures at the University of Oxford  titled Concepts  Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong  which went on to become a      book                          He also delivered the Patrick Romanell Lecture on Philosophical Naturalism                    and the Royce Lecture on Philosophy of Mind                    to the American Philosophical Association  of whose Eastern Division he served as President                          In       he won the Mind  amp  Brain Prize             

Criticism edit 
Philosophers of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor s ideas                                     

Simon Blackburn edit 
Simon Blackburn in Spreading the Word        has accused the language of thought hypothesis of falling prey to an infinite regress  If a person understands a word like  dog  through a mental representation which indicates that the word denotes dogs  then a regress takes place                          Fodor replies that the language of thought does not involve denoting things              On this view  the process of reasoning works directly to give a result but does not allow the person to examine how it works             

Daniel Dennett edit 
In       Daniel Dennett formulated another argument against the LOT  Dennett suggested that it would seem  on the basis of the evidence of our behavior toward computers but also with regard to some of our own unconscious behavior  that explicit representation is not necessary for the explanation of propositional attitudes  During a game of chess with a computer program  we often attribute such attitudes to the computer  saying such things as  It thinks that the queen should be moved to the left   We attribute propositional attitudes to the computer and this helps us to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts  Yet no one would suggest that the computer is actually thinking or believing somewhere inside its circuits the equivalent of the propositional attitude  I believe I can kick this guy s butt  in Mentalese  The same is obviously true  suggests Dennett  of many of our everyday automatic behaviors such as  desiring to breathe clear air  in a stuffy environment             

Kent Bach edit 
Linguists and philosophers of language such as Kent Bach have criticized Fodor s self proclaimed  extreme  concept nativism  Bach takes Fodor to task for his criticisms of lexical semantics and polysemy  Fodor claims that there is no lexical structure to such verbs as  keep    get    make  and  put   He suggests that  alternatively   keep  simply expresses the concept KEEP  Fodor capitalizes concepts to distinguish them from properties  names or other such entities   If there is a straightforward one to one mapping between individual words and concepts   keep your clothes on    keep your receipt  and  keep washing your hands  will all share the same concept of KEEP under Fodor s theory  This concept presumably locks on to the unique external property of keeping  But  if this is true  then RETAIN must pick out a different property in RETAIN YOUR RECEIPT  since one can t retain one s clothes on or retain washing one s hands  Fodor s theory also has a problem explaining how the concept FAST contributes  differently  to the contents of FAST CAR  FAST DRIVER  FAST TRACK  and FAST TIME              Whether or not the differing interpretations of  fast  in these sentences are specified in the semantics of English  or are the result of pragmatic inference  is a matter of debate              Fodor s own response to this kind of criticism is expressed bluntly in Concepts   People sometimes used to say that exist must be ambiguous because look at the difference between  chairs exist  and  numbers exist   A familiar reply goes  the difference between the existence of chairs and the existence of numbers seems  on reflection  strikingly like the difference between numbers and chairs  Since you have the latter to explain the former  you don t also need  exist  to be polysemic              
Some critics find it difficult to accept Fodor s insistence that a large  perhaps implausible  number of concepts are primitive and undefinable  For example  Fodor considers such concepts as EFFECT  ISLAND  TRAPEZOID  and WEEK to be all primitive  innate and unanalyzable because they all fall into the category of what he calls  lexical concepts   those for which our language has a single word   Against this view  Bach argues that the concept VIXEN is almost certainly composed out of the concepts FEMALE and FOX  BACHELOR out of SINGLE and MALE  and so on             

Fiona Cowie edit 
In her      book What s Within  Fiona Cowie argued against Fodor s innatist view  preferring a John Locke style empiricism  Fodor replied at length in a      article titled  Doing Without What s Within  Fiona Cowie s Critique of Nativism   stating that he was aiming at a position halfway between nativism and empiricism
