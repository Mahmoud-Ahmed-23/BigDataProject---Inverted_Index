							CAIRO  It seems that the Black Cloud phenomenon has become  not only part of our yearly rituals  but of our daily lives  
The first time the Black Cloud appeared was in the autumn of      and it       s been a recurrent phenomenon ever since  Breaking down the scientific factors causing it would be the first steps towards eradicating this annual air pollution climax 
One of these factors is a natural phenomenon  It involves a meteorological occurrence called        thermal inversion        whereby a warm air cap forms over Cairo  This air cap  however  neither rises nor subsides  hence trapping the air pollution instead of allowing it to disperse  
Other factors are man induced and include  industrial pollution caused by the fact that Cairo houses an estimate of        factories  transportation         the approximate number of vehicles on the streets of Cairo already surpassed the   million mark with an average increase of    percent annually  
Also  the burning of rice straw  which takes place every October  aggravates the problem especially when done in conjunction with the open air burning of garbage since there is no solid waste management system in place  
Although the Egyptian government has in recent years introduced measures to address the Black Cloud specifically and air pollution in general         such as promoting the use of natural gas as fuel for vehicles  factories and power plants and encouraging the recycling of rice straw instead of disposal through burning         the cloud still continues to appear and air pollution in general seems to be getting worse  
The reason for that is because the measures in place are insufficient and most lack proper enforcement  
A more holistic view of these measures and policies must be taken otherwise our environmental problems will continue to overshadow this country       s future    
Despite the fact that the current initiatives are heading in the right direction  they are merely the first installment of what needs to be done  A packaged policy framework that serves the goals of sustainable development is no longer an option  but a pressing necessity  
We need to look at problems related to the environment from a structural perspective  The government needs to be consistent with wanting to handle the pervasive environmental problems as part of achieving the overall well being of Egyptians 
With this in mind  economic  political and environmental policies all need to work in unison  This unfortunately is not the case as evident by the daily conflicts between what the government tries to achieve on the economic front and how that in turn affects environmental sustainability  
We need to start acting on the premise that economic growth cannot  and should not  overshadow environmental well being  Even though the government subscribes to this view in rhetoric  we are yet to find a harmonized policy framework that serves to turn the goals of sustainable development into reality  
While this is a long term policy view that cannot be realized overnight  there are other measures that could instigate the short term changes necessary for an overall change in the policy framework  
This will  however involve environmental activism  If citizens stand up and voice their discontent with the current levels of air pollution in the capital  this may set in motion the wheel of policy change  
Short term policy change would include added measures to address the levels of air pollution and more importantly  proper enforcement of those measures already in place  This will increase in the face of citizen pressure and the media attention that would ensue from environmental activism  
If the environmental activism that halted the Agrium plant in Dameitta earlier this year was so effective  isn       t it about time we saw such initiatives in the capital city
