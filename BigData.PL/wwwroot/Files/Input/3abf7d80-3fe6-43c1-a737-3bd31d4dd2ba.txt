Breathe in  And breathe out 
Walk into a yoga class  and one of the most recurrent themes of the class is the need to breathe in the energy from without and release the stress from within 
In Egypt s current unstable political and economic situation  where anxiety and stress are bubbling over  many Egyptians are turning to the ancient art as a means to step out of the daily grind and manage their emotions 
 Cairo is a very crowded place  and life is hectic in many ways   said Cairo based yogi Ayman Emad   But taking time off and practicing yoga and meditation helps in releasing the stress resulting from such a tiring life  
For Samar Yehia  another Cairene  coming to yoga is a way to quiet the energy draining mental chatter from an overcrowded lifestyle  And for her  like many  it is the breathing techniques taught to them in yoga that forms one of the most life changing aspects of their practice 
 What really differentiates yoga from physical sports is that it works on what I grew to call  the inner body  not just the outer body  through the connection between breath  movement  and mind   Yehia said   Although it is a full workout in its own right  it actually breeds inner flexibility with time  
With practice  Yehia said  yoga nurtures a        feeling of centeredness and closeness to oneself which brings with it a sense of acceptance and friendliness  
Yoga has become a quiet and still unrecognised seed of change for many who search within for personal strength and a deep seated spark of inspiration to deal with urban living 
Yehia said yoga has been essential in helping her to face the challenges that come with living in Egypt  whether it is Cairo s traffic  daily power cuts  the occasional petrol shortage  or even people s violent tempers and rising intolerance on the streets 
 I ve taken to practicing abdominal breathing while driving in heavy traffic to calm my nerves and keep my irritation in check   Yehia said   Immediately following a yoga class  I usually enjoy a sense of letting go and gently drifting with the flow of life  
Cairo based yogi Yusra Badr said practicing the patience required of flowing in and out of challenging yoga postures has given her new perspective of  patience  perspective and humility  in daily living 
 It taught me how to place matters and obstacles into their real size  and in reality  what seems to be a disaster is nothing more than a small hurdle of many   she said 
In a city where even the smallest fights tend to end as shouting matches involving a crowd  yoga has inspired Yusra to take a calmer and respectful approach 
She said she now feels like she has the tools to let go where a fight may have ensued 
 I guess it allows me to have a bird       s eye view on things         she said         With people  it augmented my preliminary tendencies to be nonjudgemental and to be objective about everything  
Nermeen Edrees  a Cairene who has practiced yoga for just over a year  agreed 
 I have noticed a change in dealing with certain situations  where I intentionally notice and deal with the anxiety attacks  which are much less frequent  when they hit   said Edrees  who works at an international bank in Cairo   I get angry still  but I acknowledge my anger and don t reveal much  and I actually now weigh things before I act or speak  I try to balance
