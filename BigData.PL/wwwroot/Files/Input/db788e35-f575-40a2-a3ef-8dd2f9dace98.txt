Records When There Is a Match in Either the Left or Right TableSELECT   FROM employeesFULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees department id   departments department id This query will retrieve all records from both the employees and departments tables  including unmatched records     CROSS JOIN  Retrieves the Cartesian Product of the Two TablesSELECT   FROM employeesCROSS JOIN departments This query will retrieve all possible combinations of records from the employees and departments tables     SELF JOIN  Joins a Table to ItselfSELECT e  first name  e  first nameFROM employees e   employees e WHERE e  employee id   e  manager id In this example  the employees table is joined to itself to find employees and their respective managers based on the manager id column SQL FunctionsIn this section we have compiled SQL cheat sheet for SQL functions  It is used for common tasks like aggregation  filtering  date time manipulation  and more     Scalar Functions  Functions That Return a Single ValueSELECT UPPER first name  AS upper case name FROM employees This query uses the UPPER   scalar function to convert the first name column values to uppercase     Aggregate Functions  Functions That Operate on a Set of Values and Return a Single ValueSELECT AVG salary  AS average salary FROM employees This query uses the AVG   aggregate function to calculate the average salary of all employees     String Functions  Functions That Manipulate String ValuesSELECT CONCAT first name       last name  AS full name FROM employees This query uses the CONCAT   string function to concatenate the first name and last name columns into a single column called full name SELECT SUBSTR first name        AS short name FROM employees This query uses the SUBSTR   function to extract the first three characters of the first name column for each employee  The result is displayed in a new column called short name SELECT INSERT full name         Amazing    AS modified name FROM  SELECT CONCAT first name       last name  AS full name FROM employees  AS employee names This query first concatenates the first name and last name columns into a single column called full name  Then  it uses the INSERT   function to insert the string  Amazing   at the  th position of the full name column for each employee  The modified names are displayed in a new column called modified name     Date and Time Functions  Functions That Operate on Date and Time ValuesSELECT CURRENT DATE AS current date FROM dual This query uses the CURRENT DATE date function to retrieve the current date     Mathematical Functions  Functions That Perform Mathematical OperationsSELECT SQRT     AS square root FROM dual This query uses the SQRT   mathematical function to calculate the square root of    Subqueries in SQL This SQL cheat sheet explains how to nest queries for powerful data filtering and manipulation within a single statement     Single row Subquery  Returns One Row of ResultSELECT first name  last nameFROM employeesWHERE salary    SELECT MAX salary  FROM employees  In this example  the subquery  SELECT MAX salary  FROM employees  returns a single row containing the maximum salary  and it s used to filter employees who have the maximum salary     Multiple row Subquery  Returns Multiple Rows of ResultSELECT department nameFROM departmentsWHERE department id IN  SELECT department id FROM employees  In this example  the subquery  SELECT department id FROM employees  returns multiple rows containing department IDs  and it s used to filter department names based on those IDs     Correlated Subquery  References a Column from the Outer QuerySELECT first name  last nameFROM employees eWHERE salary  gt   SELECT AVG salary  FROM employees WHERE department   e department  In this example  the subquery  SELECT AVG salary  FROM employees WHERE department   e department  is correlated with the outer query by referencing the department column from the outer query  It calculates the average salary for each department and is used to filter employees whose salary is greater than the average salary of their respective department     Nested Subquery  A Subquery Inside Another SubquerySELECT first name  last nameFROM employeesWHERE department id IN      SELECT department id    FROM departments    WHERE department name    IT   In this example  the subquery  SELECT department id FROM departments WHERE department name    IT   is nested within the outer query  It retrieves the department ID for the IT department  which is then used in the outer query to filter employees belonging to the IT department Views in SQL Here in this SQL cheat sheet unveils how to create virtual tables based on existing data for streamlined access     CREATE VIEW  Create a Virtual Table Based on the Result of a SELECT QueryCREATE VIEW high paid employees ASSELECT  FROM employeesWHERE salary  gt        This query creates a views named high paid employees that contains all employees with a salary greater than           DROP VIEW  Delete a ViewDROP VIEW IF EXISTS high paid employees This query drops the high paid employees view if it exists Indexes in SQL Speed up your SQL queries with our Indexes Cheat Sheet  Learn how to create and optimize indexes to dramatically improve database performance     CREATE INDEX  Create an Index on a TableCREATE INDEX idx department ON employees  department  This query creates an index named idx department on the department column of the employees table     DROP INDEX  Remove an IndexDROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx department This query drops the idx department index if it exists Transactions in SQL Learn how to manage groups of database operations as a single unit for reliable data updates     BEGIN TRANSACTION  Start a New TransactionBEGIN TRANSACTION This statement starts a new transaction     COMMIT  Save Changes Made During the Current TransactionCOMMIT This statement saves all changes made during the current transaction     ROLLBACK  Undo Changes Made During the Current TransactionROLLBACK This statement undoes all changes made during the current transaction Advanced Mixed Data in SQL In the last we have complied all the imprtant queries under the one advanced SQL cheat sheet      Stored Procedures  Precompiled SQL Statements That Can Be Executed with a Single CommandCREATE PROCEDURE get employee count  BEGIN  SELECT COUNT    FROM employees END This query creates a stored procedure named get employee count that returns the count of employees     Triggers  Automatically Execute a Set of SQL Statements When a Specified Event OccursCREATE TRIGGER before employee insertBEFORE INSERT ON employeesFOR EACH ROWBEGIN  SET NEW creation date   NOW   END This query creates a trigger named before employee insert that sets the creation date column to the current date and time before inserting a new employee record     User defined Functions  UDFs   Custom SQL Functions Created by Users to Perform Specific TasksCREATE FUNCTION calculate bonus salary DECIMAL  RETURNS DECIMALBEGIN  RETURN salary               bonusEND This query creates a user defined function named calculate bonus that calculates the bonus based on the salary     Common Table Expressions  CTEs   Temporary Result Sets That Can Be Referenced Within a SELECT  INSERT  UPDATE  or DELETE StatementWITH high paid employees AS    SELECT   FROM employees WHERE salary  gt        SELECT   FROM high paid employees This query uses a common table expression named high paid employees to retrieve all employees with a salary greater than       SQL Cheat Sheet PDFDownload SQL CheatSheet ConclusionThis SQL cheat sheet provide a wide range of commands and techniques essential for effective database management and data
