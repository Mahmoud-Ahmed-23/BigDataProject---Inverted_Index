Wisdom  also known as sapience  is the ability to apply knowledge  experience  and good judgment to navigate life s complexities  It is often associated with insight  discernment  and ethics in decision making  Throughout history  wisdom has been regarded as a key virtue in philosophy  religion  and psychology  representing the ability to understand and respond to reality in a balanced and thoughtful manner  Unlike intelligence  which primarily concerns problem solving and reasoning  wisdom involves a deeper comprehension of human nature  moral principles  and the long term consequences of actions 
Philosophically  wisdom has been explored by thinkers from Ancient Greece to modern times  Socrates famously equated wisdom with recognizing one s own ignorance  while Aristotle saw it as practical reasoning  phronesis  and deep contemplation  sophia   Eastern traditions  such as Confucianism and Buddhism  emphasize wisdom as a form of enlightened understanding that leads to ethical living and inner peace  Across cultures  wisdom is often linked to virtues like humility  patience  and compassion  suggesting that it is not just about knowing what is right but also acting upon it 
Psychologists study wisdom as a cognitive and emotional trait  often linking it to maturity  emotional regulation  and the ability to consider multiple perspectives  Research suggests that wisdom is associated with qualities such as open mindedness  empathy  and the ability to manage uncertainty  Some psychological models  such as the Berlin Wisdom Paradigm and Robert Sternberg s Balance Theory  attempt to define and measure wisdom through various cognitive and social factors  Neuroscience studies also explore how brain structures related to emotional processing and long term thinking contribute to wise decision making 
Wisdom continues to be a subject of interest in modern society  influencing fields as diverse as leadership  education  and personal development  While technology provides greater access to information  it does not necessarily lead to wisdom  which requires careful reflection and ethical consideration  As artificial intelligence and data driven decision making play a growing role in shaping human life  discussions on wisdom remain relevant  emphasizing the importance of judgment  ethical responsibility  and long term planning

Historical overview edit 
Wisdom has been a central concept in philosophy  religion  and literature across ancient civilizations 
The earliest wisdom literature comes from Sumerian and Egyptian texts  In Sumerian tradition  wisdom  me  was considered a divine principle given by the gods  recorded in proverbs and myths             Egyptian wisdom texts  such as the Maxims of Ptahhotep  c       BCE   emphasized moral conduct and social harmony            
Wisdom became a major theme in Greek philosophy  Socrates equated wisdom with knowing one s own ignorance  while Plato argued that wisdom was the highest form of knowledge              Aristotle distinguished between practical wisdom  phronesis  and theoretical wisdom  sophia   defining wisdom as the ability to deliberate well about the good life             
In Roman philosophy  wisdom  sapientia  was regarded as the virtue of the Stoic sage  Cicero and Seneca viewed wisdom as self discipline and rational living  essential for achieving inner tranquility  ataraxia              
Wisdom also developed as a spiritual concept in various traditions 

Biblical wisdom literature  Books like Proverbs  Ecclesiastes  and Job depict wisdom as both divine and practical  often contrasting human knowledge with divine omniscience             
Buddhism  Wisdom  praj    is one of the threefold trainings leading to enlightenment  developed through meditation and ethical conduct

Socrates edit 
According to Plato and Xenophon  the Pythia of the Delphic Oracle answered the question  who is the wisest man in Greece   by stating Socrates was the wisest              According to Plato s Apology  Socrates          BCE  decided to investigate the people who might be considered wiser than him  concluding they lacked true knowledge  He argued that true wisdom involves questioning and refining beliefs rather than assuming certainty 






                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               




I am wiser than this man  for neither of us really knows anything fine and good  but this man thinks he knows something when he does not  whereas I  as I do not know anything  do not think I do either 



This became immortalized in the phrase  I know that I know nothing   an aphorism suggesting that it is wise to recognize one s own ignorance             and to value epistemic humility             

Plato and Aristotle edit 
To Socrates and his student Plato  c          BCE   philosophy was literally the love of wisdom  philo sophia   This permeates Plato s dialogues  in The Republic the leaders of his proposed utopia are philosopher kings who  through education and contemplation  attain a deep understanding of justice and the Forms  and possess the courage to act accordingly             
Aristotle          BCE   in Metaphysics  defined wisdom as understanding why things are a certain way  causality   which is deeper than merely knowing things are a certain way  was the first to differentiate between two types of wisdom 

Theoretical wisdom  sophia   which involves deep contemplation of universal truths 
Practical wisdom  phronesis   which is the ability to make sound decisions in everyday life 
Aristotle saw phronesis as essential for ethical living  arguing that virtuous actions require both knowledge and experience  This concept of practical wisdom later influenced virtue ethics and modern discussions of decision making             

Medieval and Renaissance thought edit 
In the Medieval period  wisdom was often linked to divine revelation and theology  Augustine of Hippo          CE  viewed wisdom as knowledge aligned with God s eternal truth  distinguishing it from mere worldly intelligence              He argued that true wisdom  sapientia  comes from knowing and loving God  contrasting it with human knowledge  scientia   which concerns temporal matters             
Thomas Aquinas             built upon Aristotle s distinction between theoretical and practical wisdom  incorporating it into Christian theology  He argued that wisdom  sapientia  is the highest intellectual virtue  guiding reason toward ultimate truth and divine understanding              Aquinas distinguished between natural wisdom  which humans acquire through reason  and supernatural wisdom  which comes through divine revelation             
During the Renaissance  humanist thinkers such as Erasmus             and Montaigne             emphasized the role of self reflection and skepticism in wisdom  challenging dogmatic reliance on authority              Montaigne  in his Essays  proposed that true wisdom lies in acknowledging uncertainty and maintaining intellectual humility              The Renaissance emphasis on human reason and critical inquiry laid the groundwork for early modern philosophical discussions of wisdom 

Modern and contemporary philosophy edit 
In the Age of Enlightenment  the concept of wisdom shifted from religious and metaphysical frameworks to one rooted in rationality and moral duty  Immanuel Kant             argued that wisdom involves the application of practical reason to align one s actions with universal moral principles              He distinguished between theoretical reason  which seeks knowledge for its own sake  and practical reason  which applies knowledge ethically  Kantian wisdom involves making decisions that conform to the categorical imperative  a moral law derived from reason 
During the   th century  romanticism and existentialism challenged the rationalist foundations of wisdom  Friedrich Nietzsche             criticized traditional views of wisdom as passive contemplation and obedience to moral codes  Instead  he championed  life affirming wisdom   emphasizing personal growth through struggle and self overcoming              Nietzsche rejected the pursuit of static truths  instead advocating for a dynamic and self created form of wisdom 
Existentialist philosophers further expanded this critique  Jean Paul Sartre             viewed wisdom as a confrontation with the absurd condition of life and the freedom to create meaning in a world devoid of inherent purpose              Albert Camus             echoed these ideas in The Myth of Sisyphus  arguing that wisdom lies in accepting life s absurdity and choosing to live meaningfully despite its challenges             
In the   th century  pragmatist philosophers like John Dewey             argued for a form of wisdom based on adaptability and practical decision making  Dewey rejected fixed moral absolutes in favor of wisdom as a constantly evolving process of inquiry and experimentation              Pragmatic wisdom  according to Dewey  emerges from ongoing reflection on experience and the ability to adapt principles to changing contexts 
Meanwhile  virtue ethicists such as Martha Nussbaum argue that wisdom is tied to emotional intelligence and empathy  In her works on Aristotelian ethics  Nussbaum writes that wise individuals understand the complexities of human emotions and integrate them into moral reasoning              This perspective sees wisdom not merely as intellectual discernment but as the capacity to recognize the emotional and contextual dimensions of moral life 
Postmodern philosophers challenge the notion of wisdom as a universal concept  Michel Foucault             argued that ideas of wisdom are shaped by power structures and are inherently subjective  often serving to reinforce dominant ideologies              Postmodern perspectives emphasize cultural relativism and the diversity of wisdom across historical and social contexts rather than a singular definition 
Today  contemporary discussions of wisdom draw from cognitive science and social philosophy  Philosophers like Philip Kitcher focus on practical wisdom as collaborative decision making in democratic societies              This view holds that wisdom is not an individual trait but a collective process involving diverse perspectives  As such  modern philosophy views wisdom as dynamic  context dependent  and shaped by emotional  social  and cognitive factors

In Confucian thought  wisdom  zhi     is closely linked to ethical living and social harmony  Confucius          BCE  taught that wisdom is not merely intelligence but the ability to act virtuously in relationships and governance              It involves self cultivation  learning from the past  and practicing benevolence  ren      which Confucius regarded as a foundational virtue            
Wisdom in Confucianism is practical and moral  requiring individuals to cultivate righteousness  yi     and ritual propriety  li     in order to contribute to a stable society              The ideal wise person  or  superior person   junzi       embodies wisdom by continuously refining their character and aligning their actions with ethical principles             
Later Confucian thinkers expanded on this concept  Mencius          BCE  emphasized compassion and moral intuition as sources of wisdom  arguing that humans are naturally inclined toward goodness but must develop wisdom through education and reflection              Xunzi  c          BCE   by contrast  saw wisdom as the product of strict discipline and adherence to ritual  believing that human nature is inherently flawed and must be shaped through deliberate effort             
The Confucian approach to wisdom remains influential in East Asian ethics  education  and leadership philosophy  continuing to shape modern discussions on morality and governance

In Buddhist philosophy  wisdom  praj             is one of the threefold training principles  along with ethics and meditation   It involves seeing reality as it truly is  free from delusions  In Mahayana Buddhism  wisdom is often personified by the Bodhisattva Manjushri  who wields a sword to cut through ignorance  Zen traditions emphasize satori       a sudden flash of wisdom or enlightenment  In Therav da Buddhism  wisdom is developed through vipassan   insight meditation   leading to the realization of impermanence  anicca   suffering  du kha   and non self  anatt    Buddhist religious traditions provide comprehensive guidance on how to develop wisdom                         
The term Praj   was translated into Chinese as
    pinyin zh hu   characters    knowledge  and    bright  intelligent    In Chinese Buddhism  the idea of wisdom is closely linked to its Indian equivalent as it appears for instance in certain conceptual continuities that exist between Asanga  Vasubandhu and Xuanzang      further explanation needed                 
Developing wisdom is of central importance in Buddhist traditions  where the ultimate aim is often presented as  seeing things as they are  or as gaining a  penetrative understanding of all phenomena   which in turn is described as ultimately leading to the  complete freedom from suffering                           In Buddhism  developing wisdom is accomplished through an understanding of what are known as the Four Noble Truths and by following the Noble Eightfold Path                          This path lists mindfulness as one of eight required components for cultivating wisdom             
Buddhist scriptures teach that wise people conduct themselves well              A wise person does actions that are unpleasant to do but give good results  and does not do actions that are pleasant to do but give bad results              Wisdom is the antidote to the poison of ignorance  The Buddha has much to say on the subject of wisdom including 

He who arbitrates a case by force does not thereby become just  established in Dhamma   But the wise man is he who carefully discriminates between right and wrong             
He who leads others by nonviolence  righteously and equitably  is indeed a guardian of justice  wise and righteous             
One is not wise merely because he talks much  But he who is calm  free from hatred and fear  is verily called a wise man             
By quietude alone one does not become a sage  muni  if he is foolish and ignorant  But he who  as if holding a pair of scales  takes the good and shuns the evil  is a wise man  he is indeed a muni by that very reason  He who understands both good and evil as they really are  is called a true sage

In Hindu philosophy edit 
Main article  Hindu philosophy
In Hindu philosophy  wisdom  j  na         is closely associated with self realization and spiritual knowledge  Unlike the empirical knowledge  vidy           gained through sensory experience  wisdom in Hinduism involves insight into the ultimate nature of reality  Brahman            and the self   tman                      The Upanishads  foundational texts of Hindu thought  describe wisdom as the realization that all worldly distinctions are illusions  maya         and that the self is one with the infinite consciousness of Brahman             
Within Vedanta philosophy  wisdom is considered the path to liberation  mok a          Adi Shankaracharya  c   th century CE  argued that true wisdom  jnana yoga  arises through discrimination  viveka         between the real and the unreal              He taught that ignorance  avidy            binds individuals to the cycle of samsara  rebirth   and wisdom is the means to overcome illusion and attain self realization              In contrast  Dvaita Vedanta  founded by Madhvacharya    th century CE   holds that wisdom involves recognizing the eternal distinction between the self and God  rather than dissolving all distinctions             
Wisdom is also a core element in Hindu sacred texts  including the Bhagavad Gita  where Krishna teaches Arjuna that true wisdom transcends personal desires and emotions              The Gita outlines three paths to wisdom 

Jnana yoga   the path of intellectual discernment and self inquiry 
Bhakti yoga   the path of devotion to a personal deity as a means to wisdom 
Karma yoga   the path of selfless action leading to enlightened understanding             
Hindu wisdom traditions remain deeply influential in both spiritual practice and philosophical inquiry  with modern thinkers like Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo Ghose integrating ancient wisdom concepts with contemporary thought              Medha is a goddess of wisdom found in the Garuda Purana

Taoist views of wisdom  wu wei      emphasizes effortless action  aligning with the natural flow of the universe  Tao   While early Confucianism values social harmony and structured virtue  Taoist wisdom often embraces paradox and non conformity  The Zhuangzi text  attributed to Zhuang Zhou  c   th century BCE   presents wisdom as a state of effortless flow  wu wei   where one aligns with the spontaneous patterns of nature rather than imposing human will              This contrasts with Confucian ideals of ritual and duty  as Taoist wisdom values freedom from rigid thinking and acceptance of change             
Taoist wisdom also includes cosmological insight  recognizing that all things emerge from the Tao      the fundamental force of existence              In Tao Te Ching        attributed to Laozi   th century BCE   wisdom is described as yielding like water  able to overcome obstacles through gentleness rather than force              This perspective aligns with Taoist ethics  which discourage aggression and rigid control  instead promoting a harmonious existence in sync with nature s rhythms              He also describes wisdom as understanding the balance of opposites  Yin and Yang  and acting in harmony with nature rather than imposing force             
Unlike Western views  Taoist wisdom often involves paradox and non action  valuing spontaneity over rigid rules  Taoist sages are often depicted as detached from worldly concerns  seeking a deeper  wordless understanding of existence that transcends conventional logic             

Psychological perspectives edit 
Main article  Expert
Further information  Developmental psychology and personality psychology
The three major psychological categories for wisdom are personality  development  and expertise             
Psychologists have begun to gather data on commonly held beliefs or folk theories about wisdom              Initial analyses indicate that although  there is an overlap of the implicit theory of wisdom with intelligence  perceptiveness  spirituality  and shrewdness  it is evident that wisdom is an expertise in dealing with difficult questions of life and adaptation to the complex requirements              
The field of psychology has also developed explicit theories and empirical research on the psychological processes underlying wisdom                          Opinions on the psychological definition of wisdom vary              but there is some consensus that critical to wisdom are certain meta cognitive processes that afford life reflection and judgment about critical life matters                          These processes include recognizing the limits of one s own knowledge  acknowledging uncertainty and change  attention to context and the bigger picture  and integrating different perspectives of a situation              Cognitive scientists suggest that wisdom requires coordinating such reasoning processes for insight into managing one s life              Reasoning of this sort is both theoretically and empirically distinct from general  fluid or crystallized  intelligence              Researchers have shown empirically that wise reasoning is distinct from IQ             
Baltes and colleagues defined wisdom as  the ability to deal with the contradictions of a specific situation and to assess the consequences of an action for themselves and for others  It is achieved when in a concrete situation  a balance between intrapersonal  interpersonal and institutional interests can be prepared               Balance appears to be a critical criterion of wisdom  Empirical research provides some support for this idea  showing that wisdom related reasoning is associated with achieving balance between intrapersonal and interpersonal interests when facing personal life challenges  and when setting goals for managing interpersonal conflicts                         
Researchers also explore the role of emotions in wisdom              Most agree that emotions and emotion regulation are key to effectively managing the kinds of complex and arousing situations that most call for wisdom  Much empirical research has focused on the cognitive or meta cognitive aspects of wisdom  assuming that an ability to reason through difficult situations is paramount  So although emotions likely play a role in how wisdom plays out in real events  and in reflecting on past events   empirical studies were late to develop on how emotions affect a person s ability to deal wisely with complex events  One study found a positive relationship between diversity of emotional experience and wise reasoning  irrespective of emotional intensity             

Gestalt therapy edit 
Main article  Gestalt therapy
A wise person fantasy is an awareness intervention  where one poses a question  thinks on it for a few minutes  and then role plays a fantasized wise person to answer that same question             

Grossman edit 
Grossmann and colleagues summarized prior psychological literature to conclude that wisdom involves certain cognitive processes that afford unbiased  sound judgment in the face of ill defined life situations 

intellectual humility  or recognition of limits of own knowledge
appreciation of perspectives broader than the issue at hand
sensitivity to the possibility of change in social relations
compromise or integration of different perspectives                        
Grossmann found that habitually speaking and thinking of oneself in the third person increases these characteristics  which means that such a habit makes a person wiser              Grossmann says contextual factors                  such as culture  experiences  and social situations                  influence the understanding  development  and propensity of wisdom  with implications for training and educational practice                          These contextual factors are the focus of continuing research  For instance  Grossmann and Kross identified a phenomenon they called  the Solomon s paradox   that people reflect more wisely on other people s problems than on their own   It is named after King Solomon  who had legendary sagacity when making judgments about other people s dilemmas but lacked insight when it came to important decisions in his own life              

Measuring wisdom edit 
A researcher will measure wisdom differently depending on their theoretical position about the nature of wisdom  For example  some view wisdom as a stable personality trait  others as a context bound process              Those wedded to the former approach often use single shot questionnaires  which are prone to biased     clarification needed      responses                          something that is antithetical to the wisdom construct             and fails to study wisdom in the contexts where it is most relevant  complex life challenges  In contrast  researchers who prefer the latter approach measure wisdom related features of cognition  motivation  and emotion in the context of a specific situation                          Such state level measures provide less biased responses as well as greater power in explaining meaningful psychological processes              Also  a focus on the situation allows wisdom researchers to develop a fuller understanding of the role of context in producing wisdom              For example  studies have shown evidence of cross cultural             and within cultural variability              and systematic variability in reasoning wisely across contexts                         and in daily life             
Many  but not all  studies find that adults  self ratings of perspective and wisdom do not depend on age                                      This conflicts with the popular notion that wisdom increases with age              The answer to whether age and wisdom correlate depends on how one defines wisdom and one s experimental technique  The answer to this question also depends on the domain studied  and the role of experience in that domain  with some contexts favoring older adults  others favoring younger adults  and some not differentiating age groups              Rigorous longitudinal work is needed to answer this question  while most studies rely on cross sectional observations             
The Jeste Thomas Wisdom Index             is based on a    question survey  SD WISE     created by researchers at the University of California San Diego to determine how wise a person is  In      Dr  Dilip V  Jeste and his colleagues created a   question survey  SD WISE    testing seven components  acceptance of diverse perspectives  decisiveness  emotional regulation  prosocial behaviors  self reflection  social advising  and  to a lesser degree  spirituality

In Hellenistic religion  wisdom was often personified as a divine or mystical force guiding human understanding  In Greek mystery religions  particularly Orphism and the Eleusinian Mysteries  wisdom was associated with spiritual enlightenment and initiation into hidden truths               Philosophical movements such as Neoplatonism developed a concept of wisdom  sophia         as the knowledge of the divine order of existence  Plotinus          CE  viewed wisdom as an ascent of the soul towards the One  the ultimate source of all reality               In this tradition  wisdom was both intellectual and mystical  requiring inner purification to grasp transcendent truths 
Wisdom also played a central role in Gnosticism  an esoteric movement that emerged in the first few centuries CE  Gnostics saw wisdom  Sophia  as a divine figure  often depicted as a fallen being who sought to restore humanity s knowledge of its divine origin  In texts in the Nag Hammadi library  Sophia is described as the mother of all living and the source of gnosis  spiritual knowledge                According to Valentinian Gnosticism  Sophia s fall led to the creation of the material world  but through wisdom  the soul could transcend illusion and return to the divine realm              
Gnostic texts such as the Pistis Sophia depict wisdom as a cosmic force struggling to free itself from ignorance and darkness  This contrasts with orthodox Christian views  where wisdom         is associated with the Logos and divine order rather than cosmic dualism               In Hermeticism  another esoteric tradition of the Hellenistic period  wisdom was linked to inner enlightenment and mystical union with the divine mind  nous                      These traditions  though diverse  shared the belief that wisdom was the key to transcending material existence and reuniting with the divine

King Solomon continues his teachings of wisdom in the book of Ecclesiastes  Solomon discusses his exploration of the meaning of life and fulfillment  as he speaks of life s pleasures  work  and materialism  yet concludes that it is all meaningless    Meaningless  Meaningless   says the Teacher  Solomon    Utterly meaningless  Everything is meaningless    For with much wisdom comes much sorrow  the more knowledge  the more grief               Solomon concludes that all life s pleasures and riches  and even  human wisdom  mean nothing if there is no relationship with God
