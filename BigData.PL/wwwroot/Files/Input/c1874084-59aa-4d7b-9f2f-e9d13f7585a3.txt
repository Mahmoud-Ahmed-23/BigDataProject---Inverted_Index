History
Main article  History of Fox News
In May       Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch announced that he and American industrialist and philanthropist Marvin Davis intended to develop  a network of independent stations as a fourth marketing force  to directly compete with CBS  NBC  and ABC through the purchase of six television stations owned by Metromedia              In July         th Century Fox announced Murdoch had completed his purchase of     of Fox Filmed Entertainment  the parent company of   th Century Fox Film Corporation             
Subsequently  and prior to founding FNC  Murdoch had gained experience in the    hour news business when News Corporation s BSkyB subsidiary began Europe s first    hour news channel  Sky News  in the United Kingdom in                   With the success of his efforts establishing Fox as a TV network in the United States                          experience gained from Sky News and the turnaround of   th Century Fox  Murdoch announced on January           that News Corp  would launch a    hour news channel on cable and satellite systems in the United States as part of a News Corp   worldwide platform  for Fox programming   The appetite for news        particularly news that explains to people how it affects them        is expanding enormously              
In February       after former U S  Republican Party political strategist and NBC executive             Roger Ailes left cable television channel America s Talking  now MSNBC   Murdoch asked him to start Fox News Channel  Ailes demanded five months of    hour workdays and several weeks of rehearsal shows before its launch on October                    
At its debut    million households were able to watch FNC              however  it was absent from the largest U S  media markets of New York City and Los Angeles  Rolling news coverage during the day consisted of    minute single topic shows such as Fox on Crime or Fox on Politics  surrounded by news headlines  Interviews featured facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest  The flagship newscast at the time was The Schneider Report  with Mike Schneider s fast paced delivery of the news  During the evening  Fox featured opinion shows  The O Reilly Report  later The O Reilly Factor   The Crier Report  hosted by Catherine Crier  and Hannity  amp  Colmes  From the beginning  FNC has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation  Graphics were designed to be colorful and gain attention  this helped the viewer to grasp the main points of what was being said  even if they could not hear the host  with on screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker  and  bullet points  when a host was delivering commentary   Fox News also created the  Fox News Alert   which interrupted its regular programming when a breaking news story occurred      citation needed

To accelerate its adoption by cable providers  Fox News paid systems up to     per subscriber to distribute the channel              This contrasted with the normal practice  in which cable operators paid stations carriage fees for programming  When Time Warner bought Ted Turner s Turner Broadcasting System  a federal antitrust consent decree required Time Warner to carry a second all news channel in addition to its own CNN on its cable systems  Time Warner selected MSNBC as the secondary news channel  not Fox News  Fox News claimed this violated an agreement  to carry Fox News   Citing its agreement to keep its U S  headquarters and a large studio in New York City  News Corporation enlisted the help of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani s administration to pressure Time Warner Cable  one of the city s two cable providers  to transmit Fox News on a city owned channel              City officials threatened to take action affecting Time Warner s cable franchises in the city             
During the September          attacks  Fox News was the first news organization to run a news ticker on the bottom of the screen to keep up with the flow of information that day  The ticker has remained  and has proven popular with viewers              In January       Fox News surpassed CNN in ratings for the first time             
In       The Economist reported that Murdoch had  ditched a plan  to remerge News Corporation with Fox because it  faced resistance from News Corp investors unhappy at the prospect of being lumped together with Fox News  which they consider a toxic brand               Later that year  Murdoch said he would step down and that his son Lachlan would take over both Fox Corporation and News Corp

On the night of October           Fox set a record for its highest rated telecast  with           million viewers for the third U S  presidential debate                          In prime time the week before  Fox averaged almost          million viewers with a total day average of           million viewers             
In prime time and total day ratings for the week of April    to           Fox News  propelled by its coverage of the Boston Marathon bombing  was the highest ranked network on U S  cable television  for the first time since August       when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States              January      marked Fox News s    th consecutive month as the highest rated cable news channel  During that month  Fox News beat CNN and MSNBC combined in overall viewers in both prime time hours and the total day               In the third quarter of       the network was the most watched cable channel during prime time hours               During the final week of the campaign for the United States elections        Fox News had the highest ratings of any cable channel  news or otherwise  On election night itself  Fox News  coverage had higher ratings than that of any of the other five cable or network news sources among viewers between    and    years of age               The network hosted the first prime time GOP candidates  forum of the      campaign on August    The debate reached a record breaking    million viewers  by far the largest audience for any cable news event              
A      study by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet  amp  Society at Harvard University found that Fox News was the third most shared source among supporters of Donald Trump on Twitter during the      presidential election  behind The Hill and Breitbart News                           
In       Fox News was rated by Nielsen as America s most watched cable network  averaging a record          million viewers in prime time and total day during the period of January   to December                        In an October      Simmons Research survey of the trust in    news organizations  Fox News was ranked roughly in the center  with       of surveyed Americans saying they trusted it              
The COVID    pandemic led to increased viewership for all cable news networks  For the first calendar quarter of       January     March      Fox News had their highest rated quarter in the network s history  with Nielsen showing a prime time average total audience of            million viewers  Sean Hannity s program  Hannity  weeknights at        pm ET was the top rated show in cable news for the quarter averaging          million viewers  a figure that not only beat out all of its cable news competition but also placed it ahead of network competition in the same time slot  Fox ended the quarter with the top five shows in prime time  with Fox s Tucker Carlson Tonight finishing the quarter in second overall with an average audience of          million viewers  followed by The Five  The Ingraham Angle  and Special Report with Bret Baier  The Rachel Maddow Show was the highest non Fox show on cable  coming in sixth place  Finishing the quarter in   nd place was The Lead with Jake Tapper  CNN s highest rated show               According to a Fox News article on the subject  Fox  amp  Friends averaged          million viewers  topping CNN s New Day and MSNBC s Morning Joe combined  The same Fox News article said that the Fox Business Network also had its highest rated quarter in history and that Fox News finished March as the highest rated network in cable for the   th consecutive month              
According to the Los Angeles Times on August            Fox News Channel had six of last week s    highest rated prime time programs to finish first in the network ratings race for the third time since June                    
A Morning Consult survey the week after Election Day      showed    percent of Republicans in the United States had an unfavorable opinion of Fox News  while    percent of Republicans viewed the network favorably  compared to    percent before the election  A McClatchy news story suggested criticism from Donald Trump as a major reason  as well as the network s early calling of Arizona for Joe Biden  and later joining other networks in declaring Biden the winner of the      election              
Ratings were also down for Fox News  Although it remained ahead of other networks overall  its morning show fell out of first place for the first time since       Trump recommended OANN  which was gaining viewers  Newsmax was also increasing in popularity              
Following a decline in ratings post      U S  presidential election  in       Fox News regained its lead in cable news ratings ahead of CNN and MSNBC                           

Demographics
As indicated by a      New York Times article  based on Nielsen statistics  Fox appears to have a mostly aged demographic               In March       Fox was the most watched news network in total day and prime time viewers in primetime  with       million       million viewers respectively  compared to MSNBC with A      demo        million in primetime and         in day viewers  and CNN with         in primetime and         in day viewers  In the Adults age       category  Fox also leads with         in primetime and         in day viewers  followed by MSNBC with         viewers in primetime and        viewers in day  and CNN with         viewers in primetime and        in day viewers               According to the same Nielsen analysis  MSNBC is the second most watched news network 
In       in the       age group  Fox News had an average of         viewers  but dropped to         in      while increasing its overall audience from           million in      to           million in       The median age of a prime time viewer was    as of          update                    A      Pew Research Center survey showed that among those who named Fox News as their main source for political news      are aged    or older              
According to a      Gallup poll      of Fox viewers  either identify as or lean Republican                The      Pew survey showed that among people who named Fox News as their main source for political and election news      identify as Republicans  Among the top eight political news sources named by at least    of American adults  the results show Fox News and MSNBC as the two news channels with the most partisan audiences              

Wikipedia consensus on reliability
In       the Wikipedia community had its first major discussion on Fox News  reliability  The community decided that Fox News was politically biased  but generally reliable              
In July       the Wikipedia community announced that Fox News would no longer be considered  generally reliable  in its reporting of science and politics  and that it  should be used with caution to verify contentious claims  for those topics                            The decision was made due to Fox News downplaying the COVID    pandemic  as well as allegations of Fox News spreading misinformation about climate change and reporting on the false concept of  no go zones  for non Muslims in British cities  The decision did not affect Fox News  reliability on other topics              
In       the Wikipedia community announced that Fox News would now be considered  marginally reliable  in its reporting of science and politics  that Fox News cannot be used as a source for  exceptional claims   and that its reliability would be decided on an individual case by case basis for other scientific and political claims  The decision only applies to news articles on Fox News  website and does not apply to Fox News articles about topics that are not scientific or political              
Fox News is considered a generally unreliable source for its scientific and political coverage and its talk shows                           

Slogan
Fox News Channel originally used the slogan  Fair and Balanced   which was coined by network co founder Roger Ailes while the network was being established  The New York Times described the slogan as being a  blunt signal that Fox News planned to counteract what Mr  Ailes and many others viewed as a liberal bias ingrained in television coverage by establishment news networks                             In a      interview with Peter Robinson of the Hoover Institution  Rupert Murdoch defended the company s  Fair and Balanced  slogan  saying   In fact  you ll find just as many Democrats as Republicans on and so on               
In August       Fox News sued comedian Al Franken over his use of the slogan as a subtitle for his book  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them  A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right  which is critical of Fox News Channel               The lawsuit was dropped three days later  after Judge Denny Chin refused its request for an injunction  In his decision  Chin ruled the case was  wholly without merit  both factually and legally   He went on to suggest that Fox News  trademark on the phrase  fair and balanced  could be invalid               In December       FNC won a legal battle concerning the slogan  when AlterNet filed a cancellation petition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office  USPTO  to have FNC s trademark rescinded as inaccurate  AlterNet included Robert Greenwald s documentary film Outfoxed        as supporting evidence in its case               After losing early motions  AlterNet withdrew its petition  the USPTO dismissed the case               In       FNC used the slogan  We Report  You Decide   referring to  You Decide        FNC s original slogan for its coverage of election issues  
In August       Fox News Channel began to quietly phase out the  Fair and Balanced  slogan in favor of  Most Watched  Most Trusted   when these changes were reported in June      by Gabriel Sherman  a writer who had written a biography on Ailes   a network executive said the change  has nothing to do with programming or editorial decisions   It was speculated by media outlets that Fox News Channel was wishing to distance itself from Ailes  tenure at the network                                         In March       the network introduced a new ad campaign  Real News  Real Honest Opinion  The ad campaign is intended to promote the network s opinion based programming and counter perceptions surrounding  fake news                            
In mid November       following the election  Fox News began to use the slogan  Standing Up For What s Right  to promote its primetime lineup

Benghazi attack and aftermath
Further information       Benghazi attack
Fox News provided extensive coverage of the      Benghazi attack  which host Sean Hannity described in December      as  the story that the mainstream media ignores  and  obviously  a cover up  And we will get to the bottom of it                Programming analysis by media watchdog Media Matters  which has declared a  War on Fox News   found that during the twenty months following the Benghazi attacks  FNC ran       segments on the issue  including              

    segments involving Susan Rice s September           Sunday news show appearances  during which she was falsely accused of lying

    comparisons to Iran Contra  Watergate  and the actions of the Nixon administration
    segments falsely suggesting the administration issued a  stand down order  to prevent a rescue operation in Benghazi
Over nearly four years after the Benghazi attack  there were ten official investigations  including six by Republican controlled House committees  None of the investigations found any evidence of scandal  cover up or lying by Obama administration officials 

Uranium One
Further information  Uranium One controversy
From      into       Fox News broadcast extensive coverage of an alleged scandal surrounding the sale of Uranium One to Russian interests  which host Sean Hannity characterized as  one of the biggest scandals in American history                According to Media Matters  the Fox News coverage extended throughout the programming day  with particular emphasis by Hannity               The network promoted an ultimately unfounded narrative asserting that  as Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton personally approved the Uranium One sale in exchange for           million in bribes paid to the Clinton Foundation  Donald Trump repeated these allegations as a candidate and as president                                         No evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton had been found after four years of allegations  an FBI investigation  and the      appointment of a Federal attorney to evaluate the investigation  In November       Fox News host Shepard Smith concisely debunked the alleged scandal  infuriating viewers who suggested he should work for CNN or MSNBC               Hannity later called Smith  clueless   while Smith stated   I get it  that some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining  I get that  I don t work there  I wouldn t work there                            

Pro Republican and pro Trump bias
Fox News has been described as conservative media                            and as providing biased reporting in favor of conservative political positions                                         the Republican Party                                         and President Donald Trump                                        Political scientist Jonathan Bernstein described Fox News as an expanded part of the Republican Party              Political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A  Hopkins wrote that Fox News helped  Republicans communicate with their base and spread their ideas  and they have been effective in mobilizing voters to participate in midterm elections  as in      and                     Prior to       Fox News lacked an ideological tilt  and had more Democrats watch the channel than Republicans               During the      United States presidential election  Fox News was markedly more hostile in its coverage of Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry  and distinguished itself among cable news outlets for heavy coverage of the Swift Boat smear campaign against Kerry                                         During President Obama s first term in office  Fox News helped launch and amplify the Tea Party movement  a conservative movement within the Republican Party that organized protests against Obama and his policies               In the      documentary Outfoxed  four people identified as former employees said that Fox News made them  slant the news in favor of conservatives                Fox News said that the film misrepresented the employment of these employees              
During the Republican primaries  Fox News was perceived as trying to prevent Trump from clinching the nomination               Under Trump s presidency  Fox News remade itself into his image  as hardly any criticism of Trump could be heard on Fox News  prime time shows                            In Fox News  news reporting  the network dedicated far more coverage to Hillary Clinton related stories  which critics argued was intended to deflect attention from the investigation into Russian interference in the      United States elections               Trump provided significant access to Fox News during his presidency  giving    interviews to the channel while only   in total to other news channels by November       The New York Times described Trump s Fox News interviews as  softball interviews  and some of the interviewers  interview styles as  fawning                In July       The Economist has described the network s coverage of Trump s presidency as  reliably fawning                From      to       the Fox News prime time lineup changed from being skeptical and questioning of Trump to a  Trump safe space  with a dose of Bannonist populism once considered on the fringe                The Fox News website has also become more extreme in its rhetoric since Trump s election  according to Columbia University s Tow Center for Digital Journalism  the Fox News website has  gone a little Breitbart  over time               At the start of       Fox News mostly ignored high profile scandals in the Trump administration which received ample coverage in other national media outlets  such as White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter s resignation amid domestic abuse allegations  the downgrading of Jared Kushner s security clearance  and the existence of a non disclosure agreement between Trump and the porn star Stormy Daniels              
In March       Jane Mayer reported in The New Yorker that Fox News com reporter Diana Falzone had the story of the Stormy Daniels Donald Trump scandal before the      election  but that Fox News executive Ken LaCorte told her   Good reporting  kiddo  But Rupert  Murdoch  wants Donald Trump to win  So just let it go   The story was killed  LaCorte denied making the statement to Falzone  but conceded   I was the person who made the call  I didn t run it upstairs to Roger Ailes or others      I didn t do it to protect Donald Trump   She added that   Falzone  had put up a story that just wasn t anywhere close to being something I was comfortable publishing   Nik Richie  who claimed to be one of the sources for the story  called LaCorte s account  complete bullshit   adding that  Fox News was culpable  I voted for Trump  and I like Fox  but they did their own  catch and kill  on the story to protect him                            
A      study found Fox News gave disproportionate attention to polls suggesting low approval for President Bill Clinton               A      study found Fox News was less likely to pick up stories that reflected well on Democrats  and more likely to pick up stories that reflected well on Republicans               A      study comparing Fox News Channel s Special Report With Brit Hume and NBC s Nightly News coverage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during      concluded  Fox News was much more sympathetic to the administration than NBC   suggesting  if scholars continue to find evidence of a partisan or ideological bias at FNC     they should consider Fox as alternative  rather than mainstream  media               
Research finds that Fox News increases Republican vote shares and makes Republican politicians more partisan                                      A      study  using the introduction of Fox News into local markets             as an instrumental variable  found that in the      presidential election  Republicans gained     to     percentage points in the towns that broadcast Fox News   suggesting  Fox News convinced   to    percent of its viewers to vote Republican  depending on the audience measure                These results were confirmed by a      study              A      study  using the same instrumental variable  found congressional  representatives become less supportive of President Clinton in districts where Fox News begins broadcasting than similar representatives in similar districts where Fox News was not broadcast               Another      paper found Fox News viewing increased Republican vote shares among voters who identified as Republican or independent               A      study  using channel positions as an instrumental variable  found  Fox News increases Republican vote shares by     points among viewers induced into watching     additional minutes per week by variation in position               This study used a different methodology for a later period and found an ever bigger effect and impact  leading Matthew Yglesias to write in the Political Communication academic journal that they  suggest that conventional wisdom may be greatly underestimating the significance of Fox as a factor in American politics               
Fox News publicly denies it is biased               with Murdoch and Ailes saying to have included Murdoch s statement that Fox has  given room to both sides  whereas only one side had it before                             In June                    Fox News host Chris Wallace said   I think we are the counter weight  to NBC News      they have a liberal agenda  and we tell the other side of the story                                          In       Robert Greenwald s documentary film Outfoxed  Rupert Murdoch s War on Journalism argued Fox News had a conservative bias and featured clips from Fox News and internal memos from editorial vice president John Moody directing Fox News staff on how to report certain subjects                           
A leaked memo from Fox News vice president Bill Sammon to news staff at the height of the health care reform in the United States debate has been cited as an example of the pro Republican Party bias of Fox News  His memo asked the staff to  use the term  government run health insurance   or  when brevity is a concern   government option   whenever possible   The memo was sent shortly after Republican pollster Frank Luntz advised Sean Hannity on his Fox show   If you call it a public option  the American people are split  If you call it the government option  the public is overwhelmingly against it               
Surveys suggest Fox News is widely perceived to be ideological  A      Pew survey found Fox News is viewed as the most ideological channel in America  with    percent of those surveyed said Fox News is  mostly conservative      percent said  mostly liberal  and    percent said  neither   In comparison  MSNBC had    percent identify it as  mostly liberal      percent as  mostly conservative  and    percent as  neither   CNN had    percent describe it as  mostly liberal      percent as  mostly conservative  and    percent as  neither                A      Pew Research Center survey found FNC was cited  unprompted  by    percent of national journalists as a conservative news organization               A Rasmussen poll found    percent of Americans felt Fox News had a conservative bias  and    percent that it had a liberal bias  It found    percent believed Fox News delivers news with neither a conservative or liberal bias  compared with    percent who said NPR delivers news with no conservative or liberal bias and    percent who said the same of CNN              
David Carr  media critic for The New York Times  praised the      United States presidential election results coverage on Fox News for the network s response to Republican adviser and Fox News contributor Karl Rove challenging its call that Barack Obama would win Ohio and the election  Fox s prediction was correct  Carr wrote   Over many months  Fox lulled its conservative base with agitprop  that President Obama was a clear failure  that a majority of Americans saw  Mitt  Romney as a good alternative in hard times  and that polls showing otherwise were politically motivated and not to be believed  But on Tuesday night  the people in charge of Fox News were confronted with a stark choice after it became clear that Mr  Romney had fallen short  was Fox  first and foremost  a place for advocacy or a place for news  In this moment  at least  Fox chose news               
A May      study conducted by Harvard University s Shorenstein Center on Media  Politics and Public Policy examined coverage of Trump s first     days in office by several major mainstream media outlets including Fox               It found Trump received     negative coverage from the overall media  and received the least negative coverage on Fox       negative and     positive              
On March           Andrew Napolitano  a Fox News commentator  claimed on Fox  amp  Friends that British intelligence agency GCHQ had wiretapped Trump on behalf of Barack Obama during the      United States presidential election                            On March           White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeated the claim               When Trump was questioned about the claim at a news conference  he said  All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television  I didn t make an opinion on it                On March           Shepard Smith  a Fox News anchor  admitted the network had no evidence that Trump was under surveillance  British officials said the White House was backing off the claim               Napolitano was later suspended by Fox News for making the claim              
In June       Fox News executives instructed producers to head off inappropriate remarks made on the shows aired by the network by hosts and commentators               The instructions came after a number of Fox News hosts and guests made incendiary comments about the Trump administration s policy of separating migrant children from their parents               Fox News host Laura Ingraham had likened the child detention centers that the children were in to  summer camps   Guest Corey Lewandowski mocked the story of a    year old child with Down syndrome being separated from her mother  the Fox News host did not address Lewandowski s statement               Guest Ann Coulter falsely claimed that the separated children were  child actors   the Fox News host did not challenge her claim               In a segment on Trump s alleged use of racial dog whistles  one Fox News contributor told an African American whom he was debating   You re out of your cotton picking mind               
According to the      book Asymmetric Politics by political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A  Hopkins   Fox News tends to raise the profile of scandals and controversies involving Democrats that receive scant attention in other media  such as the relationship between Barack Obama and William Ayers     Hillary Clinton s role in the fatal      attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi  Libya  the gun running scandal known as  Fast and Furious   the business practices of federal loan guarantee recipient Solyndra  the past activism of Obama White House operative Van Jones  the      attacks on John Kerry by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth  the controversial sermons of Obama s Chicago pastor Jeremiah Wright  the filming of undercover videos of supposed wrongdoing by the liberal activist group ACORN  and the  war on Christmas  supposedly waged every December by secular  multicultural liberals               
In October       Fox News ran laudatory coverage of a meeting between Trump supporting rapper Kanye West and President Trump in the Oval Office  Fox News had previously run negative coverage of rappers and their involvement with Democratic politicians and causes  such as when Fox News ran headlines describing conscious hip hop artist Common as  vile  and a  cop killer rapper   and when Fox News ran negative coverage of Kanye West before he became a Trump supporter              
On November          Trump s website  DonaldJTrump com  announced in a press release that Fox News host Sean Hannity would make a  special guest appearance  with Trump at a midterm campaign rally the following night in Cape Girardeau  Missouri               The following morning  Hannity tweeted  To be clear  I will not be on stage campaigning with the President                Hannity appeared at the president s lectern on stage at the rally  immediately mocking the  fake news  at the back of the auditorium  Fox News reporters among them  Several Fox News employees expressed outrage at Hannity s actions  with one stating that  a new line was crossed                Hannity later asserted that his action was not pre planned  and Fox News stated it  does not condone any talent participating in campaign events                Fox News host Jeanine Pirro also appeared on stage with Trump at the rally  The Trump press release was later removed from Trump s website                           
Fox News released a poll of registered voters  jointly conducted by two polling organizations  on June           The poll found some unfavorable results for Trump  including a record high     thought the Trump campaign had coordinated with the Russian government  and     thought he should be impeached       saying he should also be removed from office   while     said they did not favor impeachment                            The next morning on Fox  amp  Friends First  host Heather Childers twice misrepresented the poll results  stating  a new Fox News poll shows most voters don t want impeachment  and  at least half of U S  voters do not think President Trump should be impeached   while the on screen display of the actual poll question was also incorrect  Later that morning on America s Newsroom  the on screen display showed the correct poll question and results  but highlighted the     of respondents who opposed impeachment rather than the     who supported it  the latter being broken out into two figures   As host Bill Hemmer drew guest Byron York s attention to the     opposed figure  they did not discuss the     support figure  while the on screen chyron read   Fox News Poll      Support Trump s Impeachment and Removal      Oppose                Later that day  Trump tweeted    FoxNews Polls are always bad for me   Something weird going on at Fox               
In April       it became known that former Obama administration national security advisor Susan Rice sought the unmasking of Trump associates who were unidentified in intelligence reports  notably Trump s incoming national security advisor Michael Flynn  during the presidential transition               In May       acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell  a Trump loyalist  declassified a list of Obama administration officials who had also requested unmasking of Trump associates  which was subsequently publicly released by Republican senators               That month  attorney general Bill Barr appointed federal prosecutor John Bash to examine the unmaskings               Fox News primetime hosts declared the unmaskings a  domestic spying operation  for which the Obama administration was  exposed  in the  biggest abuse of power  in American history               The Bash inquiry closed months later with no findings of substantive wrongdoing              
However  certain Fox personalities have not had as much of a favorable reception from Trump  news anchors Shepard Smith  who retired from Fox in       and Chris Wallace have been criticized by Trump for allegedly being adversarial                            alongside Fox analyst Andrew Napolitano  who said Trump s actions in the Trump Ukraine scandal were  both criminal and impeachable behavior                Trump was also critical of the network hiring former DNC chair Donna Brazile  in                    The relationship between Trump and Fox News  as well as other Rupert Murdoch controlled outlets  soured following the      United States presidential election  as Trump refused to concede that Joe Biden had been elected President elect                            This negative tonal shift led to increased viewership of Newsmax and One America News among Trump and his supporters due to their increased antipathy towards Fox                                                      and as a result  Fox released promotional videos of their opinion hosts disputing the election results  promoting a Trump affiliated conspiracy theory about voter fraud               By one measure  Newsmax saw a      spike in viewership  while Fox News saw a     decline              
Writing for the Poynter Institute for Media Studies in February       senior media writer Tom Jones argued that the primary distinction between Fox News and MSNBC is not right bias vs  left bias  but rather that much of the content on Fox News  especially during its primetime programs   is not based in truth               
The Tampa Bay Times reported in August      that it had reviewed four months of emails indicating Fox News producers had coordinated with aides of Florida governor Ron DeSantis to promote his political prospects by inviting him for frequent network appearances  exchanging talking points and  in one case  helping him to stage an exclusive news event              
In February       Alan Rosenblatt of Johns Hopkins University said that Fox News  is an entertainment company that has a news division  not a news company   adding that it  not only does not provide that distinction  it goes out of its way to make it difficult to see the difference  They make their opinion programs look like news programs  and they incorporate enough opinion content on their news programs to further that deception              
In early       Fox News host Jesse Watters promoted a conspiracy theory involving Taylor Swift  Travis Kelce  and the American Democratic party in hopes of influencing voters ahead of the U S  presidential primary season                         
Fox News has published headlines accusing the English Wikipedia of having a left wing and socialist bias              

Coverage of Russia investigation
Further information  Mueller special counsel investigation
On October           when special counsel Robert Mueller indicted Paul Manafort and Rick Gates  and revealed George Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty  all of whom were involved in the Trump      campaign   this was the focus of most media s coverage  except Fox News                Hosts and guests on Fox News called for Mueller to be fired                            Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson focused their shows on unsubstantiated allegations that Clinton sold uranium to Russia in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation and on the Clinton campaign s role in funding the Steele dossier                            Hannity asserted   The very thing they are accusing President Trump of doing  they did it themselves                During the segment  Hannity mistakenly referred to Clinton as President Clinton                            Fox News dedicated extensive coverage to the uranium story  which Democrats said was an attempt to distract from Mueller s intensifying investigation                            CNN described the coverage as  a tour de force in deflection and dismissal                On October     CNN reported Fox News employees were dissatisfied with their outlet s coverage of the Russia investigation  with employees calling it an  embarrassment    laughable   and saying it  does the viewer a huge disservice and further divides the country  and that it is  another blow to journalists at Fox who come in every day wanting to cover the news in a fair and objective way                            
When the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the      presidential election intensified in October       the focus of Fox News coverage turned  what they see as the scandal and wrongdoing of President Trump s political opponents  In reports like these  Bill and Hillary Clinton are prominent and recurring characters because they are considered the real conspirators working with the Russians to undermine American democracy                Paul Waldman of The Washington Post described the coverage as  No puppet  You re the puppet   saying it was a  careful  coordinated  and comprehensive strategy  to distract from Mueller s investigation               German Lopes of Vox said Fox News  coverage has reached  levels of self parody  as it dedicated coverage to low key stories  such as a controversial Newsweek op ed and hamburger emojis  while other networks had wall to wall coverage of Mueller s indictments              
A FiveThirtyEight analysis of Russia related media coverage in cable news found most mentions of Russia on Fox News were spoken in close proximity to  uranium  and  dossier                On November          Vox analyzed the transcripts of Fox News  CNN and MSNBC  and found Fox News  was unable to talk about the Mueller investigation without bringing up Hillary Clinton    talked significantly less about George Papadopoulos the Trump campaign adviser whose plea deal with Mueller provides the most explicit evidence thus far that the campaign knew of the Russian government s efforts to help Trump than its competitors   and  repeatedly called Mueller s credibility into question               
In December       Fox News escalated its attacks on the Mueller investigation  with hosts and guest commentators suggesting the investigation amounted to a coup                                                                   Guest co host Kevin Jackson referred to a right wing conspiracy theory claiming Strzok s messages are evidence of a plot by FBI agents to assassinate Trump  a claim which the other Fox co hosts quickly said is not supported by any credible evidence                            Fox News host Jeanine Pirro called the Mueller investigation team a  criminal cabal  and said the team ought to be arrested               Other Fox News figures referred to the investigation as  corrupt    crooked   and  illegitimate   and likened the FBI to the KGB  the Soviet era spy organization that routinely tortured and summarily executed people               Political scientists and scholars of coups described the Fox News rhetoric as scary and dangerous               Experts on coups rejected that the Mueller investigation amounted to a coup  rather  the Fox News rhetoric was dangerous to democracy and mirrored the kind of rhetoric that occurs before purges               A number of observers argued the Fox News rhetoric was intended to discredit the Mueller investigation and sway President Donald Trump to fire Mueller              
In August       Fox News was criticized for giving more prominent coverage of a murder committed by an undocumented immigrant than the convictions of Donald Trump s former campaign manager  Paul Manafort  and his long term personal attorney  Michael Cohen               At the same time  most other national mainstream media gave wall to wall coverage of the convictions               Fox News hosts Dana Perrino and Jason Chaffetz argued that voters care far more about the murder than the convictions of the President s former top aides  and hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity downplayed the convictions                                        

False claims about other media
CNN s Jake Tapper
In November       following the      New York City truck attack wherein a terrorist shouted  Allahu Akbar   Fox News distorted a statement by Jake Tapper to make it appear as if he had said  Allahu Akbar  can be used under the most  beautiful circumstances   Fox News omitted that Tapper had said the use of  Allahu Akbar  in the terrorist attack was not one of these beautiful circumstances  A headline on FoxNews com was preceded by a tag reading  OUTRAGEOUS   The Fox News Twitter account distorted the statement even more  saying  Jake Tapper Says  Allahu Akbar  Is  Beautiful  Right After NYC Terror Attack  in a tweet that was later deleted  Tapper chastised Fox News for choosing to  deliberately lie  and said  there was a time when one could tell the difference between Fox and the nutjobs at Infowars  It s getting tougher and tougher  Lies are lies                In       Tapper had come to the defense of Fox News while he was a White House correspondent for ABC News  after the Obama administration claimed that the network was not a legitimate news organization              
Fox News guest host Jason Chaffetz apologized to Tapper for misrepresenting his statement               After Fox News had deleted the tweet  Sean Hannity repeated the misrepresentation and called Tapper  liberal fake news CNN s fake Jake Tapper  and mocked his ratings                           

The New York Times
In July       a report by Fox  amp  Friends falsely said The New York Times had disclosed intelligence in one of its stories and that this intelligence disclosure helped Abu Bakr al Baghdadi  the leader of the Islamic State  to evade capture                                         The report cited an inaccurate assertion by Gen  Tony Thomas  the head of the United States Special Operations Command  that a major newspaper had disclosed the intelligence                            Fox News said it was The New York Times  repeatedly running the chyron  NYT Foils U S  Attempt To Take Out Al Bahgdadi                Pete Hegseth  one of the show s hosts  criticized the  failing New York Times                President Donald Trump tweeted about the Fox  amp  Friends report shortly after it first aired  saying  The Failing New York Times foiled U S  attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist  Al Baghdadi  Their sick agenda over National Security                Fox News later updated the story  but without apologizing to The New York Times or responding directly to the inaccuracies              
In a Washington Post column  Erik Wemple said Chris Wallace had covered The New York Times story himself on Fox News Sunday  adding   Here s another case of the differing standards between Fox News s opinion operation   which has given  a state run vibe on all matters related to Trump   compared to Fox News s news operation  which has provided  mostly sane coverage               

Climate change
Further information  Climate change denial and Media coverage of climate change
Fox News has often been described as a major platform for climate change denial                                                      According to the fact checking website Climate Feedback  Fox News is part of  a network of unreliable outlets for climate news                A      study by Lauren Feldman and Anthony Leiserowitz found Fox News  takes a more dismissive tone toward climate change than CNN and MSNBC                A      study found Fox News emphasized the scientific uncertainty of climate change more than CNN  was less likely to say climate change was real  and more likely to interview climate change skeptics               Leaked emails showed that in      Bill Sammon  the Fox News Washington managing editor  instructed Fox News journalists to dispute the scientific consensus on climate change and  refrain from asserting that the planet has warmed  or cooled  in any given period without IMMEDIATELY pointing out that such theories are based upon data that critics have called into question               
According to climate scientist Michael E  Mann  Fox News  has constructed an alternative universe where the laws of physics no longer apply  where the greenhouse effect is a myth  and where climate change is a hoax  the product of a massive conspiracy among scientists  who somehow have gotten the polar bears  glaciers  sea levels  superstorms  and megadroughts to play along                According to James Lawrence Powell s      study of the climate science denial movement  Fox News provides  the deniers with a platform to say whatever they like without fear of contradiction                Fox News employs Steve Milloy  a prominent climate change denier with close financial and organizational ties to oil companies  as a contributor  In his columns about climate change for FoxNews com  Fox News has failed to disclose his substantial funding from oil companies              
In       the hosts of Fox  amp  Friends described climate change as  unproven science   a  disputed fact   and criticized the Department of Education for working together with the children s network Nickelodeon to teach children about climate change               In       Sean Hannity described the scientific consensus on climate change as  phony science from the left                In       he falsely alleged that  scientists still can t agree on whether the global warming is scientific fact or fiction                In       Hannity said the so called  Climategate    the leaking of e mails by climate scientist that climate change skeptics claimed demonstrated scientific misconduct but which all subsequent enquiries have found no evidence of misconduct or wrongdoing   a  scandal  that  exposed global warming as a myth cooked up by alarmists                Hannity frequently invites contrarian fringe scientists and critics of climate change to his shows               In       a widely shared Fox News news report falsely claimed that new climate science research showed that the Earth might be heading to a new Ice Age  the author of the study that Fox News cited said that Fox News  utterly misrepresents our research  and the study did not in any way suggest that Earth was heading to an Ice Age  Fox News later corrected the story              
Shepard Smith drew attention for being one of few voices formerly on Fox News to forcefully state that climate change is real  that human activities are a primary contributor to it and that there is a scientific consensus on the issue                            His acceptance of the scientific consensus on climate change drew criticism from Fox News viewers and conservatives                            Smith left Fox News in October                    In a      interview with Christiane Amanpour on her eponymous show in CNN  he stated that his presence on Fox had become  untenable  due to the  falsehoods  and  lies  intentionally spread on the network s opinion shows                           

Murder of Seth Rich conspiracy
See also  Murder of Seth Rich
On May           a day when other news organizations were extensively covering Donald Trump s revelation of classified information to Russia               Fox News ran a lead story about a private investigator s uncorroborated claims about the murder of Seth Rich  a DNC staffer                                         The private investigator said he had uncovered evidence that Rich was in contact with WikiLeaks and law enforcement were covering it up               The killing of Rich has given rise to conspiracy theories in right wing circles that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party had Seth Rich killed allegedly because he was the source of the DNC leaks               U S  intelligence agencies determined Russia was the source of the leaks               In reporting the investigator s claims  the Fox News report reignited right wing conspiracy theories about the killing                           
The Fox News story fell apart within hours               Other news organizations quickly revealed the investigator was a Donald Trump supporter and had according to NBC News  developed a reputation for making outlandish claims  such as      one appearance      on Fox News in      in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistol toting lesbian gangs were raping young women                             The family of Seth Rich  the Washington D C  police department  the Washington D C  mayor s office  the FBI  and law enforcement sources familiar with the case rebuked the investigator s claims                            Rich s relatives said   We are a family who is committed to facts  not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth s murderers                The spokesperson for the family criticized Fox News for its reporting  alleging the outlet was motivated by a desire to deflect attention from the Trump Russia story   I think there s a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda                The family has called for retractions and apologies from Fox News for the inaccurate reporting                            Over the course of the day  Fox News altered the contents of the story and the headline  but did not issue corrections                            When CNN contacted the private investigator later that day  the investigator said he had no evidence that Rich had contacted WikiLeaks               The investigator claimed he only learned about the possible existence of the evidence from a Fox News reporter               Fox News did not respond to inquiries by CNN  and the Washington Post                            Fox News later on May     seven days after the story was published  retracted its original report  saying the original report did not meet its standards                           
Nicole Hemmer  then assistant professor at the      Miller Center of Public Affairs  wrote that the promotion of the conspiracy theory demonstrated how Fox News was  remaking itself in the image of fringe media in the age of Trump  blurring the lines between real and fake news                Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations said while intent behind Fox News  as a counterweight to the liberal media was laudable  the culmination of those efforts have been to create an alternative news source that promotes hoaxes and myths  of which the promotion of the Seth Rich conspiracy is an example               Fox News was also criticized by conservative outlets  such as The Weekly Standard               National Review                            and conservative columnists  such as Jennifer Rubin               Michael Gerson               and John Podhoretz              
Rich s parents  Joel and Mary Rich  sued Fox News for the emotional distress it had caused them by its false reporting  In       Fox News settled with Rich family  making a payment that was not officially disclosed but which was reported to be in the seven figures               Although the settlement had been agreed to earlier in the year  Fox News arranged to delay the public announcement until after the      presidential election                           

Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville
Further information  Unite the Right rally
Fox News hosts and contributors defended Trump s remarks that  many sides  were to blame for violence at a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville  Virginia                            Some criticized Trump                            In a press conference on August     Trump used the term  alt left  to describe counterprotesters at the white supremacist rally  a term which had been used in Fox News  coverage of the white supremacist rally               Several of Trump s comments at the press conference mirrored those appearing earlier on Fox News              
According to Dylan Byers of CNN  Fox News  coverage on the day of the press conference  was heavy with  whataboutism   The average Fox viewer was likely left with the impression that the media s criticism of Trump and leftist protestors  toppling of some Confederate statues were far greater threats to America than white supremacism or the president s apparent defense of bigotry                Byers wrote  it showed that if Fox News has a line when it comes to Trump s presidency  it was not crossed on Tuesday               

Glenn Beck s comments about George Soros
During Glenn Beck s tenure at Fox News  he became one of the most high profile proponents of conspiracy theories about George Soros  a Jewish Hungarian American businessman and philanthropist known for his donations to American liberal political causes               Beck regularly described Soros as a  puppet master  and used common anti Semitic tropes to describe Soros and his activities               In a      three part series  Beck depicted George Soros as a cartoonish villain trying to  form a shadow government  using humanitarian aid as a cover   and that Soros wanted a one world government                            Beck promoted the false and anti Semitic conspiracy theory that Soros was a Nazi collaborator as a    year old in Nazi occupied Hungary               Beck also characterized Soros s mother as a  wildly anti Semitic  Nazi collaborator               According to The Washington Post   Beck s series was largely considered obscene and delusional  if not outright anti Semitic   but Beck s conspiracy theory became common on the right wing of American politics               Amid criticism of Beck s false smears  Fox News defended Beck  stating  information regarding Mr  Soros s experiences growing up were taken directly from his writings and from interviews given by him to the media  and no negative opinion was offered as to his actions as a child                             Roger Ailes  then head of Fox News  dismissed criticism levied at Beck by hundreds of rabbis  saying that they were  left wing rabbis who basically don t think that anybody can ever use the word  Holocaust  on the air               

COVID    pandemic
Main articles  Fox News coverage of the COVID    pandemic and Media coverage of the COVID    pandemic
During the first few weeks of the COVID    pandemic in the United States  Fox News was considerably more likely than other mainstream news outlets to promote misinformation about COVID                  The network promoted the narrative that the emergency response to the pandemic was politically motivated or otherwise unwarranted               with Sean Hannity explicitly calling it a  hoax   he later denied doing so  and other hosts downplaying it               This coverage was consistent with the messaging of Trump at the time               Only in mid March did the network change the tone of its coverage               after President Trump declared a national emergency               At the same time that Fox News commentators downplayed the threat of the virus in public  Fox s management and the Murdoch family took a broad range of internal measures to protect themselves and their employees against it                                                     
Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham  two of Fox News s primetime hosts  promoted use of the drug hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID     an off label usage which at the time was supported only by anecdotal evidence  after it was touted by Trump as a possible cure               Fox News promoted a conspiracy theory that coronavirus death toll numbers were inflated with people who would have died anyway from preexisting conditions  This was disputed by White House coronavirus task force members Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx  with Fauci describing conspiracy theories as  nothing but distractions  during public health crises               Later in the pandemic  Hannity  Ingraham and Carlson promoted the use of livestock dewormer ivermectin as a possible COVID    treatment              
Studies have linked trust in Fox News               as well as viewership of Fox News               with fewer preventive behaviors and more risky behaviors related to COVID                 
Once a COVID    vaccine became widely available  Fox News consistently questioned the efficacy and safety of the vaccine  celebrated evidence free skepticism  and blasted attempts to promote vaccinations               More than     of Fox Corporation s full time employees had been fully vaccinated by September

After Trump s defeat in the      presidential election  Fox News host Jeanine Pirro promoted baseless allegations on her program that voting machine company Smartmatic and its competitor Dominion Voting Systems had conspired to rig the election against Trump  Hosts Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo also promoted the allegations on their programs on sister network Fox Business               In December       Smartmatic sent a letter to Fox News demanding retractions and threatening legal action  specifying that retractions  must be published on multiple occasions  so as to  match the attention and audience targeted with the original defamatory publications                Days later  each of the three programs aired the same three minute video segment consisting of an interview with an election technology expert who refuted the allegations promoted by the hosts  responding to questions from an unseen and unidentified man  None of the three hosts personally issued retractions  Smartmatic filed a      billion defamation suit against the network  the three hosts  Powell and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in February                    In an April      court brief seeking dismissal of the suit  Fox attorney Paul Clement argued that the network was simply  reporting allegations made by a sitting President and his lawyers                A New York State Supreme Court judge ruled in March      that the suit could proceed  though he dismissed allegations against Sidney Powell and Pirro  and some claims against Giuliani  The judge allowed allegations against Bartiromo and Dobbs to stand               The New York Supreme Court  Appellate Division unanimously rejected a Fox News bid to dismiss the Smartmatic suit in February       The court reinstated defamation allegations against Giuliani and Pirro                           
In December       Dominion Voting Systems sent a similar letter demanding retractions to Trump attorney Sidney Powell                                         who had promoted the allegations on Fox programs                                         On March           Dominion filed a           billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News  alleging that Fox and some of its pundits spread conspiracy theories about Dominion  and allowed guests to make false statements about the company               On May           Fox News filed a motion to dismiss the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit  asserting a First Amendment right  to inform the public about newsworthy allegations of paramount public concern                The motion to dismiss was denied on December           by a Delaware Superior Court judge               In addition to Bartiromo  Dobbs  and Pirro  the suit also names primetime hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity               Venezuelan businessman Majed Khalil sued Fox  Dobbs and Powell for      million in December       alleging they had falsely implicated him in rigging Dominion and Smartmatic machines               Dobbs and Fox News reached a confidential settlement with Khalil in April                   
Fox News was the only major network or cable news outlet to not carry the first televised prime time hearing of the January   committee live  its regular programming of Tucker Carlson Tonight and Hannity was aired without commercial breaks  During the weeks following the election  Carlson and Hannity often amplified Trump s election falsehoods on their programs  previously disclosed text messages between Hannity and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany were presented during the hearing  Hannity told his audience   Unlike this committee and their cheerleaders in the media mob  we will actually be telling you the truth   while Carlson said   This is the only hour on an American news channel that won t be covering their propaganda live  They are lying and we are not going to help them do it                                                      
In June       a Delaware Superior Court judge again declined to dismiss the Dominion suit against Fox News  and also allowed Dominion to sue the network s corporate parent  Fox Corporation  The judge ruled that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch may have acted with actual malice because there was a reasonable inference they  either knew Dominion had not manipulated the election or at least recklessly disregarded the truth when they allegedly caused Fox News to propagate its claims about Dominion   He noted a report that Rupert Murdoch spoke with Trump a few days after the election and informed him that he had lost              
The New York Times reported in December      that Dominion had acquired communications between Fox News executives and hosts  and between a Fox Corporation employee and the Trump White House  showing they knew that what the network was reporting was untrue  Dominion attorneys said hosts Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson  and Fox executives  attested to this in sworn depositions  In November       Hannity hosted Sidney Powell  who asserted Dominion machines had been rigged  but said in his deposition   I did not believe it for one second                A February      Dominion court filing showed Fox News primetime hosts messaging each other to insult and mock Trump advisers  indicating the hosts knew the allegations made by Powell and Giuliani were false  Rupert Murdoch messaged that Trump s voter fraud claims were  really crazy stuff   telling Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott that it was  terrible stuff damaging everybody  I fear   As a January      Georgia runoff election approached that would determine party control of the U S  Senate  Murdoch told Scott   Trump will concede eventually and we should concentrate on Georgia  helping any way we can                                                      
After the      election  the network developed a cutting edge system to call elections  which proved very successful during the      midterm elections  The network was the first to call the      Arizona race for Biden  angering many viewers  Washington managing editor Bill Sammon supervised the network s Decision Desk that made the call  Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum  the network s main news anchors  suggested during a high level conference call that relying solely on data to make the call was inadequate and that viewer reaction should also be considered  MacCallum said   in a Trump environment  the game is just very  very different   Sammon stood by the      call and was fired by the network after the January      Georgia runoff              
In       Rupert Murdoch was deposed and testified that some Fox News commentators were endorsing election fraud claims they knew were false                           
In February       Fox s internal communications were released  showing that its presenters and senior executives privately doubted Donald Trump s claims of a stolen election              Chairman Rupert Murdoch once described Trump s voter fraud claims as  really crazy stuff   and also said that Trump advisers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell s television appearances were  terrible stuff damaging everybody               One November      exchange showed Tucker Carlson accusing Powell of  lying     I caught her  It s insane   with Laura Ingraham responding that  Sidney is a complete nut  No one will work with her  Ditto with Rudy               In another exchange that month  Carlson called for Fox journalist Jacqui Heinrich to be  fired  because she fact checked Trump and said that there was no evidence of voter fraud from Dominion              Carlson said that Heinrich s actions  needs to stop immediately  like tonight  It s measurably hurting the company  The stock price is down   while Heinrich deleted the fact check the next morning             
In March       more of Fox s internal communications were released              One November      communication showed Fox CEO Suzanne Scott criticizing fact checking  stating that she cannot  keep defending these reporters who don t understand our viewers and how to handle stories     The audience feels like we crapped on  them  and Fox was losing their audience s  trust and belief  in them              Another December      communication showed Scott responding to Fox presenter Eric Shawn s fact checking of Donald Trump s false      election claims by demanding that the fact checking  has to stop now     This is bad business     The audience is furious              
On March           Delaware Superior Court judge Eric Davis ruled in a summary judgment that it  is CRYSTAL clear that none of the statements relating to Dominion about the      election are true  and ordered for the case to go to trial             
On April           Fox News reached a settlement with Dominion just before the trial started  concluding the lawsuit  Fox agreed to pay Dominion        million  and further stated   We acknowledge the Court s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false              

Compulsory reductions in meat consumption
In April                    at least five Fox News and Fox Business personalities amplified a story published by the Daily Mail  a British tabloid  that incorrectly linked a university study to President Joe Biden s climate change agenda  to falsely assert that Americans would be compelled to dramatically reduce their meat consumption to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions caused by flatulence  Fox News aired a graphic detailing the supposed compulsory reductions  falsely indicating the information came from the Agriculture Department  which numerous Republican politicians and commentators tweeted  Fox News anchor John Roberts reported to  say goodbye to your burgers if you want to sign up to the Biden climate agenda   Days later  Roberts acknowledged on air that the story was false                                        

Report that Biden administration was continuing to build the Mexico United States border wall
According to analysis by Media Matters  on May           Fox News reported on its website   Biden resumes border wall construction after promising to halt it   Correspondent Bill Melugin then appeared on Special Report with Bret Baier to report  the U S  Army Corps of Engineers is actually going to be restarting border wall construction down in the Rio Grande Valley  after  a lot of blowback and pressure from local residents and local politicians   After the Corps of Engineers tweeted a clarification  Melugin deleted a tweet about the story and tweeted an  update  clarifying that a levee wall was being constructed to mitigate damage to flood control systems caused by uncompleted wall construction  and the website story headline was changed to  Biden administration to resume border wall levee construction as crisis worsens   Later on Fox News Primetime  host Brian Kilmeade briefly noted the levee but commented to former Trump advisor Stephen Miller   They re going to restart building the wall again  Stephen   Fox News host Sean Hannity later broadcast the original Melugin story without any mention of the levee                                        


Crime reporting
Media Matters reported in September      that during the Biden presidency Fox News had promoted a false  crime crisis  narrative  particularly directed toward undocumented migrants  which reflected Donald Trump s political rhetoric  The Fox News narrative consisted of reported violent crime anecdotes rather than FBI crime rate statistics showing violent crime had declined significantly since       One Fox host  Ainsley Earhardt  said that even if the FBI data were right   we re all a little bit more scared than we used to be   Later that month  weeks before the      presidential election  the FBI released crime data for      showing that violent crime had declined    from       The report was widely covered by mainstream news outlets that day  though the Fox News coverage was limited to a    second segment by evening anchor Bret Baier  He reported  critics say the report is not accurate because it does not include big cities   echoing a false assertion made by Elon Musk and other Trump supporters on social media                           

Controversies
Main article  Fox News controversies
Sexual harassment
The network has been accused of permitting sexual harassment and racial discrimination by on air hosts  executives  and employees                                         paying out millions of dollars in legal settlements                            Prominent Fox News figures such as Roger Ailes  Bill O Reilly and Eric Bolling were fired after many women accused them of sexual harassment  At least four lawsuits alleged Fox News co president Bill Shine ignored  enabled or concealed Roger Ailes  alleged sexual harassment                                         Fox News CEO Rupert Murdoch has dismissed the high profile sexual misconduct allegations as  largely political  and speculated they were made  because we are conservative               
Bill O Reilly and Fox News settled six agreements  totaling          million  with women who accused O Reilly of sexual harassment                            In January       shortly after Bill O Reilly settled a sexual harassment lawsuit for          million   an extraordinarily large amount for such cases    Fox News renewed Bill O Reilly s contract               Fox News s parent company    st Century Fox  said it was aware of the lawsuit               The contract between O Reilly and Fox News read he could not be fired from the network unless sexual harassment allegations were proven in court              
Fox News s extensive coverage of the Harvey Weinstein scandal in October      was seen by some as hypocritical                            Fox News dedicated at least    hours of coverage to the Weinstein scandal  yet only dedicated    minutes to Bill O Reilly  who just like Weinstein had been accused of sexual harassment by a multitude of women                            A few weeks later  when a number of females under the age of     including a    year old  accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of making sexual advances  Hannity dismissed the sexual misconduct allegations and dedicated coverage on his TV show to casting doubt on the accusers                            Other prime time Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham queried The Washington Post     s reporting or opted to bring up sexual misconduct allegations regarding show business figures such as Harvey Weinstein and Louis C K               Fox News figures Jeanine Pirro and Gregg Jarrett questioned both the validity of The Washington Post     s reporting and that of the women               In December       a few days before the Alabama Senate election  Fox News  along with the conspiracy websites Breitbart News and The Gateway Pundit  ran an inaccurate headline which claimed one of Roy Moore s accusers admitted to forging an inscription by Roy Moore in her yearbook  Fox News later added a correction to the story              
A number of Fox News hosts have welcomed Bill O Reilly to their shows and paid tributes to Roger Ailes after his death  In May       Hannity called Ailes  a second father  and said to Ailes s  enemies  that he was  preparing to kick your a   in the next life                Ailes had the year before been fired from Fox News after women alleged he sexually harassed them               In September       several months after Bill O Reilly was fired from Fox News in the wake of women alleging he sexually harassed them  Hannity hosted O Reilly on his show                                         Some Fox News employees criticized the decision               According to CNN  during the interview  Hannity found kinship with O Reilly as he appeared  to feel that he and O Reilly have both become victims of liberals looking to silence them               

Obama administration conflict
In September       the Obama administration engaged in a verbal conflict with Fox News Channel  On September     President Barack Obama appeared on all major news programs except Fox News  a snub partially in response to remarks about him by commentators Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity and Fox coverage of Obama s health care proposal                           
In late September       Obama s senior advisor David Axelrod and Roger Ailes met in secret to attempt to smooth out tensions between the two camps  Two weeks later  White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel referred to FNC as  not a news network  and communications director Anita Dunn said  Fox News often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party                             Obama commented   If media is operating basically as a talk radio format  then that s one thing  and if it s operating as a news outlet  then that s another                Emanuel said it was important  to not have the CNNs and the others in the world basically be led in following Fox               
Within days  it was reported that Fox had been excluded from an interview with administration official Ken Feinberg  with bureau chiefs from the White House press pool  ABC  CBS  NBC  and CNN  coming to Fox s defense               A bureau chief said   If any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing  it has nothing to do with Fox or the White House or the substance of the issues                Shortly after the story broke  the White House admitted to a low level mistake  saying Fox had not made a specific request to interview Feinberg  Fox White House correspondent Major Garrett said he had not made a specific request  but had a  standing request from me as senior White House correspondent on Fox to interview any newsmaker at the Treasury at any given time news is being made               
On November          the Los Angeles Times reported an unnamed Democratic consultant was warned by the White House not to appear on Fox News again  According to the article  Dunn claimed in an e mail to have checked with colleagues who  deal with TV issues  who denied telling anyone to avoid Fox  Patrick Caddell  a Fox News contributor and former pollster for President Jimmy Carter  said he had spoken with other Democratic consultants who had received similar warnings from the White House              
On October          Fox News host Anna Kooiman cited on the air a fake story from the National Report parody site  which claimed Obama had offered to keep the International Museum of Muslim Cultures open with cash from his own pocket                           

Journalistic ethical standards
Fox News attracted controversy in April      when it was revealed primetime host Sean Hannity had defended Trump s then personal attorney Michael Cohen on air without disclosing Cohen was his lawyer               On April          federal agents from the U S  Attorney s office served a search warrant on Cohen s office and residence               On the air  Hannity defended Cohen and criticized the federal action  calling it  highly questionable  and  an unprecedented abuse of power                On April           in a court hearing  Cohen s lawyers told the judge that Cohen had ten clients in           but did  traditional legal tasks  for only three  Trump  Elliott Broidy  and a  prominent person  who did not wish to be named for fear of being  embarrassed                                          The federal judge ordered the revelation of the third client  whom Cohen s lawyers named as Hannity              
Hannity was not sanctioned by Fox News for this breach of journalistic ethics  with Fox News releasing a statement that the channel was unaware of Hannity s relationship to Cohen and that it had  spoken to Sean and he continues to have our full support                                                       Media ethics experts said that Hannity s disclosure failure was a major breach of journalistic ethics and that the network should have suspended or fired him for it              

NYC Human Rights Law violations
In mid       Fox News agreed to pay a    million settlement to New York City after its Commission on Human Rights cited  a pattern of violating the NYC Human Rights Law   A Fox News spokesperson claimed that  FOX News Media has already been in full compliance across the board  but  settled  to continue enacting extensive preventive measures against all forms of discrimination and harassment               

Climate denial and misinformation
During the May           episode of Fox News Tonight  discussing Roman climate protesters drawing attention on drought and floods in Italy  the correspondent Trace Gallagher downplayed the role of climate change for the recent meteorological situation pointing at Italian history

FNC was carried in the United Kingdom by Sky  which was    percent owned by   st Century Fox at the time  and operates its own domestic news channel Sky News  On August           Sky dropped Fox News  the broadcaster said its carriage was not  commercially viable  due to average viewership of fewer than       viewers per day  The company said the decision was unrelated to   st Century Fox s proposed acquisition of the remainder of Sky plc  which ultimately led to a bidding war that resulted in its acquisition by Comcast instead               
The potential co ownership had prompted concerns from critics of the deal  who felt Sky News could similarly undergo a shift to an opinionated format with a right wing viewpoint  However  such a move would violate Ofcom broadcast codes  which requires all news programming to show due impartiality  The channel s broadcasts in the country have violated this rule on several occasions  while the channel also violated election silence rules by broadcasting analysis of the      Brexit referendum while polls were still open  the channel was blacked out while polls were open during the      general election to comply with the rule
