Lee s Broken Ladder Game edit 
This game was played between Lee Sedol and Hong Chang sik during the      KAT cup  on    April       The game is notable for Lee s use of a broken ladder formation 
Normally playing out a broken ladder is a mistake  associated with beginner play  because the chasing stones are left weak  Between experts it should be decisive  leading to a lost game  Lee  playing black  defied the conventional wisdom  using the broken ladder to capture a large group of Hong s stones in the lower right side of the board  This brought black s stones in the corner which were previously considered dead back to life  White ultimately resigned

Match against AlphaGo edit 
Main article  AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol
Starting   March       Lee played a five game match  broadcast live  against the computer program AlphaGo  developed by a London based artificial intelligence firm Google DeepMind  for a    million match prize                                      He said  I have heard that Google DeepMind s AI is surprisingly strong and getting stronger  but I am confident that I can win at least this time               In an interview with Sohn Suk hee of JTBC Newsroom on    February                   he showed confidence in his chances again  while saying that even beating AlphaGo by     may allow the Google DeepMind team to claim its de facto victory and the defeat of him  or even humanity  In this interview he pointed out the time rule in this match  which seems well balanced so that both he and the AI would fairly undergo time pressure  In another interview at Yonhap News  Lee Se dol said that he was confident of beating AlphaGo by a score of      at least     and accepted the challenge in only five minutes  He also stated  Of course  there would have been many updates in the last four or five months  but that isn t enough time to challenge me              
On   March  Lee played black and lost the first game by resignation              On    March  he played white and lost the second game by resignation              On    March  he played black and lost the third game as well              On    March  he played white and won the fourth game  following an unexpected move at White    described as  a brilliant tesuji   and by Gu Li   dan as a  divine move  and completely unforeseen by him  GoGameGuru commented that this game was  a masterpiece for Lee Sedol and will almost certainly become a famous game in the history of Go               Lee commented after the victory that he considered AlphaGo was strongest when playing white  second   For this reason  and because he thought winning a second time with black would be more valuable than winning with white  he requested that he play black in the final fifth game  which is considered more risky when following Chinese Go rules              On    March  he played black and lost the fifth game  to lose the Go series                 















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Game    Lee Sedol  white  v  AlphaGo  black  First    moves

After his fourth match victory  Lee was overjoyed   I don t think I ve ever felt so good after winning just one match  I remember when I said I will win all or lose just one game in the beginning  If this had really happened   I won   rounds and lost this round   it would have had a great bearing on my reputation  However  since I won after losing   games in a row  I am so happy  I will never exchange this win for anything in the world               He added   I  Lee Se dol  lost  but mankind did not               After the last match  however  Lee was saddened   I failed  I feel sorry that the match is over and it ended like this  I wanted it to end well   He also confessed that  As a professional Go player  I never want to play this kind of match again  I endured the match because I accepted it              

Retirement from professional play edit 
On    November       Lee Sedol announced his retirement from professional play  stating that  Even if I become the number one  there is an entity that cannot be defeated
