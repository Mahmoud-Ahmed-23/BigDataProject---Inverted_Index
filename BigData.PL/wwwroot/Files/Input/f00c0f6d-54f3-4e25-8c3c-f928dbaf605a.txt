Programming language used in many domains
In computer software  a general purpose programming language  GPL  is a programming language for building software in a wide variety of application domains  Conversely  a domain specific programming language  DSL  is used within a specific area  For example  Python is a GPL  while SQL is a DSL for querying relational databases 


History edit 
Early programming languages were designed for scientific computing  numerical calculations  or commercial data processing  as was computer hardware  Scientific languages such as Fortran and Algol supported floating point calculations and multidimensional arrays  while business languages such as COBOL supported fixed field file formats and data records  Much less widely used were specialized languages such as IPL V and LISP for symbolic list processing  COMIT for string manipulation  APT for numerically controlled machines  Systems programming requiring pointer manipulation was typically done in assembly language  though JOVIAL was used for some military applications            
IBM s System      announced in       was designed as a unified hardware architecture supporting both scientific and commercial applications  and IBM developed PL I for it as a single  general purpose language that supported scientific  commercial  and systems programming  Indeed  a subset of PL I was used as the standard systems programming language for the Multics operating system 
Since PL I  the distinction between scientific and commercial programming languages has diminished  with most languages supporting the basic features required by both  and much of the special file format handling delegated to specialized database management systems 
Many specialized languages were also developed starting in the     s  GPSS and Simula for discrete event simulation  MAD  BASIC  Logo  and Pascal for teaching programming  C for systems programming  JOSS and APL     for interactive programming            

GPL vs  DSL edit 
The distinction between general purpose programming languages and domain specific programming languages is not always clear             A programming language may be created for a specific task  but used beyond that original domain and thus be considered a general purpose programming language  For example  COBOL  Fortran  and Lisp were created as DSLs  for business processing  numeric computation  and symbolic processing   but became GPL s over time      dubious             discuss      Inversely  a language may be designed for general use but only applied in a specific area in practice             A programming language that is well suited for a problem  whether it be general purpose language or DSL  should minimize the level of detail required while still being expressive enough in the problem domain             As the name suggests  general purpose language is  general  in that it cannot provide support for domain specific notation while DSLs can be designed in diverse problem domains to handle this problem             General purpose languages are preferred to DSLs when an application domain is not well understood enough to warrant its own language  In this case  a general purpose language with an appropriate library of data types and functions for the domain may be used instead             While DSLs are usually smaller than GPL in that they offer a smaller range of notations of abstractions  some DSLs actually contain an entire GPL as a sublanguage  In these instances  the DSLs are able to offer domain specific expressive power along with the expressive power of GPL            
General Purpose programming languages are all Turing complete  meaning that they can theoretically solve any computational problem  Domain specific languages are often similarly Turing complete but are not exclusively so 

Advantages and disadvantages edit 
General purpose programming languages are more commonly used by programmers  According to a study  C  Python  and Java were the most commonly used programming languages in                  One argument in favor of using general purpose programming languages over domain specific languages is that more people will be familiar with these languages  overcoming the need to learn a new language 
Additionally  for many tasks  e g   statistical analysis  machine learning  etc   there are libraries that are extensively tested and optimized  Theoretically  the presence of these libraries should bridge the gap between general purpose and domain specific languages            
An empirical study in      sought to measure problem solving and productivity between GPLs and DSLs by giving users problems who were familiar with the GPL  C   and unfamiliar with the DSL  XAML   Ultimately  users of this specific domain specific language performed better by a factor of      even though they were more familiar with GPL  warranting further research            

Examples edit 
C edit 
The predecessor to C  B  was developed largely for a specific purpose  systems programming             By contrast  C has found use in a variety of computational domains  such as operating systems  device drivers  application software  and embedded systems 
C is suitable for use in a variety of areas because of its generality  It provides economy of expression  flow control  data structures  and a rich set of operators  but does not constrain its users to use it in any one context             As a result  though it was first used by its creators to rewrite the kernel of the Unix operating system              it was easily adapted for use in application development  embedded systems  e g   microprocessor programming   video games  e g   Doom   and so on  Today  C remains one of the most popular and widely used programming languages             

C   edit 
Conceived as an extension to C  C   introduced object oriented features  as well as other conveniences like references  operator overloading  and default arguments  Like C  C   s generality allowed it to be used in a wide range of areas  While its C   s core area of application is in systems programming  because of C   s ability to grant access to low level architecture               it has been used extensively to build desktop applications  video games  databases  financial systems  and much more              Major software and finance companies  such as Microsoft  Apple  Bloomberg  and Morgan Stanley  still widely use C   in their internal and external applications             

Python edit 
Python was conceived as a language that emphasized code readability and extensibility                          The former allowed non software engineers to easily learn and write computer programs  while the latter allowed domain specialists to easily create libraries suited to their own use cases  For these reasons  Python has been used across a wide range of domains 
Some areas where Python is used include             

Web development   Frameworks like Django and Flask have allowed web developers to create robust web servers that can also exploit the wider Python ecosystem 
Science and academia   Scientific and data libraries  like SciPy and Pandas  have enabled Python s use in scientific research             
Machine learning   Libraries like scikit learn and TensorFlow have made machine learning more accessible to developers             
General software development   Developing user applications  web scraping programs  games  and other general software
