A facial recognition system            is a technology potentially capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces  Such a system is typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services  and works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image            
Development began on similar systems in the     s  beginning as a form of computer application  Since their inception  facial recognition systems have seen wider uses in recent times on smartphones and in other forms of technology  such as robotics  Because computerized facial recognition involves the measurement of a human s physiological characteristics  facial recognition systems are categorized as biometrics  Although the accuracy of facial recognition systems as a biometric technology is lower than iris recognition  fingerprint image acquisition  palm recognition or voice recognition  it is widely adopted due to its contactless process             Facial recognition systems have been deployed in advanced human computer interaction  video surveillance  law enforcement  passenger screening  decisions on employment and housing and automatic indexing of images                       
Facial recognition systems are employed throughout the world today by governments and private companies             Their effectiveness varies  and some systems have previously been scrapped because of their ineffectiveness  The use of facial recognition systems has also raised controversy  with claims that the systems violate citizens  privacy  commonly make incorrect identifications  encourage gender norms                       and racial profiling             and do not protect important biometric data  The appearance of synthetic media such as deepfakes has also raised concerns about its security              These claims have led to the ban of facial recognition systems in several cities in the United States              Growing societal concerns led social networking company Meta Platforms to shut down its Facebook facial recognition system in       deleting the face scan data of more than one billion users                          The change represented one of the largest shifts in facial recognition usage in the technology s history  IBM also stopped offering facial recognition technology due to similar concerns             


History of facial recognition technology edit 
Automated facial recognition was pioneered in the     s by Woody Bledsoe  Helen Chan Wolf  and Charles Bisson  whose work focused on teaching computers to recognize human faces              Their early facial recognition project was dubbed  man machine  because a human first needed to establish the coordinates of facial features in a photograph before they could be used by a computer for recognition  Using a graphics tablet  a human would pinpoint facial features coordinates  such as the pupil centers  the inside and outside corners of eyes  and the widows peak in the hairline  The coordinates were used to calculate    individual distances  including the width of the mouth and of the eyes  A human could process about    pictures an hour  building a database of these computed distances  A computer would then automatically compare the distances for each photograph  calculate the difference between the distances  and return the closed records as a possible match             
In       Takeo Kanade publicly demonstrated a face matching system that located anatomical features such as the chin and calculated the distance ratio between facial features without human intervention  Later tests revealed that the system could not always reliably identify facial features  Nonetheless  interest in the subject grew and in      Kanade published the first detailed book on facial recognition technology             
In       the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency  DARPA  and the Army Research Laboratory  ARL  established the face recognition technology program FERET to develop  automatic face recognition capabilities  that could be employed in a productive real life environment  to assist security  intelligence  and law enforcement personnel in the performance of their duties   Face recognition systems that had been trialled in research labs were evaluated  The FERET tests found that while the performance of existing automated facial recognition systems varied  a handful of existing methods could viably be used to recognize faces in still images taken in a controlled environment              The FERET tests spawned three US companies that sold automated facial recognition systems  Vision Corporation and Miros Inc were founded in       by researchers who used the results of the FERET tests as a selling point  Viisage Technology was established by an identification card defense contractor in      to commercially exploit the rights to the facial recognition algorithm developed by Alex Pentland at MIT             
Following the      FERET face recognition vendor test  the Department of Motor Vehicles  DMV  offices in West Virginia and New Mexico became the first DMV offices to use automated facial recognition systems to prevent people from obtaining multiple driving licenses using different names  Driver s licenses in the United States were at that point a commonly accepted form of photo identification  DMV offices across the United States were undergoing a technological upgrade and were in the process of establishing databases of digital ID photographs  This enabled DMV offices to deploy the facial recognition systems on the market to search photographs for new driving licenses against the existing DMV database              DMV offices became one of the first major markets for automated facial recognition technology and introduced US citizens to facial recognition as a standard method of identification              The increase of the US prison population in the     s prompted U S  states to established connected and automated identification systems that incorporated digital biometric databases  in some instances this included facial recognition  In       Minnesota incorporated the facial recognition system FaceIT by Visionics into a mug shot booking system that allowed police  judges and court officers to track criminals across the state             

In this shear mapping the red arrow changes direction  but the blue arrow does not and is used as eigenvector 
The Viola Jones algorithm for face detection uses Haar like features to locate faces in an image  Here a Haar feature that looks similar to the bridge of the nose is applied onto the face 
Until the     s  facial recognition systems were developed primarily by using photographic portraits of human faces  Research on face recognition to reliably locate a face in an image that contains other objects gained traction in the early     s with the principal component analysis  PCA   The PCA method of face detection is also known as Eigenface and was developed by Matthew Turk and Alex Pentland              Turk and Pentland combined the conceptual approach of the Karhunen Lo ve theorem and factor analysis  to develop a linear model  Eigenfaces are determined based on global and orthogonal features in human faces  A human face is calculated as a weighted combination of a number of Eigenfaces  Because few Eigenfaces were used to encode human faces of a given population  Turk and Pentland s PCA face detection method greatly reduced the amount of data that had to be processed to detect a face  Pentland in      defined Eigenface features  including eigen eyes  eigen mouths and eigen noses  to advance the use of PCA in facial recognition  In       the PCA Eigenface method of face recognition             was improved upon using linear discriminant analysis  LDA  to produce Fisherfaces              LDA Fisherfaces became dominantly used in PCA feature based face recognition  While Eigenfaces were also used for face reconstruction  In these approaches no global structure of the face is calculated which links the facial features or parts             
Purely feature based approaches to facial recognition were overtaken in the late     s by the Bochum system  which used Gabor filter to record the face features and computed a grid of the face structure to link the features              Christoph von der Malsburg and his research team at the University of Bochum developed Elastic Bunch Graph Matching in the mid     s to extract a face out of an image using skin segmentation              By       the face detection method developed by Malsburg outperformed most other facial detection systems on the market  The so called  Bochum system  of face detection was sold commercially on the market as ZN Face to operators of airports and other busy locations  The software was  robust enough to make identifications from less than perfect face views  It can also often see through such impediments to identification as mustaches  beards  changed hairstyles and glasses even sunglasses              
Real time face detection in video footage became possible in      with the Viola Jones object detection framework for faces              Paul Viola and Michael Jones combined their face detection method with the Haar like feature approach to object recognition in digital images to launch AdaBoost  the first real time frontal view face detector              By       the Viola Jones algorithm had been implemented using small low power detectors on handheld devices and embedded systems  Therefore  the Viola Jones algorithm has not only broadened the practical application of face recognition systems but has also been used to support new features in user interfaces and teleconferencing             
Ukraine is using the US based Clearview AI facial recognition software to identify dead Russian soldiers  Ukraine has conducted       searches and identified the families of     deceased Russian soldiers  The IT volunteer section of the Ukrainian army using the software is subsequently contacting the families of the deceased soldiers to raise awareness of Russian activities in Ukraine  The main goal is to destabilise the Russian government  It can be seen as a form of psychological warfare  About     Ukrainian government officials in five government ministries are using the technology  It is used to catch spies that might try to enter Ukraine             
Clearview AI s facial recognition database is only available to government agencies who may only use the technology to assist in the course of law enforcement investigations or in connection with national security             
The software was donated to Ukraine by Clearview AI  Russia is thought to be using it to find anti war activists  Clearview AI was originally designed for US law enforcement  Using it in war raises new ethical concerns  One London based surveillance expert  Stephen Hare  is concerned it might make the Ukrainians appear inhuman   Is it actually working  Or is it making  Russians  say   Look at these lawless  cruel Ukrainians  doing this to our boys               

Techniques for face recognition edit 
Automatic face detection with OpenCV 
While humans can recognize faces without much effort              facial recognition is a challenging pattern recognition problem in computing  Facial recognition systems attempt to identify a human face  which is three dimensional and changes in appearance with lighting and facial expression  based on its two dimensional image  To accomplish this computational task  facial recognition systems perform four steps  First face detection is used to segment the face from the image background  In the second step the segmented face image is aligned to account for face pose  image size and photographic properties  such as illumination and grayscale  The purpose of the alignment process is to enable the accurate localization of facial features in the third step  the facial feature extraction  Features such as eyes  nose and mouth are pinpointed and measured in the image to represent the face  The so established feature vector of the face is then  in the fourth step  matched against a database of faces             

Traditional edit 
Some eigenfaces from AT amp T Laboratories Cambridge
Some face recognition algorithms identify facial features by extracting landmarks  or features  from an image of the subject s face  For example  an algorithm may analyze the relative position  size  and or shape of the eyes  nose  cheekbones  and jaw              These features are then used to search for other images with matching features             
Other algorithms normalize a gallery of face images and then compress the face data  only saving the data in the image that is useful for face recognition  A probe image is then compared with the face data              One of the earliest successful systems             is based on template matching techniques             applied to a set of salient facial features  providing a sort of compressed face representation 
Recognition algorithms can be divided into two main approaches  geometric  which looks at distinguishing features  or photo metric  which is a statistical approach that distills an image into values and compares the values with templates to eliminate variances  Some classify these algorithms into two broad categories  holistic and feature based models  The former attempts to recognize the face in its entirety while the feature based subdivide into components such as according to features and analyze each as well as its spatial location with respect to other features             
Popular recognition algorithms include principal component analysis using eigenfaces  linear discriminant analysis  elastic bunch graph matching using the Fisherface algorithm  the hidden Markov model  the multilinear subspace learning using tensor representation  and the neuronal motivated dynamic link matching      citation needed                  Modern facial recognition systems make increasing use of machine learning techniques such as deep learning             

Human identification at a distance  HID  edit 
To enable human identification at a distance  HID  low resolution images of faces are enhanced using face hallucination  In CCTV imagery faces are often very small  But because facial recognition algorithms that identify and plot facial features require high resolution images  resolution enhancement techniques have been developed to enable facial recognition systems to work with imagery that has been captured in environments with a high signal to noise ratio  Face hallucination algorithms that are applied to images prior to those images being submitted to the facial recognition system use example based machine learning with pixel substitution or nearest neighbour distribution indexes that may also incorporate demographic and age related facial characteristics  Use of face hallucination techniques improves the performance of high resolution facial recognition algorithms and may be used to overcome the inherent limitations of super resolution algorithms  Face hallucination techniques are also used to pre treat imagery where faces are disguised  Here the disguise  such as sunglasses  is removed and the face hallucination algorithm is applied to the image  Such face hallucination algorithms need to be trained on similar face images with and without disguise  To fill in the area uncovered by removing the disguise  face hallucination algorithms need to correctly map the entire state of the face  which may be not possible due to the momentary facial expression captured in the low resolution image             

  dimensional recognition edit 
 D model of a human face
Three dimensional face recognition technique uses  D sensors to capture information about the shape of a face  This information is then used to identify distinctive features on the surface of a face  such as the contour of the eye sockets  nose  and chin             
One advantage of  D face recognition is that it is not affected by changes in lighting like other techniques  It can also identify a face from a range of viewing angles  including a profile view                          Three dimensional data points from a face vastly improve the precision of face recognition   D dimensional face recognition research is enabled by the development of sophisticated sensors that project structured light onto the face               D matching technique are sensitive to expressions  therefore researchers at Technion applied tools from metric geometry to treat expressions as isometries              A new method of capturing  D images of faces uses three tracking cameras that point at different angles  one camera will be pointing at the front of the subject  second one to the side  and third one at an angle  All these cameras will work together so it can track a subject s face in real time and be able to face detect and recognize             

Thermal cameras edit

A different form of taking input data for face recognition is by using thermal cameras  by this procedure the cameras will only detect the shape of the head and it will ignore the subject accessories such as glasses  hats  or makeup              Unlike conventional cameras  thermal cameras can capture facial imagery even in low light and nighttime conditions without using a flash and exposing the position of the camera              However  the databases for face recognition are limited  Efforts to build databases of thermal face images date back to                   By       several databases existed  including the IIITD PSE and the Notre Dame thermal face database              Current thermal face recognition systems are not able to reliably detect a face in a thermal image that has been taken of an outdoor environment             
In       researchers from the U S  Army Research Laboratory  ARL  developed a technique that would allow them to match facial imagery obtained using a thermal camera with those in databases that were captured using a conventional camera              Known as a cross spectrum synthesis method due to how it bridges facial recognition from two different imaging modalities  this method synthesize a single image by analyzing multiple facial regions and details              It consists of a non linear regression model that maps a specific thermal image into a corresponding visible facial image and an optimization issue that projects the latent projection back into the image space              ARL scientists have noted that the approach works by combining global information  i e  features across the entire face  with local information  i e  features regarding the eyes  nose  and mouth               According to performance tests conducted at ARL  the multi region cross spectrum synthesis model demonstrated a performance improvement of about     over baseline methods and about    over state of the art methods             

Application edit 
Social media edit 
Founded in       Looksery went on to raise money for its face modification app on Kickstarter  After successful crowdfunding  Looksery launched in October       The application allows video chat with others through a special filter for faces that modifies the look of users  Image augmenting applications already on the market  such as Facetune and Perfect     were limited to static images  whereas Looksery allowed augmented reality to live videos  In late      SnapChat purchased Looksery  which would then become its landmark lenses function              Snapchat filter applications use face detection technology and on the basis of the facial features identified in an image a  D mesh mask is layered over the face              A variety of technologies attempt to fool facial recognition software by the use of anti facial recognition masks             
DeepFace is a deep learning facial recognition system created by a research group at Facebook  It identifies human faces in digital images  It employs a nine layer neural net with over     million connection weights  and was trained on four million images uploaded by Facebook users                          The system is said to be     accurate  compared to     for the FBI s Next Generation Identification system             
TikTok s algorithm has been regarded as especially effective  but many were left to wonder at the exact programming that caused the app to be so effective in guessing the user s desired content              In June       TikTok released a statement regarding the  For You  page  and how they recommended videos to users  which did not include facial recognition              In February       however  TikTok agreed to a          million settlement to a US lawsuit which alleged that the app had used facial recognition in both user videos and its algorithm to identify age  gender and ethnicity             

ID verification edit 
The emerging use of facial recognition is in the use of ID verification services  Many companies and others are working in the market now to provide these services to banks  ICOs  and other e businesses              Face recognition has been leveraged as a form of biometric authentication for various computing platforms and devices              Android      Ice Cream Sandwich  added facial recognition using a smartphone s front camera as a means of unlocking devices                          while Microsoft introduced face recognition login to its Xbox     video game console through its Kinect accessory              as well as Windows    via its  Windows Hello  platform  which requires an infrared illuminated camera               In       Apple s iPhone X smartphone introduced facial recognition to the product line with its  Face ID  platform  which uses an infrared illumination system             

Face ID edit 
Apple introduced Face ID on the flagship iPhone X as a biometric authentication successor to the Touch ID  a fingerprint based system  Face ID has a facial recognition sensor that consists of two parts  a  Romeo  module that projects more than        infrared dots onto the user s face  and a  Juliet  module that reads the pattern              The pattern is sent to a local  Secure Enclave  in the device s central processing unit  CPU  to confirm a match with the phone owner s face             
The facial pattern is not accessible by Apple  The system will not work with eyes closed  in an effort to prevent unauthorized access              The technology learns from changes in a user s appearance  and therefore works with hats  scarves  glasses  and many sunglasses  beard and makeup              It also works in the dark  This is done by using a  Flood Illuminator   which is a dedicated infrared flash that throws out invisible infrared light onto the user s face to properly read the        facial points             

Healthcare edit 
Facial recognition algorithms can help in diagnosing some diseases using specific features on the nose  cheeks and other part of the human face              Relying on developed data sets  machine learning has been used to identify genetic abnormalities just based on facial dimensions              FRT has also been used to verify patients before surgery procedures 
In March       according to a publication by Forbes  FDNA  an AI development company claimed that in the space of    years  they have worked with geneticists to develop a database of about       diseases and      of them can be detected with facial recognition algorithms             

Deployment of FRT for availing government services edit 
India edit 
In an interview  the National Health Authority chief Dr  R S  Sharma said that facial recognition technology would be used in conjunction with Aadhaar to authenticate the identity of people seeking vaccines              Ten human rights and digital rights organizations and more than     individuals signed a statement by the Internet Freedom Foundation that raised alarm against the deployment of facial recognition technology in the central government s vaccination drive process              Implementation of an error prone system without adequate legislation containing mandatory safeguards  would deprive citizens of essential services and linking this untested technology to the vaccination roll out in India will only exclude persons from the vaccine delivery system             
In July        a press release by the Government of Meghalaya stated that facial recognition technology  FRT  would be used to verify the identity of pensioners to issue a Digital Life Certificate using  Pensioner s Life Certification Verification  mobile application              The notice  according to the press release  purports to offer pensioners  a secure  easy and hassle free interface for verifying their liveness to the Pension Disbursing Authorities from the comfort of their homes using smart phones   Mr  Jade Jeremiah Lyngdoh  a law student  sent a legal notice to the relevant authorities highlighting that  The application has been rolled out without any anchoring legislation which governs the processing of personal data and thus  lacks lawfulness and the Government is not empowered to process data

Even though facial recognition technology  FRT  is not fully accurate               it is being increasingly deployed for identification purposes by the police in India  FRT systems generate a probability match score  or a confidence score between the suspect who is to be identified and the database of identified criminals that is available with the police  The National Automated Facial Recognition System  AFRS               is already being developed by the National Crime Records Bureau  NCRB   a body constituted under the Ministry of Home Affairs  The project seeks to develop and deploy a national database of photographs which would comport with a facial recognition technology system by the central and state security agencies  The Internet Freedom Foundation has flagged concerns regarding the project               The NGO has highlighted that the accuracy of FRT systems are  routinely exaggerated and the real numbers leave much to be desired               The implementation of such faulty FRT systems would lead to high rates of false positives and false negatives in this recognition process        
Under the Supreme Court of India s decision in Justice K S  Puttaswamy vs Union of India           SCC     any justifiable intrusion by the State into people s right to privacy  which is protected as a fundamental right under Article    of the Constitution  must confirm to certain thresholds  namely  legality  necessity  proportionality and procedural safeguards               As per the Internet Freedom Foundation  the National Automated Facial Recognition System  AFRS  proposal fails to meet any of these thresholds  citing  absence of legality    manifest arbitrariness   and  absence of safeguards and accountability               
While the national level AFRS project is still in the works  police departments in various states in India are already deploying facial recognition technology systems  such as  TSCOP   CCTNS in Telangana               Punjab Artificial Intelligence System  PAIS  in Punjab               Trinetra in Uttar Pradesh               Police Artificial Intelligence System in Uttarakhand               AFRS in Delhi  Automated Multimodal Biometric Identification System  AMBIS  in Maharashtra  FaceTagr in Tamil Nadu  The Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems  CCTNS   which is a Mission Mode Project under the National e Governance Plan  NeGP                is viewed as a system which would connect police stations across India  and help them  talk               to each other  The project s objective is to digitize all FIR related information  including FIRs registered  as well as cases investigated  charge sheets filed  and suspects and wanted persons in all police stations  This shall constitute a national database of crime and criminals in India  CCTNS is being implemented without a data protection law in place  CCTNS is proposed to be integrated with the AFRS  a repository of all crime and criminal related facial data which can be deployed to purportedly identify or verify a person from a variety of inputs ranging from images to videos               This has raised privacy concerns from civil society organizations and privacy experts  Both the projects have been censured as instruments of  mass surveillance  at the hands of the state               In Rajasthan   RajCop   a police app has been recently integrated with a facial recognition module which can match the face of a suspect against a database of known persons in real time  Rajasthan police is in currently working to widen the ambit of this module by making it mandatory to upload photographs of all arrested persons in CCTNS database  which will  help develop a rich database of known offenders               
Helmets fixed with camera have been designed and being used by Rajasthan police in law and order situations to capture police action and activities of  the miscreants  which can later serve as evidence during the investigation of such cases                PAIS  Punjab Artificial Intelligence System   App employs deep learning  machine learning  and face recognition for the identification of criminals to assist police personnel               The state of Telangana has installed   lakh CCTV cameras               with its capital city Hyderabad slowly turning into a surveillance capital              
A false positive happens when facial recognition technology misidentifies a person to be someone they are not  that is  it yields an incorrect positive result  They often results in discrimination and strengthening of existing biases  For example  in       Delhi Police reported that its FRT system had an accuracy rate of     which sank to    in       The FRT system even failed to distinguish accurately between different sexes              
The government of Delhi in collaboration with Indian Space Research Organisation  ISRO  is developing a new technology called Crime Mapping Analytics and Predictive System  CMAPS   The project aims to deploy space technology for  controlling crime and maintaining law and order                The system will be connected to a database containing data of criminals               The technology is envisaged to be deployed to collect real time data at the crime scene              
In a reply dated November          to a Right to Information request filed by the Internet Freedom Foundation seeking information about the facial recognition system being used by the Delhi Police  with reference number DEPOL R E                         the Office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police cum Public Information Officer  Crime stated that they cannot provide the information under section   d  of the Right to Information Act                    
A Right to Information  RTI  request dated July          was filed with the Office of the Commissioner  Kolkata Police  seeking information about the facial recognition technology that the department was using               The information sought was denied              stating that the department was exempted from disclosure under section       of the RTI Act 

Latin America edit 
In the      Mexican presidential election  the Mexican government employed face recognition software to prevent voter fraud  Some individuals had been registering to vote under several different names  in an attempt to place multiple votes  By comparing new face images to those already in the voter database  authorities were able to reduce duplicate registrations              
In Colombia public transport busses are fitted with a facial recognition system by FaceFirst Inc to identify passengers that are sought by the National Police of Colombia  FaceFirst Inc also built the facial recognition system for Tocumen International Airport in Panama  The face recognition system is deployed to identify individuals among the travellers that are sought by the Panamanian National Police or Interpol               Tocumen International Airport operates an airport wide surveillance system using hundreds of live face recognition cameras to identify wanted individuals passing through the airport  The face recognition system was initially installed as part of a US         million contract and included a computer cluster of sixty computers  a fiber optic cable network for the airport buildings  as well as the installation of     surveillance cameras in the airport terminal and at about    airport gates              
At the      FIFA World Cup in Brazil the Federal Police of Brazil used face recognition goggles  Face recognition systems  made in China  were also deployed at the      Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro               Nuctech Company provided     inspection terminals for Maracan  Stadium and    terminals for the Deodoro Olympic Park              

European Union edit 
Police forces in at least    countries of the European Union use  or plan to use  facial recognition systems  either for administrative or criminal purposes              

Greece edit 
Greek police passed a contract with Intracom Telecom for the provision of at least       devices equipped with live facial recognition system  The delivery is expected before the summer       The total value of the contract is over   million euros  paid for in large part by the Internal Security Fund of the European Commission              

Italy edit 
Italian police acquired a face recognition system in       Sistema Automatico Riconoscimento Immagini  SARI   In November       the Interior ministry announced plans to use it in real time to identify people suspected of seeking asylum              

The Netherlands edit 
The Netherlands has deployed facial recognition and artificial intelligence technology since                    The database of the Dutch police currently contains over          million pictures of          million Dutch citizens  This accounts for about    of the population  In The Netherlands  face recognition is not used by the police on municipal CCTV              

South Africa edit 
In South Africa  in       the city of Johannesburg announced it was rolling out smart CCTV cameras complete with automatic number plate recognition and facial recognition              

Deployment in retail stores edit 
The US firm  VR  now Identiv  is an example of a vendor which began offering facial recognition systems and services to retailers as early as                    In       the company advertised benefits such as  dwell and queue line analytics to decrease customer wait times    facial surveillance analytic s  to facilitate personalized customer greetings by employees  and the ability to   c reate loyalty programs by combining Point of sale  POS  data with facial recognition               

United States edit 
In       the National Retail Federation Loss Prevention Research Council called facial recognition technology  a promising new tool  worth evaluating              
In July       the Reuters news agency reported that during the     s the pharmacy chain Rite Aid had deployed facial recognition video surveillance systems and components from FaceFirst  DeepCam LLC  and other vendors at some retail locations in the United States               Cathy Langley  Rite Aid s vice president of asset protection  used the phrase  feature matching  to refer to the systems and said that usage of the systems resulted in less violence and organized crime in the company s stores  while former vice president of asset protection Bob Oberosler emphasized improved safety for staff and a reduced need for the involvement of law enforcement organizations               In a      statement to Reuters in response to the reporting  Rite Aid said that it had ceased using the facial recognition software and switched off the cameras              
According to director Read Hayes of the National Retail Federation Loss Prevention Research Council  Rite Aid s surveillance program was either the largest or one of the largest programs in retail               The Home Depot  Menards  Walmart  and   Eleven are among other US retailers also engaged in large scale pilot programs or deployments of facial recognition technology              
Of the Rite Aid stores examined by Reuters in       those in communities where people of color made up the largest racial or ethnic group were three times as likely to have the technology installed               raising concerns related to the substantial history of racial segregation and racial profiling in the United States  Rite Aid said that the selection of locations was  data driven   based on the theft histories of individual stores  local and national crime data  and site infrastructure              

Australia edit 
In       facial recognition to prevent theft was in use at Sydney s Star Casino and was also deployed at gaming venues in New Zealand              
In June       consumer group CHOICE reported facial recognition was in use in Australia at Kmart  Bunnings  and The Good Guys  The Good Guys subsequently suspended the technology pending a legal challenge by CHOICE to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner  while Bunnings kept the technology in use and Kmart maintained its trial of the technology              

Additional uses edit 
Disney s Magic Kingdom  near Orlando  Florida  during a trial of a facial recognition technology for park entry
At the American football championship game Super Bowl XXXV in January       police in Tampa Bay  Florida used Viisage face recognition software to search for potential criminals and terrorists in attendance at the event     people with minor criminal records were potentially identified                           
Face recognition systems have also been used by photo management software to identify the subjects of photographs  enabling features such as searching images by person  as well as suggesting photos to be shared with a specific contact if their presence were detected in a photo                            By      facial recognition systems were typically used as access control in security systems              
The United States  popular music and country music celebrity Taylor Swift surreptitiously employed facial recognition technology at a concert in       The camera was embedded in a kiosk near a ticket booth and scanned concert goers as they entered the facility for known stalkers              
On August           The Times reported that the UAE owned Manchester City hired a Texas based firm  Blink Identity  to deploy facial recognition systems in a driver program  The club has planned a single super fast lane for the supporters at the Etihad stadium               However  civil rights groups cautioned the club against the introduction of this technology  saying that it would risk  normalising a mass surveillance tool   The policy and campaigns officer at Liberty  Hannah Couchman said that Man City s move is alarming  since the fans will be obliged to share deeply sensitive personal information with a private company  where they could be tracked and monitored in their everyday lives              
In       casinos in Australia and New Zealand rolled out facial recognition to prevent theft  and a representative of Sydney s Star Casino said they would also provide  customer service  like welcoming a patron back to a bar              
In August       amid the COVID    pandemic in the United States  American football stadiums of New York and Los Angeles announced the installation of facial recognition for upcoming matches  The purpose is to make the entry process as touchless as possible               Disney s Magic Kingdom  near Orlando  Florida  likewise announced a test of facial recognition technology to create a touchless experience during the pandemic  the test was originally slated to take place between March    and April           but the limited timeframe had been removed as of late     April                update                  
Media companies have begun using face recognition technology to streamline their tracking  organizing  and archiving pictures and videos              

Advantages and disadvantages edit 
Compared to other biometric systems edit 
In       the performance of the latest face recognition algorithms was evaluated in the Face Recognition Grand Challenge  FRGC   High resolution face images    D face scans  and iris images were used in the tests  The results indicated that the new algorithms are    times more accurate than the face recognition algorithms of      and     times more accurate than those of       Some of the algorithms were able to outperform human participants in recognizing faces and could uniquely identify identical twins                          
One key advantage of a facial recognition system that it is able to perform mass identification as it does not require the cooperation of the test subject to work  Properly designed systems installed in airports  multiplexes  and other public places can identify individuals among the crowd  without passers by even being aware of the system               However  as compared to other biometric techniques  face recognition may not be most reliable and efficient  Quality measures are very important in facial recognition systems as large degrees of variations are possible in face images  Factors such as illumination  expression  pose and noise during face capture can affect the performance of facial recognition systems               Among all biometric systems  facial recognition has the highest false acceptance and rejection rates               thus questions have been raised on the effectiveness of or bias of face recognition software in cases of railway and airport security  law enforcement and housing and employment decisions                         

Weaknesses edit 
Ralph Gross  a researcher at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute in       describes one obstacle related to the viewing angle of the face   Face recognition has been getting pretty good at full frontal faces and    degrees off  but as soon as you go towards profile  there ve been problems               Besides the pose variations  low resolution face images are also very hard to recognize  This is one of the main obstacles of face recognition in surveillance systems               It has also been suggested that camera settings can favour sharper imagery of white skin than of other skin tones            
Face recognition is less effective if facial expressions vary  A big smile can render the system less effective  For instance  Canada  in       allowed only neutral facial expressions in passport photos              
There is also inconstancy in the datasets used by researchers  Researchers may use anywhere from several subjects to scores of subjects and a few hundred images to thousands of images  Data sets may be diverse and inclusive or mainly contain images of white males  It is important for researchers to make available the datasets they used to each other  or have at least a standard or representative dataset              
Although high degrees of accuracy have been claimed for some facial recognition systems  these outcomes are not universal  The consistently worst accuracy rate is for those who are    to    years old  Black and female            

Racial bias and skin tone edit 
Studies have shown that facial recognition algorithms tend to perform better on individuals with lighter skin tones compared to those with darker skin tones  This disparity arises primarily because training datasets often overrepresent lighter skinned individuals  leading to higher error rates for darker skinned people  For example  a      study found that leading commercial gender classification models  which are facial recognition models  have an error rate up to   times higher for those with darker skin tones compared to those with lighter skin tones              
Common image compression methods  such as JPEG chroma subsampling  have been found to disproportionately degrade performance for darker skinned individuals  These methods inadequately represent color information  which adversely affects the ability of algorithms to recognize darker skinned individuals accurately              

Cross race effect bias edit 
Facial recognition systems often demonstrate lower accuracy when identifying individuals with non Eurocentric facial features  Known as the Cross race effect  this bias occurs when systems perform better on racial or ethnic groups that are overrepresented in their training data  resulting in reduced accuracy for underrepresented groups               The overrepresented group is generally the more populous group in the location that the model is being developed  For example  models developed in Asian cultures generally perform better on Asian facial features than Eurocentric facial features due to overrepresentation in the developers training dataset  The opposite is observed in models developed in Eurocentric cultures              
The systems used for facial recognition often lack the sufficient training needed to fully recognize those features not of Eurocentric descent  When the training and databases for these Machine Learning  ML  models do not contain a diverse representation  the models fail to identify the missed population  adding to their racial biases             
The cross race effect is not exclusive to machines  humans also experience difficulty recognizing faces from racial or ethnic groups different from their own  This is an example of inherent human biases being perpetuated in training datasets               

Challenges for individuals with disabilities edit 
Facial recognition technologies encounter significant challenges when identifying individuals with disabilities  For instance  systems have been shown to perform worse when recognizing individuals with Down syndrome  often leading to increased false match rates  This is due to distinct facial structures associated with the condition that are not adequately represented in training datasets              
More broadly  facial recognition systems tend to overlook diverse physical characteristics related to disabilities  The lack of representative data for individuals with varying disabilities further emphasizes the need for inclusive algorithmic designs to mitigate bias and improve accuracy              
Additionally  facial expression recognition technologies often fail to accurately interpret the emotional states of individuals with intellectual disabilities  This shortcoming can hinder effective communication and interaction  underscoring the necessity for systems trained on diverse datasets that include individuals with intellectual disabilities              
Furthermore  biases in facial recognition algorithms can lead to discriminatory outcomes for people with disabilities  For example  certain facial features or asymmetries may result in misidentification or exclusion  highlighting the importance of developing accessible and fair biometric systems              

Advancements in fairness and mitigation strategies edit 
Efforts to address these biases include designing algorithms specifically for fairness  A notable study introduced a method to learn fair face representations by using a progressive cross transformer model               This approach highlights the importance of balancing accuracy across demographic groups while avoiding performance drops in specific populations 
Additionally  targeted dataset collection has been shown to improve racial equity in facial recognition systems  By prioritizing diverse data inputs  researchers demonstrated measurable reductions in performance disparities between racial groups              

Ineffectiveness edit 
Critics of the technology complain that the London Borough of Newham scheme has  as of           update      never recognized a single criminal  despite several criminals in the system s database living in the Borough and the system has been running for several years   Not once  as far as the police know  has Newham s automatic face recognition system spotted a live target                             This information seems to conflict with claims that the system was credited with a     reduction in crime  hence why it was rolled out to Birmingham also               
An experiment in      by the local police department in Tampa  Florida  had similarly disappointing results               A system at Boston s Logan Airport was shut down in      after failing to make any matches during a two year test period              
In       Facebook stated that in a standardized two option facial recognition test  its online system scored        accuracy  compared to the human benchmark of                    
Systems are often advertised as having accuracy near       this is misleading as the outcomes are not universal             The studies often use samples that are smaller and less diverse than would be necessary for large scale applications  Because facial recognition is not completely accurate  it creates a list of potential matches  A human operator must then look through these potential matches and studies show the operators pick the correct match out of the list only about half the time  This causes the issue of targeting the wrong suspect                          

Controversies edit 
Privacy violations edit 
Civil rights organizations and privacy campaigners such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation  Big Brother Watch and the ACLU express concern that privacy is being compromised by the use of surveillance technologies                                        Face recognition can be used not just to identify an individual  but also to unearth other personal data associated with an individual   such as other photos featuring the individual  blog posts  social media profiles  Internet behavior  and travel patterns               Concerns have been raised over who would have access to the knowledge of one s whereabouts and people with them at any given time               Moreover  individuals have limited ability to avoid or thwart face recognition tracking unless they hide their faces  This fundamentally changes the dynamic of day to day privacy by enabling any marketer  government agency  or random stranger to secretly collect the identities and associated personal information of any individual captured by the face recognition system               Consumers may not understand or be aware of what their data is being used for  which denies them the ability to consent to how their personal information gets shared              
In July       the United States Government Accountability Office conducted a Report to the Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Privacy  Technology and the Law  Committee on the Judiciary  U S  Senate  The report discussed facial recognition technology s commercial uses  privacy issues  and the applicable federal law  It states that previously  issues concerning facial recognition technology were discussed and represent the need for updating the privacy laws of the United States so that federal law continually matches the impact of advanced technologies  The report noted that some industry  government  and private organizations were in the process of developing  or have developed   voluntary privacy guidelines   These guidelines varied between the stakeholders  but their overall aim was to gain consent and inform citizens of the intended use of facial recognition technology  According to the report the voluntary privacy guidelines helped to counteract the privacy concerns that arise when citizens are unaware of how their personal data gets put to use              
In       Russian company NtechLab caused a privacy scandal in the international media when it launched the FindFace face recognition system with the promise that Russian users could take photos of strangers in the street and link them to a social media profile on the social media platform Vkontakte  VK                In December       Facebook rolled out a new feature that notifies a user when someone uploads a photo that includes what Facebook thinks is their face  even if they are not tagged  Facebook has attempted to frame the new functionality in a positive light  amidst prior backlashes               Facebook s head of privacy  Rob Sherman  addressed this new feature as one that gives people more control over their photos online   We ve thought about this as a really empowering feature   he says   There may be photos that exist that you don t know about                Facebook s DeepFace has become the subject of several class action lawsuits under the Biometric Information Privacy Act  with claims alleging that Facebook is collecting and storing face recognition data of its users without obtaining informed consent  in direct violation of the      Biometric Information Privacy Act  BIPA                The most recent case was dismissed in January      because the court lacked jurisdiction               In the US  surveillance companies such as Clearview AI are relying on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to data scrape user accounts on social media platforms for data that can be used in the development of facial recognition systems              
In       the Financial Times first reported that facial recognition software was in use in the King s Cross area of London               The development around London s King s Cross mainline station includes shops  offices  Google s UK HQ and part of St Martin s College  According to the UK Information Commissioner s Office   Scanning people s faces as they lawfully go about their daily lives  in order to identify them  is a potential threat to privacy that should concern us all                             The UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham launched an investigation into the use of the King s Cross facial recognition system  operated by the company Argent  In September      it was announced by Argent that facial recognition software would no longer be used at King s Cross  Argent claimed that the software had been deployed between May      and March      on two cameras covering a pedestrian street running through the centre of the development               In October       a report by the deputy London mayor Sophie Linden revealed that in a secret deal the Metropolitan Police had passed photos of seven people to Argent for use in their King s cross facial recognition system              
Automated Facial Recognition was trialled by the South Wales Police on multiple occasions between      and       The use of the technology was challenged in court by a private individual  Edward Bridges  with support from the charity Liberty  case known as R  Bridges  v Chief Constable South Wales Police   The case was heard in the Court of Appeal and a judgement was given in August                    The case argued that the use of Facial Recognition was a privacy violation on the basis that there was insufficient legal framework or proportionality in the use of Facial Recognition and that its use was in violation of the Data Protection Acts      and       The case was decided in favour of Bridges and did not award damages  The case was settled via a declaration of wrongdoing               In response to the case  the British Government has repeatedly attempted to pass a Bill regulating the use of Facial Recognition in public spaces  The proposed Bills have attempted to appoint a Commissioner with the ability to  regulate Facial Recognition use by Government Services in a similar manner to the Commissioner for CCTV  Such a Bill has yet to come into force  correct as of September               update                    
In January       New York Attorney General Letitia James asked for more information on the use of facial recognition technology from Madison Square Garden Entertainment following reports that the firm used it to block lawyers involved in litigation against the company from entering Madison Square Garden  She noted such a move would could go against federal  state  and local human rights laws              

Imperfect technology in law enforcement edit 
As of           update      it is still contested as to whether or not facial recognition technology works less accurately on people of color               One study by Joy Buolamwini  MIT Media Lab  and Timnit Gebru  Microsoft Research  found that the error rate for gender recognition for women of color within three commercial facial recognition systems ranged from       to      whereas for lighter skinned men it was between     and       Overall accuracy rates for identifying men         were higher than for women          and none of the systems accommodated a non binary understanding of gender               It also showed that the datasets used to train commercial facial recognition models were unrepresentative of the broader population and skewed toward lighter skinned males  However  another study showed that several commercial facial recognition software sold to law enforcement offices around the country had a lower false non match rate for black people than for white people              
Experts fear that face recognition systems may actually be hurting citizens the police claims they are trying to protect               It is considered an imperfect biometric  and in a study conducted by Georgetown University researcher Clare Garvie  she concluded that  there s no consensus in the scientific community that it provides a positive identification of somebody                It is believed that with such large margins of error in this technology  both legal advocates and facial recognition software companies say that the technology should only supply a portion of the case   no evidence that can lead to an arrest of an individual               The lack of regulations holding facial recognition technology companies to requirements of racially biased testing can be a significant flaw in the adoption of use in law enforcement  CyberExtruder  a company that markets itself to law enforcement said that they had not performed testing or research on bias in their software  CyberExtruder did note that some skin colors are more difficult for the software to recognize with current limitations of the technology   Just as individuals with very dark skin are hard to identify with high significance via facial recognition  individuals with very pale skin are the same   said Blake Senftner  a senior software engineer at CyberExtruder              
The United States  National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  carried out extensive testing of FRT system     verification              and   many identification               It also tested for the differing accuracy of FRT across different demographic groups  The independent study concluded at present  no FRT system has      accuracy              

Data protection edit 
In       Peru passed the Law for Personal Data Protection  which defines biometric information that can be used to identify an individual as sensitive data  In       Colombia passed a comprehensive Data Protection Law which defines biometric data as senstivite information               According to Article      of the EU s      General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR  the processing of biometric data for the purpose of  uniquely identifying a natural person  is sensitive and the facial recognition data processed in this way becomes sensitive personal data  In response to the GDPR passing into the law of EU member states  EU based researchers voiced concern that if they were required under the GDPR to obtain individual s consent for the processing of their facial recognition data  a face database on the scale of MegaFace could never be established again               In September      the Swedish Data Protection Authority  DPA  issued its first ever financial penalty for a violation of the EU s General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR  against a school that was using the technology to replace time consuming roll calls during class  The DPA found that the school illegally obtained the biometric data of its students without completing an impact assessment  In addition the school did not make the DPA aware of the pilot scheme  A         SEK fine                   was issued      citation needed     
In the United States of America several U S  states have passed laws to protect the privacy of biometric data  Examples include the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act  BIPA  and the California Consumer Privacy Act  CCPA                In March      California residents filed a class action against Clearview AI  alleging that the company had illegally collected biometric data online and with the help of face recognition technology built up a database of biometric data which was sold to companies and police forces  At the time Clearview AI already faced two lawsuits under BIPA              and an investigation by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada for compliance with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act  PIPEDA               

Bans on the use of facial recognition technology edit 
United States of America edit 
In May       San Francisco  California became the first major United States city to ban the use of facial recognition software for police and other local government agencies  usage               San Francisco Supervisor  Aaron Peskin  introduced regulations that will require agencies to gain approval from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to purchase surveillance technology               The regulations also require that agencies publicly disclose the intended use for new surveillance technology               In June       Somerville  Massachusetts became the first city on the East Coast to ban face surveillance software for government use               specifically in police investigations and municipal surveillance               In July       Oakland  California banned the usage of facial recognition technology by city departments              
The American Civil Liberties Union   ACLU   has campaigned across the United States for transparency in surveillance technology              and has supported both San Francisco and Somerville s ban on facial recognition software  The ACLU works to challenge the secrecy and surveillance with this technology      citation needed                  
During the George Floyd protests  use of facial recognition by city government was banned in Boston  Massachusetts               As of June                        update      municipal use has been banned in

The West Lafayette  Indiana City Council passed an ordinance banning facial recognition surveillance technology              
On October              human rights groups called upon the University of Miami to ban facial recognition technology  This came after the students accused the school of using the software to identify student protesters  The allegations were  however  denied by the university              
A state police reform law in Massachusetts will take effect in July       a ban passed by the legislature was rejected by governor Charlie Baker               Instead  the law requires a judicial warrant  limit the personnel who can perform the search  record data about how the technology is used  and create a commission to make recommendations about future regulations              
Reports in      revealed that some police departments  including San Francisco Police Department  had skirted bans on facial recognition technology that had been enacted in their respective cities              

European Union edit 
In January       the European Union suggested  but then quickly scrapped  a proposed moratorium on facial recognition in public spaces                           
The European  Reclaim Your Face  coalition launched in October       The coalition calls for a ban on facial recognition and launched a European Citizens  Initiative in February       More than    organizations call on the European Commission to strictly regulate the use of biometric surveillance technologies              

Emotion recognition edit 
In the   th and   th century  the belief that facial expressions revealed the moral worth or true inner state of a human was widespread and physiognomy was a respected science in the Western world  From the early   th century onwards photography was used in the physiognomic analysis of facial features and facial expression to detect insanity and dementia               In the     s and     s the study of human emotions and its expressions was reinvented by psychologists  who tried to define a normal range of emotional responses to events               The research on automated emotion recognition has since the     s focused on facial expressions and speech  which are regarded as the two most important ways in which humans communicate emotions to other humans  In the     s the Facial Action Coding System  FACS  categorization for the physical expression of emotions was established               Its developer Paul Ekman maintains that there are six emotions that are universal to all human beings and that these can be coded in facial expressions               Research into automatic emotion specific expression recognition has in the past decades focused on frontal view images of human faces               Facial thermography can be considered as a promising tool of emotion recognition                           
In       facial feature emotion recognition algorithms were among the new technologies  alongside high definition CCTV  high resolution  D face recognition and iris recognition  that found their way out of university research labs      citation needed      In       Facebook acquired FacioMetrics  a facial feature emotion recognition corporate spin off by Carnegie Mellon University  In the same year Apple Inc  acquired the facial feature emotion recognition start up Emotient               By the end of       commercial vendors of facial recognition systems offered to integrate and deploy emotion recognition algorithms for facial features      citation needed      The MIT s Media Lab spin off Affectiva              by late      offered a facial expression emotion detection product that can recognize emotions in humans while driving              

Anti facial recognition systems edit 
The development of anti facial recognition technology is effectively an arms race between privacy researchers and big data companies  Big data companies increasingly use convolutional AI technology to create ever more advanced facial recognition models  Solutions to block facial recognition may not work on newer software  or on different types of facial recognition models  One popular cited example of facial recognition blocking is the CVDazzle makeup and haircut system  but the creators note on their website that it has been outdated for quite some time as it was designed to combat a particular facial recognition algorithm and may not work               Another example is the emergence of facial recognition that can identify people wearing facemasks and sunglasses  especially after the COVID    pandemic              
Given that big data companies have much more funding than privacy researchers  it is very difficult for anti facial recognition systems to keep up  There is also no guarantee that obfuscation techniques that were used for images taken in the past and stored  such as masks or software obfuscation  would protect users from facial recognition analysis of those images by future technology              
In January       Japanese researchers from the National Institute of Informatics created  privacy visor  glasses that use nearly infrared light to make the face underneath it unrecognizable to face recognition software that use infrared               The latest version uses a titanium frame  light reflective material and a mask which uses angles and patterns to disrupt facial recognition technology through both absorbing and bouncing back light sources                                                      However  these methods are used to prevent infrared facial recognition and would not work on AI facial recognition of plain images  Some projects use adversarial machine learning to come up with new printed patterns that confuse existing face recognition software              
One method that may work to protect from facial recognition systems are specific haircuts and make up patterns that prevent the used algorithms to detect a face  known as computer vision dazzle               Incidentally  the makeup styles popular with Juggalos may also protect against facial recognition              
Facial masks that are worn to protect from contagious viruses can reduce the accuracy of facial recognition systems  A      NIST study  tested popular one to one matching systems and found a failure rate between five and fifty percent on masked individuals  The Verge speculated that the accuracy rate of mass surveillance systems  which were not included in the study  would be even less accurate than the accuracy of one to one matching systems               The facial recognition of Apple Pay can work through many barriers  including heavy makeup  thick beards and even sunglasses  but fails with masks               However  facial recognition of masked faces is increasingly getting more reliable 
Another solution is the application of obfuscation to images that may fool facial recognition systems while still appearing normal to a human user  These could be used for when images are posted online or on social media  However  as it is hard to remove images once they are on the internet  the obfuscation on these images may be defeated and the face of the user identified by future advances in technology  Two examples of this technique  developed in       are the ANU s  Camera Adversaria  camera app  and the University of Chicago s Fawkes image cloaking software algorithm which applies obfuscation to already taken photos               However  by      the Fawkes obfuscation algorithm had already been specifically targeted by Microsoft Azure which changed its algorithm to lower Fawkes  effectiveness
