							From her earliest appearances on screen  Wafaa Amer understood that acting isn t merely a craft it s a message  a responsibility  and a bridge connecting her to an audience that has believed in her for years  This Ramadan  she wasn t just another name in the credits she was a force across various productions  from lead roles to captivating cameos  traversing genres from social drama to historical epics 
In this candid interview  Amer opens up about the challenges behind the scenes  the joy of audience reactions  and what s next in her career  Here s what she had to say 
  How do you view the audience s response to your work this Ramadan 
I m genuinely happy with the audience s feedback this year  I received so many warm messages and heartfelt comments on social media and in person  I truly felt that each character I played left a mark  That matters more to me than the number of scenes or how long I was on screen  A real actor is measured by their impact  not just their presence 
  You were involved in several productions this season  How was that experience 
I naturally enjoy challenges  For me  taking part in multiple projects during the same season isn t stressful it s invigorating  especially when the roles are distinct  The broadcast schedule is up to the production companies  but I choose my roles carefully to ensure diversity  I never want the audience to feel like I m repeating myself 
  Was it difficult to switch between different characters and roles 
Not at all  Acting  to me  is about focus and full immersion  I leave one character behind completely before stepping into the next  Even if I ve played Upper Egyptian or popular characters before  I always aim to present something new  Everything changes the mindset  the look  the energy  That transformation is part of what makes this profession so rewarding

  Tell us about your role in  Gawdar         Alf Leyla w Leyla 
Gawdar is unlike anything else it s inspired by        One Thousand and One Nights         but with a bold  modern twist  The production was top notch  with a beautifully written script by Anwar Abdel Maguid and masterful direction from Islam Khairy  I m proud of every scene because the work reflects true collaboration and artistic integrity 
  Could you elaborate on your role in the Bahraini series Aaber Sabeel 
This project means a lot to me  It was a pan Arab production  bringing together talents from the Gulf and across the Arab world which is something our regional drama truly needs  I worked with amazing stars like Abdul Mohsen Al Nimr  Abdullah Shaheeri  Leila Abdullah  and Mona Hussein  Every moment on set was enjoyable  and I walked away with great memories and even greater pride 
   Banat Hammam  raises a bold hypothesis about        Raya and Skeenah         How did you approach that 
The series presents an intellectual adventure  asking a powerful question  Were Raya and Skeenah inherently criminal  or were they shaped by their circumstances  We try to explore this through art  The script was smart and layered  and the performances were heartfelt  What I truly appreciated was how the audience engaged with the question even if they didn t agree with it  That kind of reaction is a success in itself 

  You appeared as a guest star in        Ish Ish         How would you describe that experience 
I was genuinely happy to take part  Although the role was brief  it was light  unique  and full of charm  The entire production carried a joyful comedic spirit  and I wanted to be part of that energy  In the end  a guest appearance isn t about screen time it s about the impression you leave 
  How do you view the contrast between working in comedy  drama  and historical genres in the same season 
I thrive on switching between genres  I believe a true artist should be versatile  I love comedy just as much as I love tragedy  Success in one genre motivates me to try another it allows me to keep evolving and rediscovering myself 
  Do you feel a responsibility to support the younger generation of artists 
Absolutely  We must always support emerging talent those who are still dreaming  When I collaborate with young artists  I feel like I m paying it forward  just as others once supported me  It s a duty we carry as actors and as part of the artistic community 
  What guides your choice of roles 
I choose with my heart but also with care  I thoroughly read the script  consider the team behind it  and think about the working environment  I need a space that feels humane and supportive so I can create freely  The director  in particular  is a crucial partner for me they help bring out the best version of any performance 
  How do you handle criticism 
Thankfully  I haven t faced much harsh criticism  maybe because I stay close to people and avoid doing things that upset them  Still  when I do receive criticism  I listen to it  I always try to understand the intention behind it  Growth is essential any actor who doesn t evolve eventually fades 

  There were rumors of a conflict between you and director Mohamed Sami  What s the truth 
There s absolutely no conflict  On the contrary  Mohamed Sami is a talented director and a respectful person  I care for him and his family deeply  Everything that was said about a dispute is baseless rumor 
  Why did you decline the guest role in Fahd El Batal 
It wasn t a rejection in the traditional sense  I was actually very excited about the opportunity I truly admire Ahmed Al Awadi  both as an artist and a person  We ve worked together before and have great chemistry  Unfortunately  scheduling conflicts got in the way  but I wished them all the best with love and sincerity 
  What would you like to say to your audience after this Ramadan season 
To my wonderful audience  You are the secret behind every success I ve had  Your love is my greatest joy  Because of you  I continue  and I grow  Thank you for every kind word  every message  every ounce of support  I promise to always work hard and strive to exceed your expectations 
  What are the criteria you now use when selecting roles 
At this stage  I look for roles that challenge me and offer real value to the audience  I don t accept scripts just for the sake of being in something  I need to feel connected to the character and to believe in the message  I m always searching for parts that push my boundaries and allow people to see me in a new light 
  Do you prefer popular characters or aristocratic ones 
Honestly  I love both  Every character has its own flavor  Popular roles are rich in authenticity and strength  while aristocratic ones demand poise and subtlety  What matters most to me is that the character is well written and has depth 
  How do you see the current landscape of Egyptian drama 
We have immense talent and strong productions  but we still need more structure particularly when it comes to script development  With solid scripts and respectable production values  we can absolutely compete on an international level  And the evidence is clear our series are already reaching viewers across the globe 
  Is there a director you d love to work with again 
There are many directors I admire  but someone like Mohamed Fadel  who had a profound impact on my early career  is definitely at the top of my list  I d also love to continue working with younger directors they bring fresh energy and new perspectives that inspire me 
  What s your take on categorizing actresses into certain roles 
I m completely against it  A real artist should be able to do anything  You can t confine someone to one type of role  I ve played everything from the popular woman  to historical characters  to mothers  to aristocratic figures and every time  I try to bring something new  Categorization limits creativity  and I believe we re meant to keep breaking those limits
