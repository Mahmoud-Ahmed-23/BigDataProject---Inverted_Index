Bletchley Park is an English country house and estate in Bletchley  Milton Keynes  Buckinghamshire   that became the principal centre of Allied code breaking during the Second World War  During World War II  the estate housed the Government Code and Cypher School  GC amp CS   which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the Axis Powers                   most importantly the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers  The GC amp CS team of codebreakers included John Tiltman  Dilwyn Knox  Alan Turing  Harry Golombek  Gordon Welchman  Hugh Alexander  Donald Michie  Bill Tutte and Stuart Milner Barry 
According to the official historian of British Intelligence  the  Ultra  intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years  and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain             The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption  culminating in the development of Colossus  the world s first programmable digital electronic computer      a      Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in      and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid     s  After the war it had various uses and now houses the Bletchley Park Museum 


History edit 
Pre War edit 
The site appears in the Domesday Book of      as part of the Manor of Eaton  Browne Willis built a mansion there in       but after Thomas Harrison purchased the property in      this was pulled down  It was first known as Bletchley Park after its purchase by the architect Samuel Lipscomb Seckham in                  who built a house there             The estate of     acres           ha  was bought in      by Sir Herbert Samuel Leon  who expanded the then existing house            into what architect Landis Gores called a  maudlin and monstrous pile                        combining Victorian Gothic  Tudor  and Dutch Baroque styles             At his Christmas family gatherings there was a fox hunting meet on Boxing Day with glasses of sloe gin from the butler  and the house was always  humming with servants   With    gardeners  a flower bed of yellow daffodils could become a sea of red tulips overnight             After the death of Herbert Leon in       the estate continued to be occupied by his widow Fanny Leon  n e Higham  until her death in                 

Preparation for War edit 
Bletchley s Polish Memorial  commemorating  the  prewar  work of Marian Rejewski  Jerzy R  ycki and Henryk Zygalski  mathematicians of the Polish intelligence service  in first breaking the Enigma code  Their work greatly assisted the Bletchley Park code breakers and contributed to the Allied victory in World War      II  
In       the mansion and much of the site was bought by a builder for a housing estate  but in May      Admiral Sir Hugh Sinclair  head of the Secret Intelligence Service  SIS or MI    bought the mansion and    acres          ha  of land for                  today  for use by GC amp CS and SIS in the event of war  He used his own money as the Government said they did not have the budget to do so             
A key advantage seen by Sinclair and his colleagues  inspecting the site under the cover of  Captain Ridley s shooting party               was Bletchley s geographical centrality  It was almost immediately adjacent to Bletchley railway station  where the  Varsity Line  between Oxford and Cambridge                  whose universities were expected to supply many of the code breakers                  met the main West Coast railway line connecting London  Birmingham  Manchester  Liverpool  Glasgow and Edinburgh  Watling Street  the main road linking London to the north west  subsequently the A   was close by  and high volume communication links were available at the telegraph and telephone repeater station in nearby Fenny Stratford             
Five weeks before the outbreak of war  Warsaw s Cipher Bureau revealed its achievements in breaking Enigma to astonished French and British personnel              The British used the Poles  information and techniques  and the Enigma clone sent to them in August       which greatly increased their  previously very limited  success in decrypting Enigma messages             

Early work edit 
 Flow of information from an intercepted Enigma message            
The first personnel of the Government Code and Cypher School  GC amp CS  moved to Bletchley Park on    August       The Naval  Military  and Air Sections were on the ground floor of the mansion  together with a telephone exchange  teleprinter room  kitchen  and dining room  the top floor was allocated to MI   Construction of the wooden huts began in late       and Elmers School  a neighbouring boys  boarding school in a Victorian Gothic redbrick building by a church  was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections             
The only direct enemy damage to the site was done       November      by three bombs probably intended for Bletchley railway station  Hut         shifted two feet off its foundation  was winched back into place as work inside continued             

Action This Day edit 
Main article  Action This Day  memo 
During a morale boosting visit on   September       Winston Churchill reportedly remarked to Denniston or Menzies   I told you to leave no stone unturned to get staff  but I had no idea you had taken me so literally               Six weeks later  having failed to get sufficient typing and unskilled staff to achieve the productivity that was possible  Turing  Welchman  Alexander and Milner Barry wrote directly to Churchill  His response was  Action this day make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done              

Allied Involvement edit 
After the United States joined World War II  a number of American cryptographers were posted to Hut    and from May      onwards there was close co operation between British and American intelligence             leading to the      BRUSA Agreement which was the forerunner of the Five Eyes partnership  
In contrast  the Soviet Union was never officially told of Bletchley Park and its activities  a reflection of Churchill s distrust of the Soviets even during the US UK USSR alliance imposed by the Nazi threat              However Bletchley Park was infiltrated by the Soviet mole John Cairncross  a member of the Cambridge Spy Ring  who leaked Ultra material to Moscow

Admiral Hugh Sinclair was the founder and head of GC amp CS between      and      with Commander Alastair Denniston being operational head of the organization from      to       beginning with its formation from the Admiralty s Room     NID    and the War Office s MI b              Key GC amp CS cryptanalysts who moved from London to Bletchley Park included John Tiltman  Dillwyn  Dilly  Knox  Josh Cooper  Oliver Strachey and Nigel de Grey  These people had a variety of backgrounds                  linguists and chess champions were common  and Knox s field was papyrology  The British War Office recruited top solvers of cryptic crossword puzzles  as these individuals had strong lateral thinking skills             
On the day Britain declared war on Germany  Denniston wrote to the Foreign Office about recruiting  men of the professor type               Personal networking drove early recruitments  particularly of men from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford  Trustworthy women were similarly recruited for administrative and clerical jobs              In one      recruiting stratagem  The Daily Telegraph was asked to organise a crossword competition  after which promising contestants were discreetly approached about  a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort              
Denniston recognised  however  that the enemy s use of electromechanical cipher machines meant that formally trained mathematicians would also be needed              Oxford s Peter Twinn joined GC amp CS in February                   Cambridge s Alan Turing             and Gordon Welchman             began training in      and reported to Bletchley the day after war was declared  along with John Jeffreys  Later recruited cryptanalysts included the mathematicians Derek Taunt              Jack Good  Bill Tutte              and Max Newman  historian Harry Hinsley  and chess champions Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner Barry              Joan Clarke was one of the few women employed at Bletchley as a full fledged cryptanalyst                         
When seeking to recruit more suitably advanced linguists  John Tiltman turned to Patrick Wilkinson of the Italian section for advice  and he suggested asking Lord Lindsay of Birker  of Balliol College  Oxford  S  W  Grose  and Martin Charlesworth  of St John s College  Cambridge  to recommend classical scholars or applicants to their colleges             
This eclectic staff of  Boffins and Debs   scientists and debutantes  young women of high society              caused GC amp CS to be whimsically dubbed the  Golf  Cheese and Chess Society               Among those who worked there and later became famous in other fields were historian Asa Briggs  politician Roy Jenkins and novelist Angus Wilson             
After initial training at the Inter Service Special Intelligence School set up by John Tiltman  initially at an RAF depot in Buckingham and later in Bedford                  where it was known locally as  the Spy School               staff worked a six day week  rotating through three shifts         p m  to midnight  midnight to        a m   the most disliked shift   and        a m  to        p m   each with a half hour meal break  At the end of the third week  a worker went off at        a m  and came back at        p m   thus putting in    hours on that last day  The irregular hours affected workers  health and social life  as well as the routines of the nearby homes at which most staff lodged  The work was tedious and demanded intense concentration  staff got one week s leave four times a year  but some  girls  collapsed and required extended rest              Recruitment took place to combat a shortage of experts in Morse code and German             
In January       at the peak of codebreaking efforts  nearly        personnel were working at Bletchley and its outstations              About three quarters of these were women              Many of the women came from middle class backgrounds and held degrees in the areas of mathematics  physics and engineering  they were given the chance due to the lack of men  who had been sent to war  They performed calculations and coding and hence were integral to the computing processes              Among them were Eleanor Ireland  who worked on the Colossus computers             and Ruth Briggs  a German scholar  who worked within the Naval Section                         
The female staff in Dilwyn Knox s section were sometimes termed  Dilly s Fillies               Knox s methods enabled Mavis Lever  who married mathematician and fellow code breaker Keith Batey  and Margaret Rock to solve a German code  the Abwehr cipher                         
Many of the women had backgrounds in languages  particularly French  German and Italian  Among them were Rozanne Colchester  a translator who worked mainly for the Italian air forces Section              and Cicely Mayhew  recruited straight from university  who worked in Hut    translating decoded German Navy signals              as did Jane Fawcett  n e Hughes  who decrypted a vital message concerning the German battleship Bismarck and after the war became an opera singer and buildings conservationist             
Alan Brooke  CIGS  in his secret wartime diary frequently refers to  intercepts              

   April       Took lunch in car and went to see the organization for breaking down ciphers  Bletchley Park    a wonderful set of professors and genii  I marvel at the work they succeed in doing 
   June       After lunch  with Andrew Cunningham  RN  and Sinclair  RAF  we went to  The Park    I began by addressing some     of the workers who consist of all   services  both sexes  and civilians  They come from every sort of walk of life  professors  students  actors  dancers  mathematicians  electricians signallers  etc  I thanked them on behalf of the Chiefs of Staff  and congratulated them on the results of their work  We then toured round the establishment and had tea before returning 
Secrecy edit 
Properly used  the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers should have been virtually unbreakable  but flaws in German cryptographic procedures  and poor discipline among the personnel carrying them out  created vulnerabilities that made Bletchley s attacks just barely feasible  These vulnerabilities  however  could have been remedied by relatively simple improvements in enemy procedures              and such changes would certainly have been implemented had Germany had any hint of Bletchley s success  Thus the intelligence Bletchley produced was considered wartime Britain s  Ultra secret                   higher even than the normally highest classification Most      Secret                         and security was paramount             
All staff signed the Official Secrets Act        and a      security warning emphasised the importance of discretion even within Bletchley itself   Do not talk at meals  Do not talk in the transport  Do not talk travelling  Do not talk in the billet  Do not talk by your own fireside  Be careful even in your Hut                      
Nevertheless  there were security leaks  Jock Colville  the Assistant Private Secretary to Winston Churchill  recorded in his diary on    July       that the newspaper proprietor Lord Camrose had discovered Ultra and that security leaks  increase in number and seriousness               
Despite the high degree of secrecy surrounding Bletchley Park during the Second World War  unique and hitherto unknown amateur film footage of the outstation at nearby Whaddon Hall  came to light in       after being anonymously donated to the Bletchley Park Trust                          A spokesman for the Trust noted the film s existence was all the more incredible because it was  very  very rare even to have      still      photographs  of the park and its associated sites             
Bletchley Park was known as  B P   to those who worked there             
 Station X   X   Roman numeral ten    London Signals Intelligence Centre   and  Government Communications Headquarters  were all cover names used during the war             
The formal posting of the many  Wrens                   members of the Women s Royal Naval Service                  working there  was to HMS Pembroke V  Royal Air Force names of Bletchley Park and its outstations included RAF Eastcote  RAF Lime Grove and RAF Church Green              The postal address that staff had to use was  Room     Foreign Office              

Intelligence reporting edit 
 Number of signals despatched daily from Bletchley Park Hut   during the Second World War            
Initially  when only a very limited amount of Enigma traffic was being read              deciphered non Naval Enigma messages were sent from Hut        to Hut   which handled their translation and onward transmission  Subsequently  under Group Captain Eric Jones  Hut   expanded to become the heart of Bletchley Park s intelligence effort  with input from decrypts of  Tunny   Lorenz SZ    traffic and many other sources   Early in      it moved into Block D  but its functions were still referred to as Hut               
Hut   contained a number of sections  Air Section   A   Military Section   M   a small Naval Section   N   a multi service Research Section   G  and a large liaison section   L               It also housed the Traffic Analysis Section  SIXTA              An important function that allowed the synthesis of raw messages into valuable Military intelligence was the indexing and cross referencing of information in a number of different filing systems              Intelligence reports were sent out to the Secret Intelligence Service  the intelligence chiefs in the relevant ministries  and later on to high level commanders in the field             
Naval Enigma deciphering was in Hut         with translation in Hut         Verbatim translations were sent to the Naval Intelligence Division  NID  of the Admiralty s Operational Intelligence Centre  OIC   supplemented by information from indexes as to the meaning of technical terms and cross references from a knowledge store of German naval technology              Where relevant to non naval matters  they would also be passed to Hut    Hut   also decoded a manual system known as the dockyard cipher  which sometimes carried messages that were also sent on an Enigma network  Feeding these back to Hut        provided excellent  cribs  for Known plaintext attacks on the daily naval Enigma key             

Listening stations edit 
Initially  a wireless room was established at Bletchley Park 
It was set up in the mansion s water tower under the code name  Station      X               a term now sometimes applied to the codebreaking efforts at Bletchley as a whole  The  X  is the Roman numeral  ten   this being the Secret Intelligence Service s tenth such station  Due to the long radio aerials stretching from the wireless room  the radio station was moved from Bletchley Park to nearby Whaddon Hall to avoid drawing attention to the site                         
Subsequently  other listening stations                  the Y stations  such as the ones at Chicksands in Bedfordshire  Beaumanor Hall  Leicestershire  where the headquarters of the War Office  Y  Group was located  and Beeston Hill Y Station in Norfolk                  gathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley  Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle despatch riders or  later  by teleprinter             

Additional buildings edit 
The wartime needs required the building of additional accommodation             

Huts edit 
Hut  
Hut    adjacent to the mansion  is now a bar and restaurant for the museum 
Hut   in     
Often a hut s number became so strongly associated with the work performed inside that even when the work was moved to another building it was still referred to by the original  Hut  designation                         

Hut    The first hut  built in                  used to house the Wireless Station for a short time              later administrative functions such as transport  typing  and Bombe maintenance  The first Bombe   Victory   was initially housed here

Blocks edit 
In addition to the wooden huts  there were a number of brick built  blocks  

Block A  Naval Intelligence 
Block B  Italian Air and Naval  and Japanese code breaking 
Block C  Stored the substantial punch card indexes 
Block D  From February      it housed those from Hut    who synthesised intelligence from multiple sources  Huts   and   and SIXTA             
Block E  Incoming and outgoing Radio Transmission and TypeX 
Block F  Included the Newmanry and Testery  and Japanese Military Air Section  It has since been demolished

Block H  Tunny and Colossus  now The National Museum of Computing  
Work on specific countries  signals edit 
German signals edit 
Most German messages decrypted at Bletchley were produced by one or another version of the Enigma cipher machine  but an important minority were produced by the even more complicated twelve rotor Lorenz SZ   on line teleprinter cipher machine used for high command messages  known as Fish             

The working rebuilt bombe  built by a team led by John Harper             and switched on by the Duke of Kent  patron of the British Computer Society  on    July       This is now located at The National Museum of Computing in Block H on Bletchley Park 
The bombe was an electromechanical device whose function was to discover some of the daily settings of the Enigma machines on the various German military networks                                      Its pioneering design was developed by Alan Turing  with an important contribution from Gordon Welchman  and the machine was engineered by Harold  Doc  Keen of the British Tabulating Machine Company  Each machine was about   feet           m  high and wide    feet            m  deep and weighed about a ton             
At its peak  GC amp CS was reading approximately       messages per day               As a hedge against enemy attack              most bombes were dispersed to installations at Adstock and Wavendon  both later supplanted by installations at Stanmore and Eastcote   and Gayhurst                           
Luftwaffe messages were the first to be read in quantity  The German navy had much tighter procedures  and the capture of code books was needed before they could be broken  When  in February       the German navy introduced the four rotor Enigma for communications with its Atlantic U boats  this traffic became unreadable for a period of ten months               Britain produced modified bombes  but it was the success of the US Navy Bombe that was the main source of reading messages from this version of Enigma for the rest of the war  Messages were sent to and fro across the Atlantic by enciphered teleprinter links             

A Mark   Colossus computer  The ten Colossi were the world s first  semi   programmable electronic computers  the first having been built in     
The Lorenz messages were codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park  They were only sent in quantity from mid       The Tunny networks were used for high level messages between German High Command and field commanders  With the help of German operator errors  the cryptanalysts in the Testery  named after Ralph Tester  its head  worked out the logical structure of the machine despite not knowing its physical form  They devised automatic machinery to help with decryption  which culminated in Colossus  the world s first programmable digital electronic computer  This was designed and built by Tommy Flowers and his team at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill  The prototype first worked in December       was delivered to Bletchley Park in January and first worked operationally on   February       Enhancements were developed for the Mark   Colossus  the first of which was working at Bletchley Park on the morning of   June in time for D day  Flowers then produced one Colossus a month for the rest of the war  making a total of ten with an eleventh part built  The machines were operated mainly by Wrens in a section named the Newmanry after its head Max Newman              
Bletchley s work was essential to defeating the U boats in the Battle of the Atlantic  and to the British naval victories in the Battle of Cape Matapan and the Battle of North Cape  In       Ultra exerted a powerful effect on the North African desert campaign against German forces under General Erwin Rommel  General Sir Claude Auchinleck wrote that were it not for Ultra   Rommel would have certainly got through to Cairo   While not changing the events   Ultra  decrypts featured prominently in the story of Operation SALAM  L szl  Alm sy s mission across the desert behind Allied lines in                    Prior to the Normandy landings on D Day in June       the Allies knew the locations of all but two of Germany s fifty eight Western front divisions              


Italian signals edit 
See also  Cryptanalysis of the Enigma
Italian signals had been of interest since Italy s attack on Abyssinia in      
During the Spanish Civil War the Italian Navy used the K model of the commercial Enigma without a plugboard  this was solved by Knox in      
When Italy entered the war in      an improved version of the machine was used  though little traffic was sent by it and there were  wholesale changes  in Italian codes and cyphers              
Knox was given a new section for work on Enigma variations  which he staffed with women   Dilly s girls    who included Margaret Rock  Jean Perrin  Clare Harding  Rachel Ronald  Elisabeth Granger  and Mavis Lever              
Mavis Lever solved the signals revealing the Italian Navy s operational plans before the Battle of Cape Matapan in       leading to a British victory              
Although most Bletchley staff did not know the results of their work  Admiral Cunningham visited Bletchley in person a few weeks later to congratulate them              
On entering World War II in June       the Italians were using book codes for most of their military messages  The exception was the Italian Navy  which after the Battle of Cape Matapan started using the C    version of the Boris Hagelin rotor based cipher machine  particularly to route their navy and merchant marine convoys to the conflict in North Africa             As a consequence  JRM Butler recruited his former student Bernard Willson to join a team with two others in Hut                                  In June       Willson became the first of the team to decode the Hagelin system  thus enabling military commanders to direct the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force to sink enemy ships carrying supplies from Europe to Rommel s Afrika Korps  This led to increased shipping losses and  from reading the intercepted traffic  the team learnt that between May and September      the stock of fuel for the Luftwaffe in North Africa reduced by    per cent              
After an intensive language course  in March      Willson switched to Japanese language based codes              
A Middle East Intelligence Centre  MEIC  was set up in Cairo in       When Italy entered the war in June       delays in forwarding intercepts to Bletchley via congested radio links resulted in cryptanalysts being sent to Cairo  A Combined Bureau Middle East  CBME  was set up in November  though the Middle East authorities made  increasingly bitter complaints  that GC amp CS was giving too little priority to work on Italian cyphers  However  the principle of concentrating high grade cryptanalysis at Bletchley was maintained               John Chadwick started cryptanalysis work in      on Italian signals at the naval base  HMS Nile  in Alexandria  Later  he was with GC amp CS  in the Heliopolis Museum  Cairo and then in the Villa Laurens  Alexandria              

Soviet signals edit 
Soviet signals had been studied since the     s  In          John Tiltman  who had worked on Russian Army traffic from       set up two Russian sections at Wavendon  a country house near Bletchley  and at Sarafand in Palestine  Two Russian high grade army and navy systems were broken early in       Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland  where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment  In June       when the Soviet Union became an ally  Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it  In December       the Russian section was closed down  but in late summer      or late       a small GC amp CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane  then in Sloane Square              

Japanese signals edit 
An outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in       the Far East Combined Bureau  FECB   The FECB naval staff moved in      to Singapore  then Colombo  Ceylon  then Kilindini  Mombasa  Kenya  They succeeded in deciphering Japanese codes with a mixture of skill and good fortune               The Army and Air Force staff went from Singapore to the Wireless Experimental Centre at Delhi  India              
In early       a six month crash course in Japanese  for    undergraduates from Oxford and Cambridge  was started by the Inter Services Special Intelligence School in Bedford  in a building across from the main Post Office  This course was repeated every six months until war s end  Most of those completing these courses worked on decoding Japanese naval messages in Hut         under John Tiltman              
By mid       well over     personnel were involved with this operation  which co operated closely with the FECB and the US Signal intelligence Service at Arlington Hall  Virginia  In       Michael Smith wrote that   Only now are the British codebreakers  like John Tiltman  Hugh Foss  and Eric Nave  beginning to receive the recognition they deserve for breaking Japanese codes and cyphers               

Postwar edit 
Continued secrecy edit 
After the War  the secrecy imposed on Bletchley staff remained in force  so that most relatives never knew more than that a child  spouse  or parent had done some kind of secret war work               Churchill referred to the Bletchley staff as  the geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled                That said  occasional mentions of the work performed at Bletchley Park slipped the censor s net and appeared in print              
With the publication of F       W  Winterbotham s The Ultra Secret                         b      public discussion of Bletchley Park s work finally became possible  although some former staff considered themselves bound to silence forever              
Professor Brian Randell was researching the history of computer science in Britain in         for a conference on the history of computing held at the Los Alamos National Laboratory  New Mexico on       June       and received permission to present a paper on wartime development of the Colossi at the Post Office Research Station  Dollis Hill   In October      the British Government had released a series of captioned photographs from the Public Record Office   The interest in the  revelations  in his paper resulted in a special evening meeting when Randell and Coombs answered further questions  Coombs later wrote that  no member of our team could ever forget the fellowship  the sense of purpose and  above all  the breathless excitement of those days   In      Randell published an article  The First Electronic Computer  in several journals      c                  

For a long time  the British Government failed to acknowledge the contributions the personnel at Bletchley Park had made  Their work achieved official recognition only in                   and in July      the British government announced that Bletchley personnel would be recognised with a commemorative badge              

Site edit 
After the war  the site passed through a succession of hands and saw a number of uses  including as a teacher training college and local GPO headquarters  By       the site was nearly empty and the buildings were at risk of demolition for redevelopment              
In February       the Milton Keynes Borough Council declared most of the Park a conservation area  and the Bletchley Park Trust was formed to maintain the site as a museum  The site opened to visitors in       and was formally inaugurated by the Duke of Kent as Chief Patron in July       In      the land owners  the Property Advisors to the Civil Estate and BT  granted a lease to the Trust giving it control over most of the site              
In      the site was at risk of being sold for housing development  However  Milton Keynes Council made it into a conservation area  Bletchley Park Trust was set up in      by a group of people who recognised the site s importance               The initial trustees included Roger Bristow  Ted Enever  Peter Wescombe  Dr Peter Jarvis of the Bletchley Archaeological  amp  Historical Society  and Tony Sale who in      became the first director of the Bletchley Park Museums              

Institutional Continuity edit 
After the war  the Government Code  amp  Cypher School became the Government Communications Headquarters  GCHQ   moving to Eastcote in      and to Cheltenham in the     s               The site was used by various government agencies  including the GPO and the Civil Aviation Authority  One large building  block F  was demolished in      by which time the site was being run down with tenants leaving              

Heritage attraction edit 
The stableyard cottages  where Alan Turing worked
June      saw the completion of an    million restoration project by museum design specialist  Event Communications  which was marked by a visit from Catherine  Duchess of Cambridge               The Duchess  paternal grandmother  Valerie  and Valerie s twin sister  Mary  n e Glassborow   both worked at Bletchley Park during the war  The twin sisters worked as Foreign Office Civilians in Hut    where they managed the interception of enemy and neutral diplomatic signals for decryption  Valerie married Catherine s grandfather  Captain Peter Middleton                                         A memorial at Bletchley Park commemorates Mary and Valerie Middleton s work as code breakers

Funding edit 
In October       American billionaire Sidney Frank donated          to Bletchley Park Trust to fund a new Science Centre dedicated to Alan Turing               Simon Greenish joined as Director in      to lead the fund raising effort              in a post he held until      when Iain Standen took over the leadership role               In July       a letter to The Times from more than a hundred academics condemned the neglect of the site                            In September       PGP  IBM and other technology firms announced a fund raising campaign to repair the facility               On   November      it was announced that English Heritage would donate          to help maintain the buildings at Bletchley Park  and that they were in discussions regarding the donation of a further                       
In October       the Bletchley Park Trust received a      million Heritage Lottery Fund grant to be used  to complete the restoration of the site  and to tell its story to the highest modern standards  on the condition that      million of match funding is raised by the Bletchley Park Trust                            Just weeks later  Google contributed                       and by June      the trust had successfully raised      million to unlock the grants to restore Huts   and    as well as develop its exhibition centre in Block C              
Additional income is raised by renting Block H to the National Museum of Computing  and some office space in various parts of the park to private firms                                        
Due to the COVID    pandemic the Trust expected to lose more than    million in      and be required to cut a third of its workforce  Former MP John Leech asked Amazon  Apple  Google  Facebook and Microsoft to donate          each to secure the future of the Trust  Leech had led the successful campaign to pardon Alan Turing and implement Turing s Law

  Colossus itself was designed and built by Tommy Flowers at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill in north London  to solve a problem posed by mathematician Max Newman at the GC amp CS  From there  it  and nine more  were installed and operated in Bletchley 

   He had permission to publish  but no access to official records  so had to rely on memory
