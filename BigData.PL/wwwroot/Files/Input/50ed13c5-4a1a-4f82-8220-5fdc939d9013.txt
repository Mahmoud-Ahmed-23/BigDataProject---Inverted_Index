The Fukushima nuclear accident was a major nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in  kuma  Fukushima  Japan  which began on    March       The cause of the accident was the      T hoku earthquake and tsunami  which resulted in electrical grid failure and damaged nearly all of the power plant s backup energy sources  The subsequent inability to sufficiently cool reactors after shutdown compromised containment and resulted in the release of radioactive contaminants into the surrounding environment                                     The accident was rated seven  the maximum severity  on the International Nuclear Event Scale by Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency  following a report by the JNES  Japan Nuclear Energy Safety Organization                          It is regarded as the worst nuclear incident since the Chernobyl disaster in                   which was also rated a seven on the International Nuclear Event Scale             
According to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation   no adverse health effects among Fukushima residents have been documented that are directly attributable to radiation exposure from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant accident                                                 Insurance compensation was paid for one death from lung cancer  but this does not prove a causal relationship between radiation and the cancer                        Six other persons have been reported as having developed cancer or leukemia             Two workers were hospitalized because of radiation burns             and several other people sustained physical injuries as a consequence of the accident            
Criticisms have been made about the public perception of radiological hazards resulting from accidents and the implementation of evacuations  similar to the Chernobyl nuclear accident   as they were accused of causing more harm than they prevented              Following the accident  at least         residents of the surrounding area were permanently or temporarily displaced  either voluntarily or by evacuation order                                                The displacements resulted in at least    deaths as well as stress and fear of radiological hazards                                                 
Investigations faulted lapses in safety and oversight  namely failures in risk assessment and evacuation planning                                               Controversy surrounds the disposal of treated wastewater once used to cool the reactor  resulting in numerous protests in neighboring countries                                     

The expense of cleaning up the radioactive contamination and compensation for the victims of the Fukushima nuclear accident was estimated by Japan s trade ministry in November      to be    trillion yen  equivalent to     billion US dollars

The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant consisted of six General Electric  GE  light water boiling water reactors  BWRs                                   Unit   was a GE type   BWR  Units     were type    Unit   was a type               
At the time of the T hoku earthquake on    March       units     were operating  However  the spent fuel pools of all units still required cooling                                                

Materials edit 
Many of the internal components and fuel assembly cladding are made from a zirconium alloy  Zircaloy  for its low neutron cross section  At normal operating temperatures             C            F    it is inert  However  above             C              F   Zircaloy can be oxidized by steam to form hydrogen gas             or by uranium dioxide to form uranium metal                          Both of these reactions are exothermic  In combination with the exothermic reaction of boron carbide with stainless steel  these reactions can contribute to the overheating of a reactor                                 

Isolated cooling systems edit 
See also  Decay heat        Power reactors in shutdown  and Nuclear reactor safety system
In the event of an emergency  reactor pressure vessels  RPV  are automatically isolated from the turbines and main condenser and are instead switched to a secondary condenser system which is designed to cool the reactor without the need for pumps powered by external power or generators  The isolation condenser  IC  system involved a closed coolant loop from the pressure vessel with a heat exchanger in a dedicated condenser tank  Steam would be forced into the heat exchanger by the reactor pressure  and the condensed coolant would be fed back into the vessel by gravity  Each reactor was initially designed to be equipped with two redundant ICs which were each capable of cooling the reactor for at least   hours  at which point  the condenser tank would have to be refilled   However  it was possible for the IC system to cool the reactor too rapidly shortly after shutdown which could result in undesirable thermal stress on the containment structures  To avoid this  the protocol called for reactor operators to manually open and close the condenser loop using electrically operated control valves                                    
After the construction of Unit    the following units were designed with new open cycle reactor core isolation cooling  RCIC  systems  This new system used the steam from the reactor vessel to drive a turbine which would power a pump to inject water into the pressure vessel from an external storage tank to maintain the water level in the reactor vessel and was designed to operate for at least   hours  until the depletion of coolant or mechanical failure   Additionally  this system could be converted into a closed loop system which draws coolant from the suppression chamber  SC  instead of the storage tank  should the storage tank be depleted  Although this system could function autonomously without an external energy source  besides the steam from the reactor   direct current  DC  was needed to remotely control it and receive parameters and indications and alternating current  AC  was required to power the isolation valves                                 
In an emergency where backup on site power was partially damaged or insufficient to last until a grid connection to off site power could be restored  these cooling systems could no longer be relied upon to reliably cool the reactor  In such a case  the expected procedure was to vent both the reactor vessel and primary containment using electrically or pneumatically operated valves using the remaining electricity on site  This would lower the reactor pressure sufficiently to allow for low pressure injection of water into the reactor using the fire protection system to replenish water lost to evaporation             

On site backup power edit 
Station operators switched the reactor control to off site power for shutdown  but the system was damaged by the earthquake  Emergency diesel generators  EDG  then automatically started to provide AC power                                   Two EDGs were available for each of units     and three for unit                                                Of the    EDGs     were water cooled and placed in the basements about          m below the ground level  The coolant water for the EDGs was carried by several seawater pumps placed on the shoreline which also provide water for the main condenser  These components were unhoused and only protected by the seawall  The other three EDGs were air cooled and were connected to units       and    The air cooled EDGs for units   and   were placed on the ground floor of the spent fuel building  but the switches and various other components were located below  in the basement  The third air cooled EDG was in a separate building placed inland and at higher elevations  Although these EDGs are intended to be used with their respective reactors  switchable interconnections between unit pairs    and      and    and   and    allowed reactors to share EDGs should the need arise                                    
The power station was also equipped with backup DC batteries kept charged by AC power at all times  designed to be able to power the station for approximately   hours without EDGs  In units       and    the batteries were located in the basements alongside the EDGs  In units       and    the batteries were located in the turbine building where they were raised above ground level

Earthquake tolerance edit 
The original design basis was a zero point ground acceleration of     Gal and a static acceleration of     Gal  based on the      Kern County earthquake       g           m s            ft s    After the      Miyagi earthquake  when the ground acceleration reached            g            m s            ft s   for         seconds  no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was found              In       the design of the reactors was reevaluated with new standards requiring the reactors to withstand accelerations ranging up to     Gal                        

Venting systems edit 
In the event of an emergency  operators planned to pump water into the reactors to keep them cool  This would inevitably create steam which should not be very radioactive because the fuel would still be in the primary containment vessel  Therefore  the steam would manually be released by venting valves to prevent a high pressure explosion

Earthquake edit 
The     MW earthquake occurred at       on Friday     March       with the epicenter off of the east coast of the T hoku region              It produced a maximum ground g force of     Gal      Gal      Gal at units       and   respectively  This exceeded the seismic reactor design tolerances of     Gal      Gal  and     Gal for continued operation  but the seismic values were within the design tolerances of unit               
Upon detecting the earthquake  all three operating reactors  units       and    automatically shut down  Due to expected grid failure and damage to the switch station as a result of the earthquake  the power station automatically started up the EDGs  isolated the reactor from the primary coolant loops  and activated the emergency shutdown cooling systems                                 

Tsunami and loss of power edit 
The largest tsunami wave was            m        feet  high and hit approximately    minutes after the initial earthquake  overtopping the seawall and exceeding the plant s ground level  which was         m          ft  above sea level             
The waves first damaged the seawater pumps along the shoreline     of the plant s    cooling systems for the emergency diesel generators  EDG   The waves then flooded all turbine and reactor buildings  damaging EDGs and other electrical components and connections located on the ground or basement levels                                                            at approximately                    The switching stations that provided power from the three EDGs located higher on the hillside also failed when the building that housed them flooded              One air cooled EDG  that of unit    was unaffected by the flooding and continued to operate  The DC batteries for units       and   were also inoperable shortly after flooding                                    
As a result  units     lost AC power and DC power was lost in units       and                                       In response  the operators assumed a loss of coolant in units   and   and developed a plan in which they would vent the primary containment and inject water into the reactor vessels with firefighting equipment                                  Tokyo Electric Power Company  TEPCO   the utility operator and owner  notified authorities of a  first level emergency              
Two workers were killed by the impact of the tsunami             

Reactors edit 
Unit   edit 
Main article  Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster  Unit   Reactor 
The isolation condenser  IC  was functioning prior to the tsunami  but the DC operated control valve outside of the primary containment had been in the closed position at the time to prevent thermal stresses on the reactor components  Some indications in the control room stopped functioning and operators correctly assumed loss of coolant  LOC   At       on    March  a few hours after the tsunami  operators attempted to manually open the IC control valve  but the IC failed to function  suggesting that the isolation valves were closed  Although they were kept open during IC operation  the loss of DC power in unit    which occurred shortly before the loss of AC power  automatically closed the AC powered isolation valves to prevent uncontrolled cooling or a potential LOC  Although this status was unknown to the plant operators  they correctly interpreted the loss of function in the IC system and manually closed the control valves  The plant operators would continue to periodically attempt to restart the IC in the following hours and days  but it did not function                                    
The plant operators then attempted to use the building s fire protection  FP  equipment  operated by a diesel driven fire pump  DDFP   to inject water into the reactor vessel  However  the reactor pressure had already increased to many times greater than the limit of the DDFP  Additionally  the team detected high levels of radiation within the secondary confinement structure  indicating damage to the reactor core  and found that the primary containment vessel  PCV  pressure           MPa  exceeded design specifications             MPa   In response to this new information  the reactor operators began planning to lower the PCV pressure by venting  The PCV reached its maximum pressure of           MPa at       on    March  after which it stabilized around          MPa  The decrease in pressure was due to an uncontrolled vent via an unknown pathway  The plant was notified Okuma town completed evacuation at      on    March  The staff subsequently began controlled venting  Venting of the PCV was completed later that afternoon at                                          
At the same time  pressure in the reactor vessel had been decreasing to equalize with the PCV  and the workers prepared to inject water into the reactor vessel using the DDFP once the pressure had decreased below the          MPa limit  Unfortunately  the DDFP was found to be inoperable and a fire truck had to be connected to the FP system  This process took about   hours  as the FP injection port was hidden under debris  The next morning     March          approximately    hours after the loss of power  freshwater injection into the reactor vessel began  later replaced by a water line at       leading directly from the water storage tank to the injection port to allow for continuous operation  the fire engine had to be periodically refilled   This continued into the afternoon until the freshwater tank was nearly depleted  In response  injection stopped at       and the injection of seawater  which had collected in a nearby valve pit  the only other source of water   began                                 
Power was restored to units    and    using a mobile generator at       on    March                                             
At        a hydrogen explosion damaged the secondary confinement structure  the RB   The workers evacuated shortly after the explosion  The debris produced by the explosion damaged the mobile emergency power generator and the seawater injection lines  The seawater injection lines were repaired and put back into operation at       until the valve pit was nearly depleted of seawater at       on the   th  The seawater injection was temporarily stopped in order to refill the valve pit with seawater using a variety of emergency service and JSDF vehicles  However  the process of restarting seawater injection was interrupted by another explosion in unit   RB at       which damaged water lines and prompted another evacuation  Injection of seawater into unit   would not resume until that evening  after    hours without cooling                                                            
Subsequent analysis in November      suggested that this extended period without cooling resulted in the melting of the fuel in unit    most of which would have escaped the reactor pressure vessel  RPV  and embedded itself into the concrete at the base of the PCV  Although at the time it was difficult to determine how far the fuel had eroded and diffused into the concrete  it was estimated that the fuel remained within the PCV             
Computer simulations  from       suggest  the melted fuel in Unit    whose core damage was the most extensive  had breached the bottom of the primary containment vessel and had even partially eaten into its concrete foundation  coming within about         cm         ft  of leaking into the ground               A Kyoto University nuclear engineer said with regard to these estimates   We just can t be sure until we actually see the inside of the reactors              

Unit   edit 
Main article  Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster  Unit   Reactor 
Unit   was the only other operating reactor which experienced a total loss of AC and DC power  Before the blackout  the RCIC was functioning as designed without the need for operator intervention  The safety relief valves  SRVs  would intermittently release steam directly into the PCV suppression torus at its design pressure and the RCIC properly replenished lost coolant  However  following the total blackout of Unit    the plant operators  similar to Unit    assumed the worst case scenario and prepared for a LOC incident  However  when a team was sent to investigate the status of the RCIC of unit   the following morning          they confirmed that the RCIC was operating with the PCV pressure well below design limits  Based on this information  efforts were focused on unit                                    However  the condensate storage tank from which the RCIC draws water was nearly depleted by the early morning  and so the RCIC was manually reconfigured at       to recirculate water from the suppression chamber instead             
On the   th  unit   was configured to vent the PCV automatically  manually opening all valves  leaving only the rupture disk  and preparations were made to inject seawater from the valve pit via the FP system should the need arise  However  as a result of the explosion in unit   the following day  the seawater injection setup was damaged and the isolation valve for the PCV vent was found to be closed and inoperable                                    
At       on the   th  the RCIC pump for unit   failed after    hours of continuous operation  With no way to vent the PCV  in response  a plan was devised to delay containment failure by venting the reactor vessel into the PCV using the SRVs to allow for seawater injection into the reactor vessel                                    
The following morning     March          another explosion was heard on site coinciding with a rapid drop of suppression chamber pressure to atmospheric pressure  interpreted as a malfunction of suppression chamber pressure measurement  Due to concerns about the growing radiological hazard on site  almost all workers evacuated to the Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant

Although AC power was lost  some DC power was still available in unit   and the workers were able to remotely confirm that the RCIC system was continuing to cool the reactor  However  knowing that their DC supply was limited  the workers managed to extend the backup DC supply to about   days by disconnecting nonessential equipment  until replacement batteries were brought from a neighboring power station on the morning of the   th  with   hours between loss and restoration of DC power   At       the next day  after      hours of operation  the RCIC system failed  In response  the high pressure coolant injection  HPCI  system was activated to alleviate the lack of cooling while workers continued to attempt to restart the RCIC  Additionally  the FP system was used to spray the PCV  mainly the SC  with water in order to slow the climbing temperatures and pressures of the PCV                                    
On the morning of the   th          after DC power was restored by new batteries                         the HPCI system showed signs of malfunction  The HPCI isolation valve failed to activate automatically upon achieving a certain pressure  In response  the workers switched off HPCI and began injection of water via the lower pressure firefighting equipment  However  the workers found that the SRVs did not operate to relieve pressure from the reactor vessel to allow water injection by the DDFP  In response  workers attempted to restart the HPCI and RCIC systems  but both failed to restart  Following this loss of cooling  workers established a water line from the valve pit to inject seawater into the reactor alongside unit    However  water could not be injected due to RPV pressures exceeding the pump capability  Similarly  preparations were also made to vent the unit   PCV  but PCV pressure was not sufficient to burst the rupture disk                                    
Later that morning         workers were able to depressurize the reactor by operating the safety relief valves using batteries collected from nearby automobiles  This was shortly followed by the bursting of the venting line rupture disk and the depressurization of the PCV  Unfortunately  venting was quickly stopped by a pneumatic isolation valve which closed on the vent path due to a lack of compressed air  and venting was not resumed until over   hours later once an external air compressor could be installed  Despite this  the reactor pressure was immediately low enough to allow for water injection  borated freshwater  as ordered by TEPCO  using the FP system until the freshwater FP tanks were depleted  at which point the injected coolant was switched to seawater from the valve pit                                 
Cooling was lost once the valve pit was depleted but was resumed two hours later  unit   cooling was postponed until the valve pit was filled   However  despite being cooled  PCV pressure continued to rise and the RPV water level continued to drop until the fuel became uncovered on the morning of the   th         as indicated by a water level gauge  which was followed by workers evacuating the area out of concerns about a possible second hydrogen explosion similar to unit                                   
Shortly after work resumed to reestablish coolant lines  an explosion occurred in unit   RB at       on    March  which further delayed unit   cooling and damaged unit   s coolant lines  Work to reestablish seawater cooling directly from the ocean began two hours later  and cooling of unit   resumed in the afternoon  approximately        and continued until cooling was lost once more as a result of site evacuation on the   th

On    March  an explosion was observed at unit   RB during site evacuation  A team later returned to the power station to inspect unit    but were unable to do so due to the present radiological hazard                                  The explosion damaged the fourth floor rooftop area of Unit    creating two large holes in a wall of the reactor building  RB   The explosion was likely caused by hydrogen passing to unit   from unit   through shared pipes                                       
The following day  on the   th  an aerial inspection was performed by helicopter which confirmed there was sufficient water remaining in the SFP  On the   th  water was sprayed into the uncovered SFP  later replaced by a concrete pump truck with a boom on the   nd                                 

Unit   edit 
Unit   was fueled and was undergoing an RPV pressure test at the time of the accident  but the pressure was maintained by an external air compressor and the reactor was not otherwise operating  Removal of decay heat using the RCIC was not possible  as the reactor was not producing sufficient steam                                     However  the water within the RPV proved sufficient to cool the fuel  with the SRVs venting into the PCV  until AC power was restored on    March using the unit   interconnection  allowing the use of the low pressure pumps of the residual heat removal  RHR  system  Unit   was the first to achieve a cold shutdown in the afternoon on the   th

On    March  temperatures in the fuel pond had risen slightly  to          C            F   and water was sprayed over the pool              Power was restored to cooling systems on    March and by    March  temperatures were reported down to          C           F                                   The town of Namie  population         was evacuated as a result of the accident             
Radionuclide release edit 
Radiation measurements from Fukushima Prefecture  March                 
Quantities of the released material are expressed in terms of the three predominant products released  caesium      iodine      and xenon      Estimates for atmospheric releases range from           PBq for Cs                   PBq for I      and                   PBq for Xe                                                                        Once released into the atmosphere  those which remain in a gaseous phase will simply be diluted by the atmosphere  but some which precipitate will eventually settle on land or in the ocean  Approximately        of the atmospheric caesium     was deposited in the ocean                          Thus  the majority          of the radionuclides which are deposited are isotopes of iodine and caesium  with a small portion of tellurium  which are almost fully vaporized out of the core due to their high vapor pressure  The remaining fraction of deposited radionuclides are of less volatile elements such as barium  antimony  and niobium  of which less than a percent is evaporated from the fuel             
In addition to atmospheric deposition  there was also a significant quantity of direct releases into groundwater  and eventually the ocean  through leaks of coolant which had been in direct contact with the fuel  Estimates for this release vary from   to          PBq caesium     and            PBq iodine                                      
According to the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety  the release from the accident represents the most important individual oceanic emissions of artificial radioactivity ever observed  The Fukushima coast has one of the world s strongest currents  Kuroshio Current   It transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean  dispersing the radioactivity  As of late       measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments suggested that the consequences for marine life would be minor  Significant pollution along the coast near the plant might persist  because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported to the sea by surface water crossing contaminated soil  The possible presence of other radioactive substances  such as strontium    or plutonium  had not been sufficiently studied  Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species  mostly fish  caught along the Fukushima coast             

Consequences edit 
Evacuation edit 
Immediate response edit

In response to the station blackout during the initial hours of the accident and the ongoing uncertainty regarding the cooling status of units   and    a        km radius evacuation of       residents was ordered at                    However  due to difficulty coordinating with the national government              a        km evacuation order of        residents and a         km shelter in place order for        residents was established nearly simultaneously at        The evacuation radius was expanded to         km at       and was then revised to         km at        The size of these evacuation zones was set for arbitrary reasons at the discretion of bureaucrats rather than nuclear experts              Communication between different authorities was scattered and at several times the local governments learned the status of evacuation via the televised news media                                                                                    Citizens were informed by radio  trucks with megaphones  and door to door visits                                                                        Many municipalities independently ordered evacuations ahead of orders from the national government due to loss of communication with authorities                                                    at the time of the        km evacuation order  the majority of residents within the zone had already evacuated                                   
Due to the multiple overlapping evacuation orders  many residents had evacuated to areas which would shortly be designated as evacuation areas  This resulted in many residents having to move multiple times until they reached an area outside of the final         km evacuation zone                                            of residents who were within the initial        km radius had to evacuate more than six times             
Additionally  a         km shelter in place order was communicated on the   th  although some municipalities within this zone had already decided to evacuate their residents  This order was followed by a voluntary evacuation recommendation on the   th                                                           although the majority of residents had evacuated from the         km zone by then                                        The shelter in place order was lifted on    April  but the evacuation recommendation remained                                   

Fatalities edit 
Of an estimated       patients and elderly who resided within hospitals and nursing homes within the         km evacuation zone                 fatalities are attributed to the evacuation              There was one suspected death due to radiation  as one person died   years later of a lung cancer possibly triggered by it            

Communication failures edit 
The Japanese public felt that the government and TEPCO provided limited information about the accident in the early weeks              Expert analysis of the accident that was understandable to lay persons was not given by the government or TEPCO  but by Masashi Got   a retired reactor vessel designer at Toshiba  the company that manufactured four of the six of reactor units              Got  had a series of press briefings at the Foreign Correspondents  Club of Japan starting from    March                              
There were several instances early in the accident response in which data about the accident was not properly handled  The Ministry of Education  Culture  Sports  Science and Technology only sent data from the SPEEDI network to the Fukushima prefectural government             and was later criticized for delaying the communication of data to the U S  military              Additionally  the U S  military produced a detailed map using aircraft and provided it to the Ministry of Economy  Trade and Industry  METI  on    March and to the Ministry of Education  Culture  Sports  Science and Technology  MEXT  two days later  but no new evacuation plans were made a week after the accident                          The data was not forwarded to the Nuclear Safety Commission  but was made public by the United States on the   rd             

TEPCO officials were instructed not to use the phrase  core meltdown  in order to conceal the meltdown until they officially recognized it two months after the accident             Japan towns  villages  and cities in and around the Daiichi nuclear plant exclusion zone  The    and         km     and         mi  areas had evacuation and shelter in place orders  and additional administrative districts that had an evacuation order are highlighted  However  the above map s factual accuracy is called into question as only the southern portion of Kawamata district had evacuation orders  More accurate maps are available                         
The Japanese government did not keep records of key meetings during the crisis              Emails from the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency to the Fukushima prefectural government  including evacuation and health advisories from    March       to    March        went unread and were deleted             

Mental health and evacuation side effects edit 
Evacuation flight departs Misawa             
In January       the number of residents displaced due to the accident was around          peaking at         in June                                        In terms of months of life lost  the loss of life would have been far smaller if all residents had done nothing at all  or were sheltered in place  instead of evacuated                         
In the former Soviet Union  many patients with negligible radioactive exposure after the Chernobyl accident displayed extreme anxiety about radiation exposure  They developed many psychosomatic problems  including radiophobia along with an increase in fatalistic alcoholism  As Japanese health and radiation specialist Shunichi Yamashita noted             

We know from Chernobyl that the psychological consequences are enormous  Life expectancy of the evacuees dropped from    to    years   not because of cancer  but because of depression  alcoholism  and suicide  Relocation is not easy  the stress is very big  We must not only track those problems  but also treat them  Otherwise people will feel they are just guinea pigs in our research             
A      survey by the Iitate local government obtained responses from approximately       evacuees within the evacuation zone  The survey showed that many residents are experiencing growing frustration  instability  and an inability to return to their earlier lives  Sixty percent of respondents stated that their health and the health of their families had deteriorated after evacuating  while       reported feeling more irritated compared to before the accident             


Summarizing all responses to questions related to evacuees  current family status  one third of all surveyed families live apart from their children  while       live away from other family members  including elderly parents  with whom they lived before the disaster  The survey also showed that       of the evacuees have suffered salary cuts of     or more since the outbreak of the nuclear disaster  A total of       reported a lack of sleep  while       reported smoking or drinking more than before they evacuated             


Stress often manifests in physical ailments  including behavioral changes such as poor dietary choices  lack of exercise  and sleep deprivation  Survivors  including some who lost homes  villages  and family members  were found likely to face mental health and physical challenges  Much of the stress came from lack of information and from relocation                         
A      metareview of    articles indexed by PubMed  PsycINFO  and EMBASE  highlighted several psychophysical consequences among the residents in Miyagi  Iwate  Ibaraki  Tochigi and Tokyo  The metareview found mass fear among Fukushima residents which was associated with depressive symptoms  anxiety  sleep disturbance  post traumatic stress disorder  maternal distress  and distress among the employees of the nuclear plant              The rates of psychological distress among evacuated people rose fivefold compared to the Japanese average due to the experience of the accident and evacuation              An increase in childhood obesity in the area after the accident has also been attributed to recommendations that children stay indoors instead of going outside to play             

Energy policy edit

Prior to the accident  over     of domestic electricity generation in Japan used nuclear power             and Japan had set a fairly ambitious green house gas  GHG  reduction target of     below      levels by       which involved increasing the share of nuclear power in electricity generation from     to                                                  However  this plan was abandoned and the target was revised to a      emissions increase by      following the accident              alongside a focus on reducing dependence on nuclear power in favor of improved thermal efficiency in fossil fuel energy use and increasing the share of  renewables                                    The contribution of nuclear energy dropped to less than one percent following the accident             and all nuclear reactors in the country were shut down by                                        This resulted in an increase in the share of fossil fuel energy use  which had increased to      by       the highest of any IEA member state  with the remaining     produced by renewables  an increase from    in                    The required fossil fuel imports in      resulted in a trade deficit for the first time in decades which would continue in the following decade                                  
In the immediate aftermath  nine prefectures served by TEPCO experienced power rationing               The government asked major companies to reduce power consumption by      and some shifted their work hours to smooth power demand                            As of       TEPCO and eight other Japanese power companies were paying approximately     trillion JPY     billion USD  more in combined imported fossil fuel costs compared to      to make up for the missing power              

Elections edit 
On    December       Japan held a general election  The Liberal Democratic Party  LDP  had a clear victory  with Shinz  Abe as the new Prime Minister  Abe supported nuclear power  saying that leaving the plants closed was costing the country   trillion yen per year in higher costs  The comment came after Junichiro Koizumi  who chose Abe to succeed him as premier  made a statement to urge the government to take a stance against using nuclear power                            A survey on local mayors by the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper in      found that most of them from cities hosting nuclear plants would agree to restarting the reactors  provided the government could guarantee their safety               More than        people marched on   June       in Tokyo against restarting nuclear power plants  Marchers had gathered more than   million petition signatures opposing nuclear power              
Previously a proponent of building more reactors  Prime Minister Naoto Kan took an increasingly anti nuclear stance following the accident  In May       he ordered the aging Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant closed over earthquake and tsunami concerns  and said he would freeze building plans  In July       Kan said   Japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy

In May       UK chief inspector of nuclear installations Mike Weightman traveled to Japan as the lead of an International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  expert mission  The main finding of this mission  as reported to the IAEA ministerial conference that month  was that risks associated with tsunamis in several sites in Japan had been underestimated              
In September       IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said the Japanese nuclear disaster  caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power                Following the accident  the IAEA halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by

In the aftermath   Germany accelerated plans to close its nuclear power reactors and decided to phase out the rest by                    German media coverage conflated the casualties of the earthquake and tsunami  with casualties of the nuclear incident               Belgium and Switzerland also changed their nuclear policies to phase out all nuclear energy operations                            Italy held a national referendum  in which    percent voted against the government s plan to build new nuclear power plants               In France  President Hollande announced the intention of the government to reduce nuclear usage by one third  However  the government earmarked only one power station for closure   the aging Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant on the German border   which prompted some to question the government s commitment to Hollande s promise  Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg stated Fessenheim will be the only nuclear power station to close  On a visit to China in December      he reassured his audience that nuclear energy was a  sector of the future  and would continue to contribute  at least      of France s electricity output               Another member of Hollande s Socialist Party  Christian Bataille  said that Hollande announced the nuclear curb to secure the backing of his Green coalition partners in parliament              

China continued developing nuclear power in the decade following  In       China had hoped to have         gigawatts of nuclear capacity by            times more than it had in

The number of nuclear power plant constructions started each year worldwide  from      to       Following an increase in new constructions from      to       there was a decline after the Fukushima nuclear accident              
New nuclear projects were proceeding in some countries  The consulting firm KPMG reported in      that     new nuclear facilities were planned or proposed for completion by                    In       the United Kingdom was planning a major nuclear expansion despite some public objection  Russia had similar plans               In       India was also pressing ahead with a large nuclear program  as was South Korea               Indian Vice President M  Hamid Ansari said in      that  nuclear energy is the only option  for expanding India s energy supplies               and Prime Minister Modi announced in      that India intended to build    more nuclear reactors in a collaboration with Russia

Radiation effects in humans edit 
Main article  Radiation effects from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster
Seawater contamination along coast with Caesium      from    March until   May                  Radiation exposure of those living in proximity to the accident site was estimated at       mSV in the year following the accident                                   Residents of Fukushima City were estimated to have received   mSv in the same time period               In comparison  the dosage of background radiation received over a lifetime is     mSv               Very few or no detectable cancers are expected as a result of accumulated radiation exposures                                                      Residents who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health effects were likely to be below detectable levels                                                 There is no increase in miscarriages  stillbirths or physical and mental disorders in babies born after the accident                                                                        
Outside the geographical areas most affected by radiation  even in locations within Fukushima prefecture  the predicted risks remain low  and no observable increases in cancer above natural variation in baseline rates are anticipated         World Health Organization      Estimated effective doses outside Japan are considered to be below  or far below  the levels regarded as very small by the international radiological protection community                                                 Canadian academic studies failed to show any significant amount of radiation in the coastal waters off Canada s west coast               The report s author received death threats from supporters promoting the idea of a  wave of cancer deaths across North America               
The World Health Organization  WHO   United Nations  UN   and other researchers were particularly concerned about thyroid cancer as a result of the radiation                                                                          In January       six such patients who were children at the time of the accident sued TEPCO for     million yen after developing thyroid cancer               The current scientific consensus suggests that the increase in detectable Thyroid cancers falls within statistical background noise due to the screening effect  and that the cancers do not have chromosomal aberrations consistent with exposure to ionizing radiation excepting that which is caused by CT Scan                            However  the authors of a dose response relationship study from      also claim that the incidence of Thyroid cancers may be underreported due to societal and political pressure              
Leukemia  breast cancer  and other solid cancers were studied by the WHO  Increase in lifetime cancer relative to baseline risk for infants was reported because these represent an upper bound for the cancer related health risks               The WHO notes that a large increase in thyroid cancer is partially due to extremely low baseline rates

Linear no threshold models  LNT  edit 
LNT models estimate that the accident would most likely cause     cancer deaths               However  LNT models have large uncertainties and are not useful for estimating health effects from radiation                            especially when the effects of radiation on the human body are not linear  and with obvious thresholds               The WHO reports that the radiation levels from the accident were below the thresholds for deterministic effects from radiation                                  

Radiation effects in non humans edit 
On    March       the first restrictions were placed on the distribution and consumption of contaminated items               However  the results of measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident  in terms of radioactivity  would be minor for marine life as of autumn       Despite caesium isotopic concentrations in the waters off Japan being    to      times above the normal concentrations prior to the accident  radiation risks are below what is generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers              
Marine life has been tested for cesium and other radionuclides since the accident  These studies found elevated levels of cesium in marine life from      to                                 Migratory pelagic species are also highly effective and rapid transporters of pollutants throughout the ocean  Elevated levels of Cs     appeared in migratory species off the coast of California that were not seen prior to the accident              
In April       studies confirmed the presence of radioactive tuna off the coasts of the Pacific U S               Researchers carried out tests on    albacore tuna caught prior to the      power plant accident and those caught after  However  the amount of radioactivity is less than that found naturally in a single banana               Cs     and Cs     have been noted in Japanese whiting in Tokyo Bay as of        Concentration of radiocesium in the Japanese whiting was one or two orders of magnitude higher than that in the sea water  and an order of magnitude lower than that in the sediment   They were still within food safety limits              
In June       the political advocacy group  International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War   asserted that         people have been unable to return to their homes and ecological diversity has decreased and malformations have been found in trees  birds  and mammals               Although physiological abnormalities have been reported within the vicinity of the accident zone               the scientific community has largely rejected any such findings of genetic or mutagenic damage caused by radiation  instead showing it can be attributed either to experimental error or other toxic effects              
In February       Japan renewed the export of fish caught off Fukushima s nearshore zone  According to prefecture officials  no seafood had been found with radiation levels exceeding Japan safety standards since April       In       Thailand was the first country to receive a shipment of fresh fish from Japan s Fukushima prefecture               A group campaigning to help prevent global warming has demanded the Food and Drug Administration disclose the name of the importer of fish from Fukushima and of the Japanese restaurants in Bangkok serving it  Srisuwan Janya  chairman of the Stop Global Warming Association  said the FDA must protect the rights of consumers by ordering restaurants serving Fukushima fish to make that information available to their customers  so they could decide whether to eat it or not              
In February       Japan suspended the sale of black rockfish from Fukushima after it was discovered that one fish from Soma had     times more radioactive Cesium     than legally permitted  The high levels of radioactivity led investigators to believe it had escaped from a breakwater at the accident site  despite nets intended to prevent fish from leaving the area  Forty four other fish from the accident site have shown similar levels

Three investigations into the accident showed the man made nature of the catastrophe and its roots in regulatory capture associated with a  network of corruption  collusion  and nepotism                             A New York Times report found that the Japanese nuclear regulatory system consistently sided with  and promoted  the nuclear industry based on the concept of amakudari   descent from heaven    in which senior regulators accepted high paying jobs at companies they once oversaw              
In August       several top energy officials were fired from their jobs by the Japanese government  affected positions included the Vice minister for Economy  Trade and Industry  the head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency  and the head of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy              
In      three former TEPCO executives  chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata and two vice presidents  were indicted for negligence resulting in death and injury                            The three pleaded not guilty  and in September       the court agreed                           

NAIIC edit 
Main article  National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission
The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission  NAIIC  was the first independent investigation commission by the National Diet in the    year history of Japan s constitutional government                                   
The chairman highlighted that it was foreseeable and preventable               The commission s findings included that the government and TEPCO lacked the sense that they were the ones responsible for protecting society   They effectively betrayed the nation s right to be safe from nuclear accidents                The commission argued that the accident had particularly Japanese characteristics because its causes were linked to  conventions of Japanese culture  such as obedience   reluctance to question authority   and groupism              
The Commission recognized that the affected residents were still struggling and facing grave concerns  including the  health effects of radiation exposure  displacement  the dissolution of families  disruption of their lives and lifestyles and the contamination of vast areas of the environment                                    

ICANPS edit 
Main article  Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company
The purpose of the Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations  ICANPS  was to identify the accident s causes and propose policies designed to minimize the damage and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents               The    member  government appointed panel included scholars  journalists  lawyers  and engineers                            It was supported by public prosecutors and government experts              and released its final     page              investigation report on    July                                
The panel s report faulted an inadequate legal system for nuclear crisis management  a crisis command disarray caused by the government and TEPCO  and possible excess meddling on the part of Prime Minister Naoto Kan s office in the crisis  early stage               The panel concluded that a culture of complacency about nuclear safety and poor crisis management led to the nuclear accident              

Remediation and recovery edit 
IAEA team examining Unit               
To assuage fears  the government enacted an order to decontaminate over a hundred areas where the level of additional radiation was greater than one millisievert per year  This is a much lower threshold than is necessary for protecting health  The government also sought to address the lack of education on the effects of radiation and the extent to which the average person was exposed              
In       tours to visit the accident area began               In September       The Great East Japan Earthquake and Nuclear Disaster Memorial Museum was opened in the town of Futaba  near the power plant  The museum exhibits items and videos about the earthquake and the nuclear accident  To attract visitors from abroad  the museum offers explanations in English  Chinese  and Korean              

Fuel removal edit 
Main article  Fukushima disaster cleanup
TEPCO plans to remove the remaining nuclear fuel material from the plants  TEPCO completed the removal of      fuel assemblies from the Unit   spent fuel pool in December      and     fuel assemblies from the Unit   spent fuel pool in February                    TEPCO plans to remove all fuel rods from the spent fuel pools of Units          and   by      and to remove the remaining molten fuel debris from the reactor containments of Units       and   by      or                    Plant management estimated the ongoing intensive cleanup program to both decontaminate affected areas and decommission the plant will take    to    years from the accident              

Treating contaminated water edit 
Main article  Discharge of radioactive water of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant
As of       about     metric tons      long tons      short tons  of cooling water per day was being pumped into the reactors  Another     metric tons      long tons      short tons  of groundwater was seeping into the structure  Some     metric tons      long tons      short tons  of water per day was removed for treatment  half of which was reused for cooling and half diverted to storage tanks               Ultimately the contaminated water  after treatment to remove radionuclides other than tritium  has to be discharged into the Pacific ocean               TEPCO created an underground ice wall to block the flow of groundwater into the reactor buildings  A      million     MW cooling facility freezes the ground to a depth of    meters                            As of       the contaminated water generation had been reduced to     metric tons      long tons      short tons  per day              
In February       NHK reported that TEPCO was reviewing its radioactivity data  after finding much higher levels of radioactivity than was reported earlier  Groundwater collected in July      contained   MBq       millicuries  of strontium per liter          MBq imp      gal          MBq U S       gal            Ci imp      gal            Ci U S       gal  not the     kBq       millicuries            MBq imp      gal           MBq U S       gal            Ci imp      gal           Ci U S       gal  that were initially reported                           
On    September       floodwaters driven by Typhoon Etau prompted mass evacuations in Japan and overwhelmed the drainage pumps at the stricken power plant  Hundreds of metric tons of radioactive water entered the ocean as a result               Plastic bags filled with contaminated soil and grass were also swept away by the flood waters              
As of October            million cubic meters of contaminated water was stored in the plant area  The water is being treated by a purification system that can remove radionuclides  except tritium  to a level that Japanese regulations allow to be discharged to the sea  As of December           of the water had been purified to the required level  while the remaining     needed additional purification  However  tritium cannot be separated from the water  As of October       the total amount of tritium in the water was about     terabecquerels  and the average tritium concentration was about      megabecquerels per liter              
A      committee set up by the Japanese Government concluded that the purified water should be released to the sea or evaporated to the atmosphere  The committee calculated that discharging all the water to the sea in one year would cause a radiation dose of      microsieverts to the local people  whereas evaporation would cause     microsieverts  For comparison  Japanese people get      microsieverts per year from natural radiation               IAEA considers that the dose calculation method is appropriate  Further  the IAEA recommended that a decision on the water disposal must be made urgently               Despite the negligible doses  the Japanese committee is concerned that the water disposal may cause reputational damage to the prefecture  especially to the fishing industry and to tourism              
In       Japan s Nuclear Regulation Authority warned that the some of       waste storage containers for the radioactive slurry were degrading faster than expected  Due to the fact that transferring the slurry to a new container was very time consuming  this posed an urgent problem              
Tanks used to store the water were expected to be filled in       In July       Japan s Nuclear Regulation Authority approved discharging the treated water into the sea               Japan said the water is safe  many scientists agreed  and the decision came weeks after the UN s nuclear watchdog approved the plan  but critics say more studies need to be done and the release should be halted                           In August  Japan began the discharge of treated waste water into the Pacific Ocean  sparking protests in the region and retaliation from China  who blocked all imports of seafood from Japan                           Discharges were planned to occur over the subsequent    years to release all the water               A US State Department spokesperson supported the decision  South Korea s foreign minister and activists from Japan and South Korea protested the announcement              In April       fishers and activists held protests in front of the Japanese embassy in the Philippines in opposition to the planned release of     million tons of treated water into the Pacific Ocean              

Compensation and government expenses edit 
Initial estimates of costs to Japanese taxpayers were in excess of     trillion       billion inflation adjusted                In December      the government estimated decontamination  compensation  decommissioning  and radioactive waste storage costs at       trillion       billion inflation adjusted   nearly double the      estimate               By             trillion had already been spent  with    trillion on compensation     trillion on decontamination  and    trillion on decommissioning and storage  Despite concerns  the government expected total costs to remain under budget                           
In March       a Japanese court ruled that negligence by the Japanese government had led to the Fukushima accident by failing to use its regulatory powers to force TEPCO to take preventive measures  The Maebashi district court near Tokyo awarded     million           inflation adjusted  to     people who were forced to flee their homes following the accident               On    September       the Sendai High Court ruled that the Japanese government and TEPCO are responsible for the accident  ordering them to pay      million in damages to residents for their lost livelihoods               In March       Japan s Supreme Court rejected an appeal from TEPCO and upheld the order for it to pay damages of      billion      million  to about       people whose lives were harmed by the accident  Its decision covered three class action lawsuits  among more than    filed against the utility              
On    June       the Supreme Court acquitted the government of any wrongdoing regarding potential compensation to over       people affected by the accident              
On    July       four former TEPCO executives were ordered to pay     trillion      billion  in damages to the operator of the power plant  in the civil case brought by TEPCO shareholders              

Equipment  facility  and operational changes edit 
A number of nuclear reactor safety system lessons emerged from the incident  The most obvious was that in tsunami prone areas  a power station s sea wall must be adequately tall and robust              At the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant  closer to the epicenter of the    March      earthquake and tsunami               the sea wall was    meters          ft  tall and successfully withstood the tsunami  preventing serious damage and radioactivity releases                           
Nuclear power station operators around the world began to install passive autocatalytic recombiners   PARs    which do not require electricity to operate                                         PARs work much like the catalytic converter on the exhaust of a car to turn potentially explosive gases such as hydrogen into water  Had such devices been positioned at the top of the reactor buildings  where hydrogen gas collected  the explosions would not have occurred and the releases of radioactive isotopes may have been less              
Unpowered filtering systems on containment building vent lines  known as Filtered Containment Venting Systems  FCVS   can safely catch radioactive materials and thereby allow reactor core depressurization  with steam and hydrogen venting with minimal radioactivity emissions                            Filtration using an external water tank system is the most common established system in European countries  with the water tank positioned outside the containment building               In       TEPCO installed additional filters  vents  and other safety systems at Kashiwazaki Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant              
For Generation II reactors located in flood or tsunami prone areas  a    day supply of back up batteries has become an informal industry standard                            Another change is to harden the location of back up diesel generator rooms with water tight  blast resistant doors and heat sinks  similar to those used by nuclear submarines              
Upon a station blackout  similar to the one that occurred after the back up battery supply was exhausted               many constructed Generation III reactors adopt the principle of passive nuclear safety  They take advantage of convection and gravity to ensure an adequate supply of cooling water to handle the decay heat  without the use of pumps                           
As the crisis unfolded  the Japanese government sent a request for robots developed by the U S  military  The robots went into the plants and took pictures to help assess the situation  but they couldn t perform the full range of tasks usually carried out by human workers               The accident illustrated that robots lacked sufficient dexterity and robustness to perform critical tasks  In response to this shortcoming  a series of competitions were hosted by DARPA to accelerate the development of humanoid robots that could supplement relief efforts                            Eventually a wide variety of specially designed robots were employed  leading to a robotics boom in the region   but as of early       three of them had promptly become non functional due to the intensity of the radioactivity              

Prior warning edit 
On   July       the NAIIC found that the causes of the accident had been foreseeable  and that TEPCO had failed to meet basic safety requirements such as risk assessment  preparing for containing collateral damage  and developing evacuation plans  At a meeting in Vienna  Austria  three months after the accident  the IAEA faulted lax oversight by the Japanese Ministry of Economy  Trade and Industry  saying the ministry faced an inherent conflict of interest as the government agency in charge of both regulating and promoting the nuclear power industry               On    October       TEPCO admitted that it had failed to take necessary measures for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants              

Tsunami studies edit 
The U S  Nuclear Regulatory Commission warned of a risk of losing emergency power in      and the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency referred to that report in       but took no action to mitigate the risk              
In       an in house TEPCO report recommended safety measures against seawater flooding  based on the potential of a    foot          m  tsunami  TEPCO did not act due to concerns about creating anxieties over the safety of the nuclear power plant              
In       the government earthquake research headquarters estimated that a tsunami up to      meters          ft  could hit the power station               These findings were supported by the cabinet office s own findings which stated that the     meters          ft  forecast by TEPCO did not cover the full range of possibility               TEPCO s in house      study identified an immediate need to better protect the facility from flooding by seawater which cited the      meters          ft  estimate from the      study              
In       the Active Fault and Earthquake Research Center urged TEPCO and the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency to revise their assumptions for possible tsunami heights upwards  based on his team s findings about the     Sanriku earthquake  but this was not seriously considered at the time                           

Unit   EDG disabled by flooding in      edit 
On    October       one of unit   s EDGs failed as a result of a condensate coolant leak in the turbine building  as reported by former employees in December       A TEPCO report in      detailed that the room was flooded through a door and some holes for cables  but the power supply was not cut off by the flooding  An engineer reported to superiors the possibility that a tsunami could damage the generators  In response  TEPCO installed doors to prevent water from leaking into the generator rooms              

Venting systems edit 
American nuclear scientists identified manually activated venting systems to be riskier than a passive approach five years prior to the accident              The venting system for unit   had several issues before its explosion                                  By       new reactor designs used passive venting systems
