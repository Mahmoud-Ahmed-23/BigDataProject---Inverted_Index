Motion capture of two pianists  right hands playing the same piece  slow motion  no sounds            
Two repetitions of a walking sequence recorded using motion capture           
Motion capture  sometimes referred as mocap or mo cap  for short  is the process of recording high resolution movement of objects or people into a computer system  It is used in military  entertainment  sports  medical applications  and for validation of computer vision            and robots            
In films  television shows and video games  motion capture refers to recording actions of human actors and using that information to animate digital character models in  D or  D computer animation                                   When it includes face and fingers or captures subtle expressions  it is often referred to as performance capture             In many fields  motion capture is sometimes called motion tracking  but in filmmaking and games  motion tracking usually refers more to match moving 
In motion capture sessions  movements of one or more actors are sampled many times per second  Whereas early techniques used images from multiple cameras to calculate  D positions             often the purpose of motion capture is to record only the movements of the actor  not their visual appearance  This animation data is mapped to a  D model so that the model performs the same actions as the actor  This process may be contrasted with the older technique of rotoscoping 
Camera movements can also be motion captured so that a virtual camera in the scene will pan  tilt or dolly around the stage driven by a camera operator while the actor is performing  At the same time  the motion capture system can capture the camera and props as well as the actor s performance  This allows the computer generated characters  images and sets to have the same perspective as the video images from the camera  A computer processes the data and displays the movements of the actor  providing the desired camera positions in terms of objects in the set  Retroactively obtaining camera movement data from the captured footage is known as match moving or camera tracking 
The first virtual actor animated by motion capture was produced in      by Didier Pourcel and his team at Gribouille  It involved  cloning  the body and face of French comedian Richard Bohringer  and then animating it with still nascent motion capture tools

Motion capture offers several advantages over traditional computer animation of a  D model 

Low latency  close to real time results can be obtained  In entertainment applications  this can reduce the costs of keyframe based animation              The Hand Over technique is an example of this 
The amount of work does not vary with the complexity or length of the performance to the same degree as when using traditional techniques  This allows many tests to be done with different styles or deliveries  giving a distinct personality that is only limited by the talent of the actor 
Complex movement and realistic physical interactions such as secondary motions  weight  and exchange of forces can be easily recreated in a physically accurate manner             
The amount of animation data that can be produced within a given time is extremely large when compared to traditional animation techniques  This contributes to both cost effectiveness and meeting production deadlines             
Potential for free software and third party solutions reducing its costs 
Disadvantages edit

Specific hardware and special software programs are required to obtain and process the data 
The cost of the software  equipment and personnel required can be prohibitive for small productions 
The capture system may have specific requirements for the space in which it is operated  depending on camera field of view or magnetic distortion 
When problems occur  it is easier to shoot the scene again rather than trying to manipulate the data  Only a few systems allow real time viewing of the data to decide if the take needs to be redone 
The initial results are limited to what can be performed within the capture volume without extra editing of the data 
Movement that does not follow the laws of physics cannot be captured 
Traditional animation techniques  such as added emphasis on anticipation and follow through  secondary motion or manipulating the shape of the character  as with squash and stretch animation techniques  must be added later 
If the computer model has different proportions from the capture subject  artifacts may occur  For example  if a cartoon character has large  oversized hands  these may intersect the character s body if the human performer is not careful with their physical motion

There are many applications of Motion Capture  The most common are for video games  movies  and movement capture  however there is a research application for this technology being used at Purdue University in robotics development 

Video games edit 
Video games often use motion capture to animate athletes  martial artists  and other in game characters                          As early as       an early form of motion capture was used to animate the  D player characters of Martech s video game Vixen  performed by model Corinne Russell              and Magical Company s  D arcade fighting game Last Apostle Puppet Show  to animate digitized sprites               Motion capture was later notably used to animate the  D character models in the Sega Model arcade games Virtua Fighter                                and Virtua Fighter                       In mid       developer publisher Acclaim Entertainment had its own in house motion capture studio built into its headquarters              Namco s      arcade game Soul Edge used passive optical system markers for motion capture              Motion capture also uses athletes in based off animated games  such as Naughty Dog s Crash Bandicoot  Insomniac Games  Spyro the Dragon  and Rare s Dinosaur Planet 

Robotics edit 
Indoor positioning is another application for optical motion capture systems  Robotics researchers often use motion capture systems when developing and evaluating control  estimation  and perception algorithms and hardware  In outdoor spaces  it s possible to achieve accuracy to the centimeter by using the Global Navigation Satellite System  GNSS  together with Real Time Kinematics  RTK   However  this reduces significantly when there is no line of sight to the satellites   such as in indoor environments  The majority of vendors selling commercial optical motion capture systems provide accessible open source drivers that integrate with the popular Robotic Operating System  ROS  framework  allowing researchers and developers to effectively test their robots during development 
In the field of aerial robotics research  motion capture systems are widely used for positioning as well  Regulations on airspace usage limit how feasible outdoor experiments can be conducted with Unmanned Aerial Systems  UAS   Indoor tests can circumvent such restrictions  Many labs and institutions around the world have built indoor motion capture volumes for this purpose 
Purdue University houses the world s largest indoor motion capture system  inside the Purdue UAS Research and Test  PURT  facility  PURT is dedicated to UAS research  and provides tracking volume of         cubic feet using    motion capture cameras              The optical motion capture system is able to track targets in its volume with millimeter accuracy  effectively providing the true position of targets   the  ground truth  baseline in research and development  Results derived from other sensors and algorithms can then be compared to the ground truth data to evaluate their performance 

Movies edit 
Movies use motion capture for CGI effects  in some cases replacing traditional cel animation  and for completely CGI creatures  such as Gollum  The Mummy  King Kong  Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean  the Na vi from the film Avatar  and Clu from Tron  Legacy  The Great Goblin  the three Stone trolls  many of the orcs and goblins in the      film The Hobbit  An Unexpected Journey  and Smaug were created using motion capture 
The film Batman Forever        used some motion capture for certain visual effects  Warner Bros  had acquired motion capture technology from arcade video game company Acclaim Entertainment for use in the film s production              Acclaim s      video game of the same name also used the same motion capture technology to animate the digitized sprite graphics             
Star Wars  Episode I   The Phantom Menace        was the first feature length film to include a main character created using motion capture  that character being Jar Jar Binks  played by Ahmed Best   and Indian American film Sinbad  Beyond the Veil of Mists        was the first feature length film made primarily with motion capture  although many character animators also worked on the film  which had a very limited release       s Final Fantasy  The Spirits Within was the first widely released movie to be made with motion capture technology  Despite its poor box office intake  supporters of motion capture technology took notice  Total Recall had already used the technique  in the scene of the x ray scanner and the skeletons 
The Lord of the Rings  The Two Towers was the first feature film to utilize a real time motion capture system  This method streamed the actions of actor Andy Serkis into the computer generated imagery skin of Gollum   Smeagol as it was being performed             
Storymind Entertainment  which is an independent Ukrainian studio  created a neo noir third person   shooter video game called My Eyes On You  using motion capture in order to animate its main character  Jordan Adalien  and along with non playable characters             
Out of the three nominees for the      Academy Award for Best Animated Feature  two of the nominees  Monster House and the winner Happy Feet  used motion capture  and only Disney Pixar s Cars was animated without motion capture  In the ending credits of Pixar s film Ratatouille  a stamp appears labelling the film as       Genuine Animation        No Motion Capture  
Since       motion capture has been used extensively to simulate or approximate the look of live action theater  with nearly photorealistic digital character models  The Polar Express used motion capture to allow Tom Hanks to perform as several distinct digital characters  in which he also provided the voices   The      adaptation of the saga Beowulf animated digital characters whose appearances were based in part on the actors who provided their motions and voices  James Cameron s highly popular Avatar used this technique to create the Na vi that inhabit Pandora  The Walt Disney Company has produced Robert Zemeckis s A Christmas Carol using this technique  In       Disney acquired Zemeckis  ImageMovers Digital  that produces motion capture films   but then closed it in       after a box office failure of Mars Needs Moms 
Television series produced entirely with motion capture animation include Laflaque in Canada  Sprookjesboom and Cafe de Wereld           nl      in The Netherlands  and Headcases in the UK 

Movement capture edit 
Virtual reality and augmented reality providers  such as uSens and Gestigon  allow users to interact with digital content in real time by capturing hand motions  This can be useful for training simulations  visual perception tests  or performing virtual walk throughs in a  D environment  Motion capture technology is frequently used in digital puppetry systems to drive computer generated characters in real time 
Gait analysis is one application of motion capture in clinical medicine  Techniques allow clinicians to evaluate human motion across several biomechanical factors  often while streaming this information live into analytical software 
One innovative use is pose detection  which can empower patients during post surgical recovery or rehabilitation after injuries  This approach enables continuous monitoring  real time guidance  and individually tailored programs to enhance patient outcomes             
Some physical therapy clinics utilize motion capture as an objective way to quantify patient progress             
During the filming of James Cameron s Avatar all of the scenes involving motion capture were directed in real time using Autodesk MotionBuilder software to render a screen image which allowed the director and the actor to see what they would look like in the movie  making it easier to direct the movie as it would be seen by the viewer   This method allowed views and angles not possible from a pre rendered animation   Cameron was so proud of his results that he invited Steven Spielberg and George Lucas on set to view the system in action 
In Marvel s The Avengers  Mark Ruffalo used motion capture so he could play his character the Hulk  rather than have him be only CGI as in previous films  making Ruffalo the first actor to play both the human and the Hulk versions of Bruce Banner 
FaceRig software uses facial recognition technology from ULSee Inc to map a player s facial expressions and the body tracking technology from Perception Neuron to map the body movement onto a  D or  D character s motion on screen                         
During Game Developers Conference      in San Francisco Epic Games demonstrated full body motion capture live in Unreal Engine  The whole scene  from the upcoming game Hellblade about a woman warrior named Senua  was rendered in real time  The keynote             was a collaboration between Unreal Engine  Ninja Theory   Lateral  Cubic Motion  IKinema and Xsens 
In       the two time Olympic figure skating champion Yuzuru Hanyu graduated from Waseda University  In his thesis  using data provided by    sensors placed on his body  he analysed his jumps  He evaluated the use of technology both in order to improve the scoring system and to help skaters improve their jumping technique                          In March      a summary of the thesis was published in the academic journal             

Methods and systems edit 
Reflective markers attached to skin to identify body landmarks and the  D motion of body segments
Silhouette tracking
Motion tracking or motion capture started as a photogrammetric analysis tool in biomechanics research in the     s and     s  and expanded into education  training  sports and recently computer animation for television  cinema  and video games as the technology matured  Since the   th century  the performer has to wear markers near each joint to identify the motion by the positions or angles between the markers  Acoustic  inertial  LED  magnetic or reflective markers  or combinations of any of these  are tracked  optimally at least two times the frequency rate of the desired motion  The resolution of the system is important in both the spatial resolution and temporal resolution as motion blur causes almost the same problems as low resolution  Since the beginning of the   st century   and because of the rapid growth of technology   new methods have been developed  Most modern systems can extract the silhouette of the performer from the background  Afterwards all joint angles are calculated by fitting in a mathematical model into the silhouette  For movements you can not see a change of the silhouette  there are hybrid systems available that can do both  marker and silhouette   but with less marker      citation needed      In robotics  some motion capture systems are based on simultaneous localization and mapping

Optical systems edit 
Optical systems utilize data captured from image sensors to triangulate the  D position of a subject between two or more cameras calibrated to provide overlapping projections  Data acquisition is traditionally implemented using special markers attached to an actor  however  more recent systems are able to generate accurate data by tracking surface features identified dynamically for each particular subject  Tracking a large number of performers or expanding the capture area is accomplished by the addition of more cameras  These systems produce data with three degrees of freedom for each marker  and rotational information must be inferred from the relative orientation of three or more markers  for instance shoulder  elbow and wrist markers providing the angle of the elbow  Newer hybrid systems are combining inertial sensors with optical sensors to reduce occlusion  increase the number of users and improve the ability to track without having to manually clean up data             

Passive markers edit 
A dancer wearing a suit used in an optical motion capture system
Markers at specific points on an actor s face during facial optical motion capture
Passive optical systems use markers coated with a retroreflective material to reflect light that is generated near the camera s lens  The camera s threshold can be adjusted so only the bright reflective markers will be sampled  ignoring skin and fabric 
The centroid of the marker is estimated as a position within the two dimensional image that is captured  The grayscale value of each pixel can be used to provide sub pixel accuracy by finding the centroid of the Gaussian 
An object with markers attached at known positions is used to calibrate the cameras and obtain their positions  and the lens distortion of each camera is measured  If two calibrated cameras see a marker  a three dimensional fix can be obtained  Typically a system will consist of around   to    cameras  Systems of over three hundred cameras exist to try to reduce marker swap  Extra cameras are required for full coverage around the capture subject and multiple subjects 
Vendors have constraint software to reduce the problem of marker swapping since all passive markers appear identical  Unlike active marker systems and magnetic systems  passive systems do not require the user to wear wires or electronic equipment              Instead  hundreds of rubber balls are attached with reflective tape  which needs to be replaced periodically  The markers are usually attached directly to the skin  as in biomechanics   or they are velcroed to a performer wearing a full body spandex lycra suit designed specifically for motion capture  This type of system can capture large numbers of markers at frame rates usually around     to     fps although by lowering the resolution and tracking a smaller region of interest they can track as high as        fps 

Active marker edit 
Body motion capture
Active optical systems triangulate positions by illuminating one LED at a time very quickly or multiple LEDs with software to identify them by their relative positions  somewhat akin to celestial navigation  Rather than reflecting light back that is generated externally  the markers themselves are powered to emit their own light  Since the inverse square law provides one quarter of the power at two times the distance  this can increase the distances and volume for capture  This also enables a high signal to noise ratio  resulting in very low marker jitter and a resulting high measurement resolution  often down to          mm within the calibrated volume  
The TV series Stargate SG  produced episodes using an active optical system for the VFX allowing the actor to walk around props that would make motion capture difficult for other non active optical systems      citation needed     
ILM used active markers in Van Helsing to allow capture of Dracula s flying brides on very large sets similar to Weta s use of active markers in Rise of the Planet of the Apes  The power to each marker can be provided sequentially in phase with the capture system providing a unique identification of each marker for a given capture frame at a cost to the resultant frame rate  The ability to identify each marker in this manner is useful in real time applications  The alternative method of identifying markers is to do it algorithmically requiring extra processing of the data 
There are also possibilities to find the position by using colored LED markers  In these systems  each color is assigned to a specific point of the body 
One of the earliest active marker systems in the     s was a hybrid passive active mocap system with rotating mirrors and colored glass reflective markers and which used masked linear array detectors 

Time modulated active marker edit 
A high resolution uniquely identified active marker system with               resolution at     hertz providing real time submillimeter positions
Active marker systems can further be refined by strobing one marker on at a time  or tracking multiple markers over time and modulating the amplitude or pulse width to provide marker ID     megapixel spatial resolution modulated systems show more subtle movements than   megapixel optical systems by having both higher spatial and temporal resolution  Directors can see the actor s performance in real time  and watch the results on the motion capture driven CG character  The unique marker IDs reduce the turnaround  by eliminating marker swapping and providing much cleaner data than other technologies  LEDs with onboard processing and radio synchronization allow motion capture outdoors in direct sunlight while capturing at     to     frames per second due to a high speed electronic shutter  Computer processing of modulated IDs allows less hand cleanup or filtered results for lower operational costs  This higher accuracy and resolution requires more processing than passive technologies  but the additional processing is done at the camera to improve resolution via subpixel or centroid processing  providing both high resolution and high speed  These motion capture systems typically cost         for an eight camera     megapixel spatial resolution     hertz system with one actor 

 IR sensors can compute their location when lit by mobile multi LED emitters  e g  in a moving car  With Id per marker  these sensor tags can be worn under clothing and tracked at     Hz in broad daylight 
Semi passive imperceptible marker edit 
One can reverse the traditional approach based on high speed cameras  Systems such as Prakash use inexpensive multi LED high speed projectors  The specially built multi LED IR projectors optically encode the space  Instead of retro reflective or active light emitting diode  LED  markers  the system uses photosensitive marker tags to decode the optical signals  By attaching tags with photo sensors to scene points  the tags can compute not only their own locations of each point  but also their own orientation  incident illumination  and reflectance 
These tracking tags work in natural lighting conditions and can be imperceptibly embedded in attire or other objects  The system supports an unlimited number of tags in a scene  with each tag uniquely identified to eliminate marker reacquisition issues  Since the system eliminates a high speed camera and the corresponding high speed image stream  it requires significantly lower data bandwidth  The tags also provide incident illumination data which can be used to match scene lighting when inserting synthetic elements  The technique appears ideal for on set motion capture or real time broadcasting of virtual sets but has yet to be proven 

Underwater motion capture system edit 
Motion capture technology has been available for researchers and scientists for a few decades  which has given new insight into many fields 

Underwater cameras edit 
The vital part of the system  the underwater camera  has a waterproof housing  The housing has a finish that withstands corrosion and chlorine which makes it perfect for use in basins and swimming pools  There are two types of cameras  Industrial high speed cameras can also be used as infrared cameras  Infrared underwater cameras come with a cyan light strobe instead of the typical IR light for minimum fall off underwater and high speed cameras with an LED light or with the option of using image processing  Underwater motion capture camera
Motion tracking in swimming by using image processing
Measurement volume edit 
An underwater camera is typically able to measure       meters depending on the water quality  the camera and the type of marker used  Unsurprisingly  the best range is achieved when the water is clear  and like always  the measurement volume is also dependent on the number of cameras  A range of underwater markers are available for different circumstances 

Tailored edit 
Different pools require different mountings and fixtures  Therefore  all underwater motion capture systems are uniquely tailored to suit each specific pool instalment  For cameras placed in the center of the pool  specially designed tripods  using suction cups  are provided 

Markerless edit 
Emerging techniques and research in computer vision are leading to the rapid development of the markerless approach to motion capture  Markerless systems such as those developed at Stanford University  the University of Maryland  MIT  and the Max Planck Institute  do not require subjects to wear special equipment for tracking  Special computer algorithms are designed to allow the system to analyze multiple streams of optical input and identify human forms  breaking them down into constituent parts for tracking  ESC entertainment  a subsidiary of Warner Brothers Pictures created especially to enable virtual cinematography  used a technique called Universal Capture that utilized   camera setup and the tracking the optical flow of all pixels over all the   D planes of the cameras for motion  gesture and facial expression capture leading to photorealistic results 

Traditional systems edit 
Traditionally markerless optical motion tracking is used to keep track of various objects  including airplanes  launch vehicles  missiles and satellites  Many such optical motion tracking applications occur outdoors  requiring differing lens and camera configurations  High resolution images of the target being tracked can thereby provide more information than just motion data  The image obtained from NASA s long range tracking system on the space shuttle Challenger s fatal launch provided crucial evidence about the cause of the accident  Optical tracking systems are also used to identify known spacecraft and space debris despite the fact that it has a disadvantage compared to radar in that the objects must be reflecting or emitting sufficient light             
An optical tracking system typically consists of three subsystems  the optical imaging system  the mechanical tracking platform and the tracking computer 
The optical imaging system is responsible for converting the light from the target area into a digital image that the tracking computer can process  Depending on the design of the optical tracking system  the optical imaging system can vary from as simple as a standard digital camera to as specialized as an astronomical telescope on the top of a mountain  The specification of the optical imaging system determines the upper limit of the effective range of the tracking system 
The mechanical tracking platform holds the optical imaging system and is responsible for manipulating the optical imaging system in such a way that it always points to the target being tracked  The dynamics of the mechanical tracking platform combined with the optical imaging system determines the tracking system s ability to keep the lock on a target that changes speed rapidly 
The tracking computer is responsible for capturing the images from the optical imaging system  analyzing the image to extract the target position and controlling the mechanical tracking platform to follow the target  There are several challenges  First  the tracking computer has to be able to capture the image at a relatively high frame rate  This posts a requirement on the bandwidth of the image capturing hardware  The second challenge is that the image processing software has to be able to extract the target image from its background and calculate its position  Several textbook image processing algorithms are designed for this task  This problem can be simplified if the tracking system can expect certain characteristics that is common in all the targets it will track  The next problem down the line is controlling the tracking platform to follow the target  This is a typical control system design problem rather than a challenge  which involves modeling the system dynamics and designing controllers to control it  This will however become a challenge if the tracking platform the system has to work with is not designed for real time 
The software that runs such systems is also customized for the corresponding hardware components  One example of such software is OpticTracker  which controls computerized telescopes to track moving objects at great distances  such as planes and satellites  Another option is the software SimiShape  which can also be used hybrid in combination with markers 

RGB D cameras edit 
RGB D cameras such as Kinect capture both the color and depth images  By fusing the two images   D colored voxels can be captured  allowing motion capture of  D human motion and human surface in real time 
Because of the use of a single view camera  motions captured are usually noisy  Machine learning techniques have been proposed to automatically reconstruct such noisy motions into higher quality ones  using methods such as lazy learning             and Gaussian models              Such method generates accurate enough motion for serious applications like ergonomic assessment             

Non optical systems edit 
Inertial systems edit 
Inertial motion capture             technology is based on miniature inertial sensors  biomechanical models and sensor fusion algorithms              The motion data of the inertial sensors  inertial guidance system  is often transmitted wirelessly to a computer  where the motion is recorded or viewed  Most inertial systems use inertial measurement units  IMUs  containing a combination of gyroscope  magnetometer  and accelerometer  to measure rotational rates  These rotations are translated to a skeleton in the software  Much like optical markers  the more IMU sensors the more natural the data  No external cameras  emitters or markers are needed for relative motions  although they are required to give the absolute position of the user if desired  Inertial motion capture systems capture the full six degrees of freedom body motion of a human in real time and can give limited direction information if they include a magnetic bearing sensor  although these are much lower resolution and susceptible to electromagnetic noise  Benefits of using Inertial systems include  capturing in a variety of environments including tight spaces  no solving  portability  and large capture areas  Disadvantages include lower positional accuracy and positional drift which can compound over time  These systems are similar to the Wii controllers but are more sensitive and have greater resolution and update rates  They can accurately measure the direction to the ground to within a degree  The popularity of inertial systems is rising amongst game developers              mainly because of the quick and easy setup resulting in a fast pipeline  A range of suits are now available from various manufacturers and base prices range from       to US        

Mechanical motion edit 
Mechanical motion capture systems directly track body joint angles and are often referred to as exoskeleton motion capture systems  due to the way the sensors are attached to the body  A performer attaches the skeletal like structure to their body and as they move so do the articulated mechanical parts  measuring the performer s relative motion  Mechanical motion capture systems are real time  relatively low cost  free from occlusion  and wireless  untethered  systems that have unlimited capture volume  Typically  they are rigid structures of jointed  straight metal or plastic rods linked together with potentiometers that articulate at the joints of the body  These suits tend to be in the         to         range plus an external absolute positioning system  Some suits provide limited force feedback or haptic input 

Magnetic systems edit 
Main article  Positional tracking        Magnetic tracking
Magnetic systems calculate position and orientation by the relative magnetic flux of three orthogonal coils on both the transmitter and each receiver              The relative intensity of the voltage or current of the three coils allows these systems to calculate both range and orientation by meticulously mapping the tracking volume  The sensor output is six degrees of freedom   DOF   which provides useful results obtained with two thirds the number of markers required in optical systems  one on upper arm and one on lower arm for elbow position and angle      citation needed      The markers are vulnerable to magnetic and electrical interference from metal objects in the environment  like rebar  steel reinforcing bars in concrete  or wiring  which affect the magnetic field  and electrical sources such as monitors  lights  cables and computers 
The sensor response is nonlinear  especially toward edges of the capture area  The wiring from the sensors tends to preclude extreme performance movements              With magnetic systems  it is possible to monitor the results of a motion capture session in real time              The capture volumes for magnetic systems are dramatically smaller than they are for optical systems  With the magnetic systems  there is a distinction between alternating current  AC  and direct current  DC  systems  DC system uses square pulses  AC systems use sine waves 

Stretch sensors edit 
Stretch sensors are flexible parallel plate capacitors that measure either stretch  bend  shear  or pressure and are typically produced from silicone  When the sensor stretches or squeezes its capacitance value changes  This data can be transmitted via Bluetooth or direct input and used to detect minute changes in body motion  Stretch sensors are unaffected by magnetic interference and are free from occlusion  The stretchable nature of the sensors also means they do not suffer from positional drift  which is common with inertial systems  Stretchable sensors  on the other hands  due to the material properties of their substrates and conducting materials  suffer from relatively low signal to noise ratio  requiring filtering or machine learning to make them usable for motion capture  These solutions result in higher latency when compared to alternative sensors 

Related techniques edit 
Facial motion capture edit 
Main article  Facial motion capture
Most traditional motion capture hardware vendors provide for some type of low resolution facial capture utilizing anywhere from    to     markers with either an active or passive marker system  All of these solutions are limited by the time it takes to apply the markers  calibrate the positions and process the data  Ultimately the technology also limits their resolution and raw output quality levels 
High fidelity facial motion capture  also known as performance capture  is the next generation of fidelity and is utilized to record the more complex movements in a human face in order to capture higher degrees of emotion  Facial capture is currently arranging itself in several distinct camps  including traditional motion capture data  blend shaped based solutions  capturing the actual topology of an actor s face  and proprietary systems 
The two main techniques are stationary systems with an array of cameras capturing the facial expressions from multiple angles and using software such as the stereo mesh solver from OpenCV to create a  D surface mesh  or to use light arrays as well to calculate the surface normals from the variance in brightness as the light source  camera position or both are changed  These techniques tend to be only limited in feature resolution by the camera resolution  apparent object size and number of cameras  If the users face is    percent of the working area of the camera and a camera has megapixel resolution  then sub millimeter facial motions can be detected by comparing frames  Recent work is focusing on increasing the frame rates and doing optical flow to allow the motions to be retargeted to other computer generated faces  rather than just making a  D Mesh of the actor and their expressions 

Radio frequency positioning edit 
Radio frequency positioning systems are becoming more viable     citation needed      as higher frequency radio frequency devices allow greater precision than older technologies such as radar  The speed of light is    centimeters per nanosecond  billionth of a second   so a    gigahertz  billion cycles per second  radio frequency signal enables an accuracy of about   centimeters  By measuring amplitude to a quarter wavelength  it is possible to improve the resolution down to about        mm  To achieve the resolution of optical systems  frequencies of    gigahertz or higher are needed  which are almost as dependent on line of sight and as easy to block as optical systems  Multipath and reradiation of the signal are likely to cause additional problems  but these technologies will be ideal for tracking larger volumes with reasonable accuracy  since the required resolution at     meter distances is not likely to be as high  Many scientists     who       believe that radio frequency will never produce the accuracy required for motion capture 
Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers said in      that they had made a system that tracks motion by radio frequency signals

An alternative approach was developed where the actor is given an unlimited walking area through the use of a rotating sphere  similar to a hamster ball  which contains internal sensors recording the angular movements  removing the need for external cameras and other equipment  Even though this technology could potentially lead to much lower costs for motion capture  the basic sphere is only capable of recording a single continuous direction  Additional sensors worn on the person would be needed to record anything more 
Another alternative is using a  DOF  Degrees of freedom  motion platform with an integrated omni directional treadmill with high resolution optical motion capture to achieve the same effect  The captured person can walk in an unlimited area  negotiating different uneven terrains  Applications include medical rehabilitation for balance training  bio mechanical research and virtual reality      citation needed     

 D pose estimation edit 
In  D pose estimation  an actor s pose can be reconstructed from an image or depth map
