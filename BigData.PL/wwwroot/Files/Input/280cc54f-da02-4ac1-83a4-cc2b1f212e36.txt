In August       when President Mohamed Morsi became the first Egyptian leader to visit Iran since the     s  he was careful not to schedule meetings with the Iranian leadership  much less to endorse any renewal of diplomatic relations between Egypt and Iran 
Since then  a return to the level of cooperation pe
r status quo ante has been progressing at warp speed  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Cairo on   February with the intention of renewing the diplomatic relationship which existed before the      revolution  While attending a conference of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation hosted here  he also promised to lift visa requirements for Egyptian tourists and businessmen 
These overtures are already bearing fruit  At the time of writing  a delegation of Egyptian officials has just flown to Tehran to implement a       Mubarak era  agreement for weekly flights between Egypt and Iran 
So what could come out of a strategic cooperation between Egypt and Iran  While the US  in its wisdom  just sent the Morsi regime another     Abrams tanks and    more American F   s  the Egyptian people  living on the equivalent of    per day  are more dependent on imported wheat than many other countries in the world 
Yes  it is the best of times  it is the worst of times  and no doubt the sum of all these strategic overtures is to scare the hell out of Israel  Regrettably they seem to be doing nothing to deliver bread  freedom  or justice to the people of Egypt or Iran 
The Ahmadinejad regime  likewise  is known for a history of unconscionable repression and threats not only to the state of Israel but also to its own people  This mentality has borne the same bitter harvest for a generation  which has known only poverty and unrest in both countries  and in Iran  geopolitical isolation 
In order to understand what is attracting Cairo to Tehran  it is essential to realise that the Egyptian alliance with America was never about respect  Rather  it has always been a marriage of convenience between America s need to buy an ally in the region  and the Mubarak regime s need for military arms to secure its own longevity 
When the Mubarak era ended  as all regimes based on force inevitably do  it was inevitable that the tide of anti Israeli feeling which had been dammed up for a generation behind the wall of American largesse would break out in the virulent hatred which masquerades under the name of Islam 
The problem is  Demagogues are very good at achieving political power by appealing to nationalistic feelings  scapegoating outsiders and creating boogy men  Fostering economic opportunity  honouring individual liberty  respecting dissenting voices  this is a different skill set altogether  And so now the whole world has a problem  It s obvious that the West cannot buy enough Egyptian good will and cannot punish Iran with sanctions enough to keep them from reaching out to each other 
The attraction between Iran and Egypt is  partly  that both regimes used to share a mutual debt to Marx much more than to our Prophet Muhammad  As a matter of historical fact  the Khomeini revolution was supported by communist French parties  Likewise  the Socialist International has solid support among Iranian university students 
Iran itself is backed by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation  The Iraqi Shi a leader Sistani does not support the Wilayat al faqih system in Iran  and it is a fact clear to everyone that Mawdudi  the father of that ideology  was inspired by Marx  This vanguard Stalinist idea is an approach common in communist countries  and seeks to turn the control of the central government over society into a sort of bourgeoisie 
In sum  the revolution of       and the so called  Islamic  Republic of Iran which came of it  is actually a Marxist government which is irreconcilable with Shi a Islam or any form of government discernible in the Quran  Therefore  the  Islamic  name of the Iranian revolution is in conflict with the true nature of the revolution 
Any association between a repressive Marxist regime such as that which rules Iran and the embryonic democracy which is trying to implant itself on the banks of the Nile can only prove deleterious to the pregnancy 
The next thing to be considered is the structure of the Islamic Republic of Iran  There is a pervasive totalitarian pressure on Iranian society and the authority of the military over civilians is visible  as it is the case in all other Marxist structures  This could have an undesirable effect on Egypt  which has been trying to shake off the lingering effect of vast military control over society 
Some political analysts think that the military should go back to controlling civilian society  while others think that this option should not even be considered  I cannot safely say that I feel the military has stopped exerting influence over society  given the fact that they still own more than     of the economic entities in the country 
By the same token  if Egypt would engage in a strategic partnership with Turkey  rather than Iran  it would approach the model for which liberals have been longing  under conditions in which Egyptians would enjoy a more liberated lifestyle and secure their religious liberties  and in which Egyptian industry  economy  and society are likely to prosper
