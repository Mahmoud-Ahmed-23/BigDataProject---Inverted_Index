Platform expansion edit

For system level integration outside of the Allo app and Google Nest  the Google Assistant was initially exclusive to the Google Pixel smartphones              In February       Google announced that it had begun to enable access to the Assistant on Android smartphones running Android       or      beginning in select English speaking markets                          Android tablets did not receive the Assistant as part of this rollout                          The Assistant is also integrated in Wear OS                  and will be included in future versions of Android TV                         and Android Auto              In October       the Google Pixelbook became the first laptop to include Google Assistant              Google Assistant later came to the Google Pixel Buds              In December       Google announced that the Assistant would be released for phones running Android     through an update to Google Play Services  as well as tablets running     Marshmallow and     Nougat              In February       Google reportedly began testing ads in Google Assistant results             
On May           Android Police reported that the Google Assistant would be coming to the iOS operating system as a separate app              The information was confirmed two days later at Google s developer conference                         

Smart displays edit 
In January      at the Consumer Electronics Show  the first Assistant powered  smart displays  were released              Smart displays were shown at the event from Lenovo  Sony  JBL and LG              These devices have support for Google Duo video calls  YouTube videos  GMaps directions  a GCalendar agenda  viewing of smart camera footage  in addition to services which work with Google Home devices            
These devices are based on Android Things and Google developed software  Google unveiled its own smart display  Google Nest Hub in October       and later Google Nest Hub Max  which utilizes a different system platform             

Developer support edit 
In December       Google launched  Actions on Google   a developer platform for the Google Assistant  Actions on Google allows  rd party developers to build apps for Google Assistant                          In March       Google added new tools for developing on Actions on Google to support the creation of games for Google Assistant              Originally limited to the Google Nest smart speaker  Actions on Google was made available to Android and iOS devices in May                               at which time Google also introduced an app directory or application directory for overview of compatible products and services              To incentivize developers to build Actions  Google announced a competition  in which first place won tickets to Google s      developer conference           and a walk through of Google s campus  while second place and third place received        and         respectively  and a Google Home             
In April       a software development kit  SDK  was released  allowing third party developers to build their own hardware that can run the Google Assistant                          It has been integrated into Raspberry Pi                          cars from Audi and Volvo                          and Home automation appliances  including fridges  washers  and ovens  from companies including iRobot  LG  General Electric  and D Link                                      Google updated the SDK in December      to add several features that only the Google Home smart speakers and Google Assistant smartphone apps had previously supported             
The features include 

Third party device makers can incorporate their own  Actions on Google  commands for their respective products
Text based interactions and many languages
Users can set a precise geographic location for the device to enable improved location specific queries                         
On May          Google announced a new program that focuses on investing in the future of Google Assistant through early stage startups  Their focus was to build an environment where developers could build richer experiences for their users  This includes startups that broaden Assistant s features  are building new hardware devices  or simply differentiating in different industries             

Voices edit 
Google Assistant launched using the voice of Kiki Baessell for the American female voice  the same actress for the Google Voice voicemail system since                  
On October           Google announced that Issa Rae had been added to Google Assistant as an optional voice  which could be enabled by the user by saying  Okay  Google  talk like Issa               Although  as of April       Google Assistant response with  Sorry  that voice isn t available anymore  but you can try out another by asking me to change voices   if the command is given      citation needed     

Interaction edit 
The Google Assistant on the Google Pixel XL phone
Google Assistant  in the nature and manner of Google Now  can search the Internet  schedule events and alarms  adjust hardware settings on the user s device  and show information from the user s Google account  Unlike Google Now  however  the Assistant can engage in a two way conversation  using Google s natural language processing algorithm  Search results are presented in a card format that users can tap to open the page              In February       Google announced that users of Google Home would be able to shop entirely by voice for products through its Google Express shopping service  with products available from Whole Foods Market  Costco  Walgreens  PetSmart  and Bed Bath  amp  Beyond at launch                          and other retailers added in the following months as new partnerships were formed                          Google Assistant can maintain a shopping list  this was previously done within the notetaking service GKeep  but the feature was moved to Google Express and the Google Home app in April       resulting in a severe loss of functionality                         
In May       Google announced that the Assistant would support a keyboard for typed input and visual responses                          support identifying objects and gather visual information through the device s camera                          and support purchasing products                         and sending money                          Through the use of the keyboard  users can see a history of queries made to the Google Assistant  and edit or delete previous inputs  The Assistant warns against deleting  however  due to its use of previous inputs to generate better answers in the future              In November       it became possible to identify songs currently playing by asking the Assistant                         
The Google Assistant allows users to activate and modify vocal shortcut commands in order to perform actions on their device  both Android and iPad iPhone  or configure it as a hub for home automation 
This feature of the speech recognition is available in English  among other languages                          In July       the Google Home version of Assistant gained support for multiple actions triggered by a single vocal shortcut command             
At the annual I O developers conference on May          Google s SEO announced the addition of six new voice options for the Google Assistant  one of which being John Legend s              This was made possible by WaveNet  a voice synthesizer developed by DeepMind  which significantly reduced the amount of audio samples that a voice actor was required to produce for creating a voice model              However  John Legend s Google Assistant cameo voice was discontinued on March                                  
In August       Google added bilingual capabilities to the Google Assistant for existing supported languages on devices  Recent reports say that it may support multilingual support by setting a third default language on Android Phone             
Speech to Text can recognize commas  question marks  and periods in transcription requests             
In April       the most popular audio games in the Assistant  Crystal Ball  and Lucky Trivia  have had the biggest voice changes in the application s history  The voice in the assistant has been able to add expression to the games  For instance  in the Crystal Ball game  the voice would speak slowly and softly during the intro and before the answer is revealed to make the game more exciting  and in the Lucky Trivia game  the voice would become excitable like a game show host  In the British accent voice of Crystal Ball  the voice would say the word  probably  in a downward slide like she s not too sure  The games used the text to speech voice which makes the voice more robotic  In May      however  it turned out to be a bug in the speech API that caused the games to lose the studio quality voices  These audio games were fixed in May      

Interpreter Mode edit 
On December           Google debuted an interpreter mode in Google Assistant smartphone apps for Android and iOS  It provides translation of conversations in real time and was previously only available on Google Home smart speakers and displays              Google Assistant won the      Webby Award for Best User Experience in the category  Apps  Mobile  amp  Voice             
On March          Google introduced a feature on Google Assistant that read webpages aloud in    languages                         
On October           Google announced a new  hum to search  function to find a song by simply humming  whistling  or singing the song                         

Google Duplex edit 
This section is about Duplex for Google Assistant  For the number  see googolplex 
In May       Google revealed Duplex  an extension of the Google Assistant that allows it to carry out natural conversations by mimicking human voice  in a manner not dissimilar to robocalling              The assistant can autonomously complete tasks such as calling a hair salon to book an appointment  scheduling a restaurant reservation  or calling businesses to verify holiday store hours              While Duplex can complete most of its tasks fully autonomously  it is able to recognize situations that it is unable to complete and can signal a human operator to finish the task  Duplex was created to speak in a more natural voice and language by incorporating speech disfluencies such as filler words like  hmm  and  uh  and using common phrases such as  mhm  and  gotcha   along with more human like intonation and response latency                                      Duplex is currently in development and had a limited release in late      for Google Pixel users              During the limited release  Pixel phone users in Atlanta  New York  Phoenix  and San Francisco were only able to use Duplex to make restaurant reservations              As of October       Google has expanded Duplex to businesses in eight countries                         

Criticism edit 
After the announcement  concerns were made over the ethical and societal questions that artificial intelligence technology such as Duplex raises              For instance  human operators may not notice that they are speaking with a digital robot when conversing with Duplex              which some critics view as unethical or deceitful              Concerns over privacy were also identified  as conversations with Duplex are recorded in order for the virtual assistant to analyze and respond              Privacy advocates have also raised concerns around how the millions of vocal samples gathered from consumers are fed back into the algorithms of virtual assistants  making these forms of AI smarter with each use  Though these features individualize the user experience  critics are unsure about the long term implications of giving  the company unprecedented access to human patterns and preferences that are crucial to the next phase of artificial intelligence               
While transparency was referred to as a key part to the experience when the technology was revealed               Google later further clarified in a statement saying   We are designing this feature with disclosure built in  and we ll make sure the system is appropriately identified                            Google further added that  in certain jurisdictions  the assistant would inform those on the other end of the phone that the call is being recorded              

Reception edit 
PC World s Mark Hachman gave a favorable review of the Google Assistant  saying that it was a  step up on Cortana and Siri                Digital Trends called it  smarter than Google Now ever was               

Criticism edit 
In July      Belgian public broadcaster VRT NWS published an article revealing that third party contractors paid to transcribe audio clips collected by Google Assistant listened to sensitive information about users  Sensitive data collected from Google Home devices and Android phones included names  addresses  and other private conversations after mistaken hot word triggering  such as business calls or bedroom conversations               From more than       recordings analyzed      were recorded without the  OK Google  command  Google officially acknowledged that      of recordings are being listened to by language experts to improve Google s services               On August          Germany s Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information initiated an administrative procedure to prohibit Google from carrying out corresponding evaluations by employees or third parties for the period of three months to provisionally protect the rights of privacy of data subjects for the time being  citing GDPR               A Google spokesperson stated that Google paused  language reviews  in all European countries while it investigated recent media leaks
