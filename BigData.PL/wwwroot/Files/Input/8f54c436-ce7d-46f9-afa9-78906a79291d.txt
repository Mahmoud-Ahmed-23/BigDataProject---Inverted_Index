A literary trope is an artistic effect realized with figurative language   word  phrase  image   such as a rhetorical figure             In editorial practice  a trope is  a substitution of a word or phrase by a less literal word or phrase              Semantic change has expanded the definition of the literary term trope to also describe a writer s usage of commonly recurring or overused literary techniques and rhetorical devices  characters and situations                                    motifs  and clich s in a work of creative literature                       


Origins edit 
The term trope derives from the Greek         tropos    a turn  a change              related to the root of the verb          trepein    to turn  to direct  to alter  to change              this means that the term is used metaphorically to denote  among other things  metaphorical language  Tropes and their classification were an important field in classical rhetoric  The study of tropes has been taken up again in modern criticism  especially in deconstruction             Tropological criticism  not to be confused with tropological reading  a type of biblical exegesis  is the historical study of tropes  which aims to  define the dominant tropes of an epoch  and to  find those tropes in literary and non literary texts   an interdisciplinary investigation of which Michel Foucault was an  important exemplar             

In medieval writing edit 
A specialized use is the medieval amplification of texts from the liturgy  such as in the Kyrie Eleison  Kyrie    magnae Deus potentia    liberator hominis    transgressoris mandati    eleison   The most important example of such a trope is the Quem quaeritis   an amplification before the Introit of the Easter Sunday service and the source for liturgical drama                         This particular practice came to an end with the Tridentine Mass  the unification of the liturgy in      promulgated by Pope Pius V            

Types and examples edit 
Rhetoricians have analyzed a variety of  twists and turns  used in poetry and literature and have provided a list of labels for these poetic devices  These include

Animorphism    The fictional trope of a human transforming into an animal  in a bid to overcome challenges 
Analogy   A comparison by showing how two seemingly different entities are alike  along with illustrating a larger point due to their commonalities                                     
Emphasis   The use of an expression or term in a narrower and more precise sense than usual to accentuate a certain sense                                     
Hyperbole   The use of exaggeration to create a strong impression 
Irony   Creating a trope through implying the opposite of the standard meaning  such as describing a bad situation as  good times  
Litotes   A figure of speech and form of verbal irony in which understatement is used to emphasize a point by stating a negative to further affirm a positive  often incorporating double negatives for effect 
Metaphor   An explanation of an object or idea through juxtaposition of disparate things with a similar characteristic  such as describing a courageous person as having a  heart of a lion  
Allegory   A sustained metaphor continued through whole sentences or even through a whole discourse  For example   The ship of state has sailed through rougher storms than the tempest of these lobbyists  
Catachresis   A metaphor that is or can be a stretch for an audience to catch on to  Catachreses can be subjective  some people may find a metaphor to be too much while others may find it perfectly reasonable            
Metonymy   A trope through proximity or correspondence  For example  referring to actions of the U S  president as  actions of the White House  
Antonomasia   A kind of metonymy in which an epithet or phrase takes the place of a proper name 
Simile   A form of speech that draws an explicit comparison  in contrast to metaphors  of one thing and another using the words  as  or  like  to bring vividness to its description 
Synecdoche   A literary device  related to metonymy and metaphor  which creates a play on words by referring to something with a related concept  For example  referring to the whole with the name of a part  such as  hired hands  for workers  a part with the name of the whole  such as  the law  for police officers  the general with the specific  such as  bread  for food  the specific with the general  such as  cat  for a lion  or an object with its substance  such as  bricks and mortar  for a building 
Oxymoron    The use of two opposite situations or things in one sentence to prove a point            
Pun or paronomasia   A form of word play that exploits multiple meanings of a term  or of similar sounding words 
Antanaclasis   The stylistic trope of repeating a single word  but with a different meaning each time  antanaclasis is a common type of pun  and like other kinds of pun  it is often found in slogans 
For a longer list  see Figure of speech  Tropes 
Kenneth Burke has called metaphor  metonymy  synecdoche and irony the  four master tropes              owing to their frequency in everyday discourse 
These tropes can be used to represent common recurring themes throughout creative works  and in a modern setting relationships and character interactions  It can also be used to denote examples of common repeating figures of speech and situations             
Whilst most of the various forms of phrasing described above are in common usage  most of the terms themselves are not  in particular antanaclasis  litotes  metonymy  synecdoche and catachresis      citation needed
