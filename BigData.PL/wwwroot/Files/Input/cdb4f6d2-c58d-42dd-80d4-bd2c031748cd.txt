Incorrect or misleading information
Not to be confused with Disinformation or Misinformation effect 
A sign campaigning for the successful Vote Leave in the      United Kingdom European Union membership referendum  The claim made by the sign was widely considered to have been an example of misinformation                                             
Misinformation is incorrect or misleading information                        Misinformation and disinformation are not interchangeable terms  misinformation can exist with or without specific malicious intent  whereas disinformation is distinct in that the information is deliberately deceptive and propagated                                                           Misinformation can include inaccurate  incomplete  misleading  or false information as well as selective or half truths  
In January       the World Economic Forum identified misinformation and disinformation  propagated by both internal and external interests  to  widen societal and political divides  as the most severe global risks in the short term              The reason is that misinformation can influence people s beliefs about communities  politics  medicine  and more                          Research shows that susceptibility to misinformation can be influenced by several factors  including cognitive biases  emotional responses  social dynamics  and media literacy levels  
Accusations of misinformation have been used to curb legitimate journalism and political dissent             
The term came into wider recognition during the mid     s through the early     s  when its effects on public ideological influence began to be investigated  However  misinformation campaigns have existed for hundreds of years                         


Terminology edit 
Scholars distinguish between misinformation  disinformation  and malinformation in terms of intent and effect  Misinformation is false or inaccurate information published without malicious intent  while disinformation is designed to mislead              
Malinformation is correct information used in the wrong or harmful context  for instance  selectively publishing personal details to influence public opinion             
Disinformation is created or spread by a person or organization actively attempting to deceive their audience              In addition to causing harm directly  disinformation can also cause indirect harm by undermining trust and obstructing the capacity to effectively communicate information with one another              Disinformation might consist of information that is partially or completely fabricated  taken out of context on purpose  exaggerated  or omits crucial details              Disinformation can appear in any medium including text  audio  and imagery              The distinction between mis  and dis information can be muddy because the intent of someone sharing false information can be difficult to discern 
Misinformation is information that was originally thought to be true but was later discovered not to be true  and often applies to emerging situations in which there is a lack of verifiable information or changing scientific understanding              For example  the scientific guidance around infant sleep positions has evolved over time              and these changes could be a source of confusion for new parents  Misinformation can also often be observed as news events are unfolding and questionable or unverified information fills information gaps  Even if later retracted  false information can continue to influence actions and memory             
Rumors are unverified information not attributed to any particular source and may be either true or false             
Definitions of these terms may vary between cultural contexts             

History edit 
Early examples include the insults and smears spread among political rivals in Imperial and Renaissance Italy in the form of pasquinades              These are anonymous and witty verses named for the Pasquino piazza and talking statues in Rome  In pre revolutionary France   canards   or printed broadsides  sometimes included an engraving to convince readers to take them seriously      citation needed     
During the summer of       continental Europe anxiously awaited news as the Spanish Armada sailed to fight the English  The Spanish postmaster and Spanish agents in Rome promoted reports of Spanish victory in hopes of convincing Pope Sixtus V to release his promised one million ducats upon landing of troops  In France  the Spanish and English ambassadors promoted contradictory narratives in the press  and a Spanish victory was incorrectly celebrated in Paris  Prague  and Venice  It was not until late August that reliable reports of the Spanish defeat arrived in major cities and were widely believed  the remains of the fleet returned home in the autumn             
Misinformation has historically been linked to advancements in communications technologies  With the mass media revolution in the   th century  television  radio  and newspapers were major vehicles for reliable information and misinformation 
             War time propaganda  political disinformation  and corporate public relations operations often shaped the public perception  occasionally distorting facts to promote economic or ideological agendas              With the discovery of television as a popular medium  disinformation could be rapidly disseminated to millions of individuals  reinforcing existing bias and making correction more difficult              These early trends set the foundation for modern digital misinformation  which now spreads even more efficiently along internet networks

The first recorded large scale disinformation campaign was the Great Moon Hoax  published in      in the New York The Sun  in which a series of articles claimed to describe life on the Moon   complete with illustrations of humanoid bat creatures and bearded blue unicorns               The challenges of mass producing news on a short deadline can lead to factual errors and mistakes  An example of such is the Chicago Tribune     s infamous      headline  Dewey Defeats Truman              
Social media platforms allow for easy spread of misinformation  Post election surveys in      suggest that many individuals who intake false information on social media believe them to be factual              The specific reasons why misinformation spreads through social media so easily remain unknown  A      study of Twitter determined that  compared to accurate information  false information spread significantly faster  further  deeper  and more broadly              Similarly  a research study of Facebook found that misinformation was more likely to be clicked on than factual information      citation needed

Moreover  the advent of the Internet has changed traditional ways that misinformation spreads              During the      United States presidential election  content from websites deemed  untrustworthy  reached up to     of Americans  despite misinformation making up only    of overall news media              Misinformation has been spread during many health crises                          For example  misinformation about alternative treatments was spread during the Ebola outbreak in                                    During the COVID    pandemic  the proliferation of mis  and dis information was exacerbated by a general lack of health literacy             

Research edit 
See also  Disinformation research
Much research on how to correct misinformation has focused on fact checking              However  this can be challenging because the information deficit model does not necessarily apply well to beliefs in misinformation                          Various researchers have also investigated what makes people susceptible to misinformation              People may be more prone to believe misinformation because they are emotionally connected to what they are listening to or are reading  Social media has made information readily available to society at anytime  and it connects vast groups of people along with their information at one time              Advances in technology have impacted the way people communicate information and the way misinformation is spread              Today  social media platforms are a very popular way of receiving information and staying up to date  with over     of people relying on it             

Causes edit 
Factors that contribute to beliefs in misinformation are an ongoing subject of study               According to Scheufele and Krause  misinformation belief has roots at the individual  group and societal levels              At the individual level  individuals have varying levels of skill in recognizing mis  or dis information and may be predisposed to certain misinformation beliefs due to other personal beliefs  motivations  or emotions              However  evidence for the hypotheses that believers in misinformation use more cognitive heuristics and less effortful processing of information have produced mixed results                                      At the group level  in group bias and a tendency to associate with like minded or similar people can produce echo chambers and information silos that can create and reinforce misinformation beliefs                          At the societal level  public figures like politicians and celebrities can disproportionately influence public opinions  as can mass media outlets              In addition  societal trends like political polarization  economic inequalities  declining trust in science  and changing perceptions of authority contribute to the impact of misinformation             
Disinformation has evolved and grown over the years  with the advent of online platforms  which facilitate the speed of transmission  Research indicates there is evidence to demonstrate that misinformation circulates at a faster rate than accurate facts  and to some degree due to the emotional and sensationalized presentation of the lie              Social media ease of sharing simply makes the problem worse  making there be the prevalence of believing false stories even after they are debunked              It causes political polarization  public misconceptions  and weakening trust in traditional media             

Historically  people have relied on journalists and other information professionals to relay facts              As the number and variety of information sources has increased  it has become more challenging for the general public to assess their credibility              This growth of consumer choice when it comes to news media allows the consumer to choose a news source that may align with their biases  which consequently increases the likelihood that they are misinformed                  of Americans reported social media as their main news source in      as opposed to traditional news sources              Polling shows that Americans trust mass media at record low rates              and that US young adults place similar levels of trust in information from social media and from national news organizations              The pace of the    hour news cycle does not always allow for adequate fact checking  potentially leading to the spread of misinformation              Further  the distinction between opinion and reporting can be unclear to viewers or readers                         
Sources of misinformation can appear highly convincing and similar to trusted legitimate sources              For example  misinformation cited with hyperlinks has been found to increase readers  trust  Trust is even higher when these hyperlinks are to scientific journals  and higher still when readers do not click on the sources to investigate for themselves                          Research has also shown that the presence of relevant images alongside incorrect statements increases both their believability and shareability  even if the images do not actually provide evidence for the statements                          For example  a false statement about macadamia nuts accompanied by an image of a bowl of macadamia nuts tends to be rated as more believable than the same statement without an image             
The translation of scientific research into popular reporting can also lead to confusion if it flattens nuance  sensationalizes the findings  or places too much emphasis on weaker levels of evidence  For instance  researchers have found that newspapers are more likely than scientific journals to cover observational studies and studies with weaker methodologies              Dramatic headlines may gain readers  attention  but they do not always accurately reflect scientific findings             
Human cognitive tendencies can also be a contributing factor to misinformation belief  One study found that an individual s recollection of political events could be altered when presented with misinformation about the event  even when primed to identify warning signs of misinformation              Misinformation may also be appealing by seeming novel or incorporating existing stereotypes             

Identification edit 
Research has yielded a number of strategies that can be employed to identify misinformation  many of which share common features  Although a common recommendation is to use common sense             and check whether the source or sharers of the information might be biased or have an agenda  this is not always a reliable strategy              Readers tend to distinguish between unintentional misinformation and uncertain evidence from politically or financially motivated misinformation              The perception of misinformation depends on the political spectrum  with right wing readers more concerned with attempts to hide reality              It can be difficult to undo the effects of misinformation once individuals believe it to be true              Individuals may desire to reach a certain conclusion  causing them to accept information that supports that conclusion  and are more likely to retain and share information if it emotionally resonates with them             
The SIFT Method  also called the Four Moves  is one commonly taught method of distinguishing between reliable and unreliable information              This method instructs readers to first Stop and begin to ask themselves about what they are reading or viewing   do they know the source and if it is reliable  Second  readers should Investigate the source  What is the source s relevant expertise and do they have an agenda  Third  a reader should Find better coverage and look for reliable coverage on the claim at hand to understand if there is a consensus around the issue  Finally  a reader should Trace claims  quotes  or media to their original context  has important information been omitted  or is the original source questionable 
Visual misinformation presents particular challenges  but there are some effective strategies for identification              Misleading graphs and charts can be identified through careful examination of the data presentation  for example  truncated axes or poor color choices can cause confusion              Reverse image searching can reveal whether images have been taken out of their original context              There are currently some somewhat reliable ways to identify AI generated imagery                          but it is likely that this will become more difficult to identify as the technology advances                         
A person s formal education level and media literacy do correlate with their ability to recognize misinformation                          People who are familiar with a topic  the processes of researching and presenting information  or have critical evaluation skills are more likely to correctly identify misinformation  However  these are not always direct relationships  Higher overall literacy does not always lead to improved ability to detect misinformation              Context clues can also significantly impact people s ability to detect misinformation             
Martin Libicki  author of Conquest In Cyberspace  National Security and Information Warfare              notes that readers should aim to be skeptical but not cynical  Readers should not be gullible  believing everything they read without question  but also should not be paranoid that everything they see or read is false 

Factors influencing susceptibility to misinformation edit 
Various demographic  cognitive  social  and technological factors can influence an individual s susceptibility to misinformation  This section examines how age  political ideology  and algorithms may affect vulnerability to false or misleading information 

Age edit 
Research suggests that age can be a significant factor in how individuals process and respond to misinformation  Some researchers have suggested that older individuals are more susceptible to misinformation than younger individuals due to cognitive decline              Other studies have found that  while this may be a factor  the issue is more complex than simply aging and experiencing cognitive decline  One notable area where cognitive decline is prevalent is repeated exposure to misinformation  A study found that older adults are more likely than younger adults to believe misinformation after repeated exposure  known as the illusory truth effect              This is linked to declines in memory and analytical reasoning  which can make it more challenging for older adults to distinguish between true and false information             
A      review about age and misinformation concludes that social change contributes to older adults  susceptibility to misinformation  Older adults  social networks shrink  and they are more trusting of friends and family  This trust can be misplaced  however  as friends and family may share inaccurate or misleading information online  but older adults may assume it is true because it is shared by someone they trust  Research also indicates that older adults are more vulnerable to deception than younger adults  This can make them especially vulnerable to online content that is clickbait or seeks to deceive people             
Another commonly found explanation for older adults  susceptibility to misinformation is a lack of digital literacy  According to a nationally representative study of U S  adults by Pew Research Center from           of adults aged    years or older own a smartphone      use social media  and     own a tablet computer  All three numbers represent an increase over the last decade  indicating that older adults are spending more time online  thereby increasing their potential exposure to misinformation              Research indicates that older adults often struggle to identify internet hoaxes and distinguish between advertorial and editorial content              This exposes older adults to more fringe news sources  complicating the issue of correcting misinformed beliefs 
These factors have contributed to older adults sharing more misinformation than other demographics  a trend that may increase as the American population ages             

Political ideology and confirmation bias edit 
Political ideology can significantly shape how individuals encounter  process  and respond to misinformation  with implications for both information consumption patterns and cognitive processing 
Research from      suggests that motivated reasoning  or confirmation bias the tendency to accept information that supports pre existing beliefs while rejecting contradictory views influences information processing  regardless of political affiliation             
This cognitive bias fosters an environment where misinformation that aligns with one s view thrives  creating echo chambers  Researchers explored the relationship between partisanship  the presence of an echo chamber  and vulnerability to misinformation  finding a strong correlation between right wing partisanship and the sharing of online misinformation              They also discovered a similar trend among left leaning users  Similar research has found that right  and left wing partisans exhibit similar levels of metacognitive awareness  which refers to individuals  conscious awareness of their own thoughts and mental processes              In a study that asked participants to identify news headlines as true or false  both Democrats and Republicans admitted to occasionally suspecting they were wrong             
Researchers also examined the relationship between ideological extremity and susceptibility to misinformation  finding that ideological extremity on both sides of the political spectrum predicts greater receptivity to misinformation              This finding  coupled with confirmation bias  contributes to a media ecosystem where misinformation can thrive 

Algorithms edit 
Social media algorithms are designed to increase user engagement              Research suggests that humans are naturally drawn to emotionally charged content  and algorithms perpetuate a cycle in which emotionally charged misinformation is disproportionately promoted on social media platforms              This misinformation is spread rapidly through algorithms  outpacing the speed of fact checking             
Additionally  most social media users possess a limited understanding of how algorithms curate their information feeds              This knowledge gap makes it difficult for users to recognize potential biases on their social media feeds or to implement strategies to diversify the content they are exposed to  In response  some researchers and organizations call for modifications to algorithmic systems to help reduce the amplification of misinformation             

AI contribution to the problem and aid in combatting edit 
Artificial intelligence exacerbates the problem of misinformation but also contributes to the fight against misinformation 

Deepfakes and Synthetic media create very convincing visual  audio  and textual evidence that is difficult to distinguish from legitimate authoritative evidence             
Internet bots and automated Internet trolls can rapidly sow disinformation              
Algorithmic bias plays a role in amplification of sensational and controversial material regardless of truth              
Countermeasures edit 
See also  Conspiracy theories        Interventions
Factors that contribute to the effectiveness of a corrective message include an individual s mental model or worldview  repeated exposure to the misinformation  time between misinformation and correction  credibility of the sources  and relative coherency of the misinformation and corrective message  Corrective messages will be more effective when they are coherent and or consistent with the audience s worldview  They will be less effective when misinformation is believed to come from a credible source  is repeated prior to correction  even if the repetition occurs in the process of debunking   and or when there is a time lag between the misinformation exposure and corrective message  Additionally  corrective messages delivered by the original source of the misinformation tend to be more effective               However  misinformation research has often been criticized for its emphasis on efficacy  i e   demonstrating effects of interventions in controlled experiments  over effectiveness  i e   confirming real world impacts of these interventions                Critics argue that while laboratory settings may show promising results  these do not always translate into practical  everyday situations where misinformation spreads               Research has identified several major challenges in this field  an overabundance of lab research and a lack of field studies  the presence of testing effects that impede intervention longevity and scalability  modest effects for small fractions of relevant audiences  reliance on item evaluation tasks as primary efficacy measures  low replicability in the Global South and a lack of audience tailored interventions  and the underappreciation of potential unintended consequences of intervention implementation              

Fact checking and debunking edit 
Websites have been created to help people to discern fact from fiction  For example  the site FactCheck org aims to fact check the media  especially viral political stories  The site also includes a forum where people can openly ask questions about the information               Similar sites allow individuals to copy and paste misinformation into a search engine and the site will investigate it               Some sites exist to address misinformation about specific topics  such as climate change misinformation  DeSmog  formerly The DeSmogBlog  publishes factually accurate information in order to counter the well funded disinformation campaigns spread by motivated deniers of climate change  Science Feedback  focuses on evaluating science  health  climate  and energy claims in the media and providing an evidence based analysis of their veracity              
Flagging or eliminating false statements in media using algorithmic fact checkers is becoming an increasingly common tactic to fight misinformation  Google and many social media platforms have added automatic fact checking programs to their sites and created the option for users to flag information that they think is false               Google provides supplemental information pointing to fact checking websites in search results for controversial topics  On Facebook  algorithms may warn users if what they are about to share is likely false              In some cases social media platforms  efforts to curb the spread of misinformation has resulted in controversy  drawing criticism from people who see these efforts as constructing a barrier to their right to expression              

One on one correction edit 
Within the context of personal interactions  some strategies for debunking have the potential to be effective  Simply delivering facts is frequently ineffective because misinformation belief is often not the result of a deficit of accurate information              although individuals may be more likely to change their beliefs in response to information shared by someone with whom they have close social ties  like a friend or family member               More effective strategies focus on instilling doubt and encouraging people to examine the roots of their beliefs               In these situations  tone can also play a role  expressing empathy and understanding can keep communication channels open  It is important to remember that beliefs are driven not just by facts but by emotion  worldview  intuition  social pressure  and many other factors             

Social correction edit 
Fact checking and debunking can be done in one on one interactions  but when this occurs on social media it is likely that other people may encounter and read the interaction  potentially learning new information from it or examining their own beliefs  This type of correction has been termed social correction               Researchers have identified three ways to increase the efficacy of these social corrections for observers               First  corrections should include a link to a credible source of relevant information  like an expert organization  Second  the correct information should be repeated  for example at the beginning and end of the comment or response  Third  an alternative explanation should be offered  An effective social correction in response to a statement that chili peppers can cure COVID    might look something like   Hot peppers in your food  though very tasty  cannot prevent or cure COVID     The best way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is to keep at least   meter away from others and to wash your hands frequently and thoroughly  Adding peppers to your soup won t prevent or cure COVID     Learn more from the WHO                Interestingly  while the tone of the correction may impact how the target of the correction receives the message and can increase engagement with a message               it is less likely to affect how others seeing the correction perceive its accuracy              
While social correction has the potential to reach a wider audience with correct information  it can also potentially amplify an original post containing misinformation              

Prebunking edit 
Misinformation typically spreads more readily than fact checking                                       Further  even if misinformation is corrected  that does not mean it is forgotten or does not influence people s thoughts              Another approach  called prebunking  aims to  inoculate  against misinformation by showing people examples of misinformation and how it works before they encounter it                            While prebunking can involve fact based correction  it focuses more on identifying common logical fallacies  e g   emotional appeals to manipulate individuals  perceptions and judgments               false dichotomies  or ad hominem fallacies               and tactics used to spread misinformation as well as common misinformation sources               Research about the efficacy of prebunking has shown promising results              

Other interventions edit 
A report by the Royal Society in the UK lists additional potential or proposed countermeasures              

Automated detection systems  e g  to flag or add context and resources to content 
Provenance enhancing technology  i e  better enabling people to determine the veracity of a claim  image  or video 
APIs for research  i e  for usage to detect  understand  and counter misinformation 
Active bystanders  e g  corrective commenting 
Community moderation  usually of unpaid and untrained  often independent  volunteers 
Anti virals  e g  limiting the number of times a message can be forwarded in privacy respecting encrypted chats 
Collective intelligence  examples being Wikipedia where multiple editors refine encyclopedic articles  and question and answer sites where outputs are also evaluated by others similar to peer review 
Trustworthy institutions and data
Media literacy  increasing citizens  ability to use ICTs to find  evaluate  create  and communicate information  an essential skill for citizens of all ages 
Media literacy is taught in Estonian public schools   from kindergarten through to high school   since      and  accepted  as important as       writing or reading               
New Jersey mandated K    students to learn information literacy             
 Inoculation  via educational videos shown to adults is being explored             
Broadly described  the report recommends building resilience to scientific misinformation and a healthy online information environment and not having offending content removed  It cautions that censorship could e g  drive misinformation and associated communities  to harder to address corners of the internet               
Online misinformation about climate change can be counteracted through different measures at different stages               Prior to misinformation exposure  education and  inoculation  are proposed  Technological solutions  such as early detection of bots and ranking and selection algorithms are suggested as ongoing mechanisms  Post misinformation  corrective and collaborator messaging can be used to counter climate change misinformation  Incorporating fines and similar consequences has also been suggested 
The International Panel on the Information Environment was launched in      as a consortium of over     scientists working to develop effective countermeasures to misinformation and other problems created by perverse incentives in organizations disseminating information via the Internet              
There also is research and development of platform built in as well as browser integrated  currently in the form of addons  misinformation mitigation                                                      This includes quality neutrality reliability ratings for news sources  Wikipedia s perennial sources page categorizes many large news sources by reliability               Researchers have also demonstrated the feasibility of falsity scores for popular and official figures by developing such for over     contemporary elites on Twitter as well as associated exposure scores                           
Strategies that may be more effective for lasting correction of false beliefs include focusing on intermediaries  such as convincing activists or politicians who are credible to the people who hold false beliefs  or promoting intermediaries who have the same identities or worldviews as the intended audience   minimizing the association of misinformation with political or group identities  such as providing corrections from nonpartisan experts  or avoiding false balance based on partisanship in news coverage   and emphasizing corrections that are hard for people to avoid or deny  such as providing information that the economy is unusually strong or weak  or describing the increased occurrence of extreme weather events in response to climate change denial               

AI as a tool to combat misinformation edit 
Fact checking algorithms are employed to fact check truth claims in real time              
Researchers are developing AI tools for detecting fabricated audio and video              
AI can be used for Information literacy and Media literacy education              
Limitations edit 
Main article  Belief perseverance
Interventions need to account for the possibility that misinformation can persist in the population even after corrections are published  Possible reasons include difficulty in reaching the right people and corrections not having long term effects                            For example  if corrective information is only published in science focused publications and fact checking websites  it may not reach the people who believe in misinformation since they are less likely to read those sources  In addition  successful corrections may not be persistent  particularly if people are re exposed to misinformation at a later date              
It has been suggested that directly countering misinformation can be counterproductive  which is referred to as a  backfire effect   but in practice this is very rare                                                      A      review of the scientific literature on backfire effects found that there have been widespread failures to replicate their existence  even under conditions that would be theoretically favorable to observing them               Due to the lack of reproducibility  as of          update      most researchers believe that backfire effects are either unlikely to occur on the broader population level  or they only occur in very specific circumstances  or they do not exist               Brendan Nyhan  one of the researchers who initially proposed the occurrence of backfire effects  wrote in      that the persistence of misinformation is most likely due to other factors               For most people  corrections and fact checking are very unlikely to have a negative impact  and there is no specific group of people in which backfire effects have been consistently observed               In many cases  when backfire effects have been discussed by the media or by bloggers  they have been overgeneralized from studies on specific subgroups to incorrectly conclude that backfire effects apply to the entire population and to all attempts at correction                           
There is an ongoing debate on whether misinformation interventions may have the negative side effect of reducing belief in both false and true information  regardless of veracity               For instance  one study found that inoculation and accuracy primes to some extent undermined users  ability to distinguish implausible from plausible conspiracy theories               Other scholars have shown through simulations that even if interventions reduce both the belief in false and true information  the effect on the media ecosystem may still be favorable due to different base rates in both beliefs              

Online misinformation edit 
Further information  Health information on the Internet        Social media
In recent years  the proliferation of misinformation online has drawn widespread attention               More than half of the world s population had access to the Internet in the beginning of                    Digital and social media can contribute to the spread of misinformation   for instance  when users share information without first checking the legitimacy of the information they have found  People are more likely to encounter online information based on personalized algorithms               Google  Facebook and Yahoo News all generate newsfeeds based on the information they know about our devices  our location  and our online interests              
Although two people can search for the same thing at the same time  they are very likely to get different results based on what that platform deems relevant to their interests  fact or false               Various social media platforms have recently been criticized for encouraging the spread of false information  such as hoaxes  false news  and mistruths               It is responsible with influencing people s attitudes and judgment during significant events by disseminating widely believed misinformation               Furthermore  online misinformation can occur in numerous ways  including rumors  urban legends  factoids  etc               However  the underlying factor is that it contains misleading or inaccurate information              
Moreover  users of social media platforms may experience intensely negative feelings  perplexity  and worry as a result of the spread of false information               According to a recent study  one in ten Americans has gone through mental or emotional stress as a result of misleading information posted online               Spreading false information can also seriously impede the effective and efficient use of the information available on social media               An emerging trend in the online information environment is  a shift away from public discourse to private  more ephemeral  messaging   which is a challenge to counter misinformation              

On social media edit 
Pew Research reports shared that approximately one in four American adults admitted to sharing misinformation on their social media platforms              
In the Information Age  social networking sites have become a notable agent for the spread of misinformation  fake news  and propaganda                                                                  Social media sites have changed their algorithms to prevent the spread of fake news but the problem still exists              
Image posts are the biggest spread of misinformation on social media  a fact which is grossly unrepresented in research  This leads to a  yawning gap of knowledge  as there is a collective ignorance on how harmful image based posts are compared to other types of misinformation              

Spread edit 
Social media platforms allow for easy spread of misinformation               The specific reasons why misinformation spreads through social media so easily remain unknown              
Agent based models and other computational models have been used by researchers to explain how false beliefs spread through networks  Epistemic network analysis is one example of a computational method for evaluating connections in data shared in a social media network or similar network              
Researchers fear that misinformation in social media is  becoming unstoppable                It has also been observed that misinformation and disinformation reappear on social media sites      citation needed     
Misinformation spread by bots has been difficult for social media platforms to address               Sites such as Facebook have algorithms that have been proven to further the spread of misinformation in which how content is spread among subgroups              

Social causes and echo chambers edit 
Spontaneous spread of misinformation on social media usually occurs from users sharing posts from friends or mutually followed pages               These posts are often shared from someone the sharer believes they can trust               Misinformation introduced through a social format influences individuals drastically more than misinformation delivered non socially              
People are inclined to follow or support like minded individuals  creating echo chambers and filter bubbles               Untruths or general agreement within isolated social clusters are difficult to counter               Some argue this causes an absence of a collective reality               Research has also shown that viral misinformation may spread more widely as a result of echo chambers  as the echo chambers provide an initial seed which can fuel broader viral diffusion              
Misinformation might be created and spread with malicious intent for reasons such as causing anxiety or deceiving audiences               Computational Propaganda actors benefit from both disinformation and misinformation               Rumors created with or without malicious intent may be unknowingly shared by users      citation needed      People may know what the scientific community has proved as a fact  and still refuse to accept it as such              

Lack of regulation edit 
Misinformation on social media spreads quickly in comparison to traditional media because of the lack of regulation and examination required before posting                           
Social media sites provide users with the capability to spread information quickly to other users without requiring the permission of a gatekeeper such as an editor  who might otherwise require confirmation of the truth before allowing publication                           
The problem of misinformation in social media is getting worse as younger generations prefer social media over journalistic for their source of information              

Lack of peer review edit 
Promoting more Peer Review to benefit the accuracy in information
Due to the decentralized nature and structure of the Internet  content creators can easily publish content without being required to undergo peer review  prove their qualifications  or provide backup documentation  While library books have generally been reviewed and edited by an editor  publishing company  etc   Internet sources cannot be assumed to be vetted by anyone other than their authors  Misinformation may be produced  reproduced  and posted immediately on most online platforms                           

Countermeasures edit 
Combating the spread of misinformation on social medias is difficult for reasons such as       

the profusion of misinformation sources makes the reader s task of weighing the reliability of information more challenging             
social media s propensity for culture wars embeds misinformation with identity based conflict            
the proliferation of echo chambers form an epistemic environment in which participants encounter beliefs and opinions that coincide with their own               moving the entire group toward more extreme positions                          
With the large audiences that can be reached and the experts on various subjects on social media  some believe social media could also be the key to correcting misinformation              
Journalists today are criticized for helping to spread false information on these social platforms  but research shows they also play a role in curbing it through debunking and denying false rumors                           

COVID    misinformation edit 
Main article  COVID    misinformation
During the COVID    Pandemic  social media was used as one of the main propagators for spreading misinformation about symptoms  treatments  and long term health related problems             This problem has initialized a significant effort in developing automated detection methods for misinformation on social media platforms            
The creator of the Stop Mandatory Vaccination made money posting anti vax false news on social media  He posted more than     posts aimed towards women  garnering a total of          million views and earning money for every click and share              

Misinformation on TikTok edit 
A research report by NewsGuard found there is a very high level       in their probes of videos about relevant topics  of online misinformation delivered   to a mainly young user base   with TikTok  whose  essentially unregulated  usage is increasing as of                                

Misinformation on Facebook edit 
Main article  Misinformation on Facebook
A research study of Facebook found that misinformation was more likely to be clicked on than factual information                The most common reasons that Facebook users were sharing misinformation for socially motivated reasons  rather than taking the information seriously              
Facebook s coverage of misinformation has become a hot topic with the spread of COVID     as some reports indicated Facebook recommended pages containing health misinformation               For example  this can be seen when a user likes an anti vax Facebook page  Automatically  more and more anti vax pages are recommended to the user               Additionally  some reference Facebook s inconsistent censorship of misinformation leading to deaths from COVID                 
Facebook estimated the existence of up to         million troll bots actively spreading misinformation on their platform               and has taken measures to stop the spread of misinformation  resulting in a decrease  though misinformation continues to exist on the platform               On Facebook  adults older than    were seven times more likely to share fake news than adults ages                    

Misinformation on Twitter edit 
Main articles  Twitter under Elon Musk        Misinformation and disinformation  and Community Notes
Twitter is one of the most concentrated platforms for engagement with political fake news      of fake news sources are shared by      of users  who are  super sharers   Older  more conservative social users are also more likely to interact with fake news               Another source of misinformation on Twitter are bot accounts  especially surrounding climate change               Bot accounts on Twitter accelerate true and fake news at the same rate               A      study of Twitter determined that  compared to accurate information  false information spread significantly faster  further  deeper  and more broadly               A research study watched the process of thirteen rumors appearing on Twitter and noticed that eleven of those same stories resurfaced multiple times  after time had passed              
A social media app called Parler has caused much chaos as well  Right winged Twitter users who were banned on the app moved to Parler after the January   United States Capitol attack  and the app was being used to plan and facilitate more illegal and dangerous activities  Google and Apple later pulled the app off their respective app stores  This app has been able to cause a lot of misinformation and bias in the media  allowing for more political mishaps              

Misinformation on YouTube edit 
This section is an excerpt from Social impact of YouTube   False scientific content  edit 
Anti intellectual beliefs flourish on YouTube  One well publicized example is the network of content creators supporting the view that the Earth is flat  not a sphere                            Researchers found that the YouTubers publishing  Flat Earth  content aim to polarize their audiences through arguments that build upon an anti scientific narrative              
A study published in July      concluded that most climate change related videos support worldviews that are opposed to the scientific consensus on climate change               Though YouTube claimed in December      that new recommendation policies reduced  borderline  recommendations by      a January      Avaaz study found that  for videos retrieved by the search terms  climate change    global warming   and  climate manipulation   YouTube s  up next  sidebar presented videos containing information contradicting the scientific consensus         and     of the time  respectively               Avaaz argued that this  misinformation rabbit hole  means YouTube helps to spread climate denialism  and profits from it              
In November       YouTube issued a one week suspension of the account of One America News Network and permanently de monetized its videos because of OANN s repeated violations of YouTube s policy prohibiting videos claiming sham cures for COVID                  Without evidence  OANN also cast doubt on the validity of the      U S  presidential election              
On August          YouTube barred Sky News Australia from uploading new content for a week for breaking YouTube s rules on spreading COVID    misinformation               In September       more than a year after YouTube said it would take down misinformation about the coronavirus vaccines  the accounts of six out of twelve anti vaccine activists identified by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate were still searchable and still posting videos               

In October       YouTube s owner Google announced it would no longer permit YouTube creators to earn advertising money for content that  contradicts well established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change   and that it will not allow ads that promote such views               In spite of this policy  many videos that included misinformation about climate change were not de monetized               Earlier  climate change deniers  online YouTube content focused on denying global warming  or saying such warming isn t caused by humans burning fossil fuel               As such denials became untenable  using new tactics that evade YouTube s policies to combat misinformation  content shifted to asserting that climate solutions are not workable  saying global warming is harmless or even beneficial  and accusing the environmental movement of being unreliable              
Noteworthy examples edit 
An example of bad information from media sources that led to the spread of misinformation occurred in November       when Chris Hansen on Dateline NBC claimed that law enforcement officials estimate        predators are online at any moment  Afterward  the U S  attorney general at the time  Alberto Gonzales  repeated the claim  However  the number that Hansen used in his reporting had no backing  Hansen said he received the information from Dateline expert Ken Lanning  but Lanning admitted that he made up the number        because there was no solid data on the number  According to Lanning  he used        because it sounds like a real number  not too big and not too small  and referred to it as a  Goldilocks number   Reporter Carl Bialik says that the number        is used often in the media to estimate numbers when reporters are unsure of the exact data              
During the COVID    pandemic  a conspiracy theory that COVID    was linked to the  G network gained significant traction worldwide after emerging on social media              
Misinformation was a major talking point during the      U S  presidential election with claims of social media sites allowing  fake news  to be spread              

Impact edit 
The Liar s Dividend describes a situation in which individuals are so concerned about realistic misinformation  in particular  deepfakes  that they begin to mistrust real content  particularly if someone claims that it is false               For instance  a politician could benefit from claiming that a real video of them doing something embarrassing was actually AI generated or altered  leading followers to mistrust something that was actually real  On a larger scale this problem can lead to erosion in the public s trust of generally reliable information sources              
Misinformation can affect all aspects of life  Allcott  Gentzkow  and Yu concur that the diffusion of misinformation through social media is a potential threat to democracy and broader society  The effects of misinformation can lead to decline of accuracy of information as well as event details               When eavesdropping on conversations  one can gather facts that may not always be true  or the receiver may hear the message incorrectly and spread the information to others  On the Internet  one can read content that is stated to be factual but that may not have been checked or may be erroneous  In the news  companies may emphasize the speed at which they receive and send information but may not always be correct in the facts  These developments contribute to the way misinformation may continue to complicate the public s understanding of issues and to serve as a source for belief and attitude formation              
In regard to politics  some view being a misinformed citizen as worse than being an uninformed citizen  Misinformed citizens can state their beliefs and opinions with confidence and thus affect elections and policies  This type of misinformation occurs when a speaker appears  authoritative and legitimate   while also spreading misinformation               When information is presented as vague  ambiguous  sarcastic  or partial  receivers are forced to piece the information together and make assumptions about what is correct               Misinformation has the power to sway public elections and referendums if it gains enough momentum  Leading up to the      UK European Union membership referendum  for example  a figure used prominently by the Vote Leave campaign claimed that by leaving the EU the UK would save      million a week   for the NHS   Claims then circulated widely in the campaign that this amount would  rather than could theoretically  be redistributed to the British National Health Service after Brexit  This was later deemed a  clear misuse of official statistics  by the UK statistics authority 
Moreover  the advert infamously shown on the side of London s double decker busses did not take into account the UK s budget rebate  and the idea that      of the money saved would go to the NHS was unrealistic  A poll published in      by Ipsos MORI found that nearly half of the British public believed this misinformation to be true               Even when information is proven to be misinformation  it may continue to shape attitudes towards a given topic               meaning it has the power to swing political decisions if it gains enough traction  A study conducted by Soroush Vosoughi  Deb Roy and Sinan Aral looked at Twitter data including         posts spread by   million people over     million times  They found that political news traveled faster than any other type of information  They found that false news about politics reached more than        people three times faster than all other types of false news              
Aside from political propaganda  misinformation can also be employed in industrial propaganda  Using tools such as advertising  a company can undermine reliable evidence or influence belief through a concerted misinformation campaign  For instance  tobacco companies employed misinformation in the second half of the twentieth century to diminish the reliability of studies that demonstrated the link between smoking and lung cancer              
In the medical field  misinformation can immediately lead to life endangerment as seen in the case of the public s negative perception towards vaccines or the use of herbs instead of medicines to treat diseases                            In regards to the COVID    pandemic  the spread of misinformation has proven to cause confusion as well as negative emotions such as anxiety and fear                            Misinformation regarding proper safety measures for the prevention of the virus that go against information from legitimate institutions like the World Health Organization can also lead to inadequate protection and possibly place individuals at risk for exposure                           
Some scholars and activists are heading movements to eliminate the mis disinformation and information pollution in the digital world  One theory   information environmentalism   has become a curriculum in some universities and colleges                            The general study of misinformation and disinformation is by now also common across various academic disciplines  including sociology  communication  computer science  and political science  leading to the emerging field being described loosely as  Misinformation and Disinformation Studies                However  various scholars and journalists have criticised this development  pointing to problematic normative assumptions  a varying quality of output and lack of methodological rigor  as well as a too strong impact of mis  and disinformation research in shaping public opinion and policymaking                            Summarising the most frequent points of critique  communication scholars Chico Camargo and Felix Simon wrote in an article for the Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review that  mis  disinformation studies has been accused of lacking clear definitions  having a simplified understanding of what it studies  a too great emphasis on media effects  a neglect of intersectional factors  an outsized influence of funding bodies and policymakers on the research agenda of the field  and an outsized impact of the field on policy and policymaking

Social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter have found themselves defending accusations of censorship for removing posts they have deemed to be misinformation  Social media censorship policies relying on government agency issued guidance to determine information validity have garnered criticism that such policies have the unintended effect of stifling dissent and criticism of government positions and policies               Most recently  social media companies have faced criticism over allegedly prematurely censoring the discussion of the SARS CoV   Lab Leak Hypothesis                           
Other accusations of censorship appear to stem from attempts to prevent social media consumers from self harm through the use of unproven COVID    treatments  For example  in July       a video went viral showing Dr  Stella Immanuel claiming hydroxychloroquine was an effective cure for COVID     In the video  Immanuel suggested that there was no need for masks  school closures  or any kind of economic shut down  attesting that her alleged cure was highly effective in treating those infected with the virus  The video was shared         times and received nearly    million views on Facebook before it was taken down for violating community guidelines on spreading misinformation               The video was also taken down on Twitter overnight  but not before former president Donald Trump shared it to his page  which was followed by over    million Twitter users  NIAID director Dr  Anthony Fauci and members of the World Health Organization  WHO  quickly discredited the video  citing larger scale studies of hydroxychloroquine showing it is not an effective treatment of COVID     and the FDA cautioned against using it to treat COVID    patients following evidence of serious heart problems arising in patients who have taken the drug              
Another prominent example of misinformation removal criticized by some as an example of censorship was the New York Post     s report on the Hunter Biden laptops approximately two weeks before the      presidential election  which was used to promote the Biden Ukraine conspiracy theory  Social media companies quickly removed this report  and the Post s Twitter account was temporarily suspended  Over    intelligence officials found the disclosure of emails allegedly belonging to Joe Biden s son had all the  classic earmarks of a Russian information operation                Later evidence emerged that at least some of the laptop s contents were authentic
