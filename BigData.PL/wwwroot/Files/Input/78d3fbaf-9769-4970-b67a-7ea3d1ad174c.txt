Turing s Cathedral edit 
Turing s Cathedral is Dyson s fourth book  Though Alan Turing is in the title  the book focuses on John von Neumann and his      attempt to build a computer at Princeton s Institute for Advanced Study  known as the IAS machine  MANIAC I was the same machine later built at Los Alamos Laboratory   Dyson interviewed several people who knew von Neumann  including his father  Freeman Dyson  The book received mostly positive reviews                         Brian E  Blank noted in his review   e xtensive biographical and institutional backgrounds   and concludes it with             


It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Turing s Cathedral is an idiosyncratic  undisciplined  crazy quilt of a book  The reviewer had no preconceived notions about the sort of book that might be authored by a man who once lived for three years in a treehouse    feet above the ground  but the eccentricities of Turing s Cathedral do not seem inconsistent with what might be imagined  And yet  for all its flaws  shortcomings  and waywardness  it is a book that amply rewards its readers
