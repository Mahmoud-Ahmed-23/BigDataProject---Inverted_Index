In statistics  the conditional probability table  CPT  is defined for a set of discrete and mutually dependent random variables to display conditional probabilities of a single variable with respect to the others  i e   the probability of each possible value of one variable if we know the values taken on by the other variables   For example  assume there are three random variables

 with k and j ranging over K values  create a K K matrix  This matrix is a stochastic matrix since the columns sum to    i e

      displaystyle  sum   k T  kj    
  
 for all j  For example  suppose that two binary variables x and y have the joint probability distribution given in this table

Each of the four central cells shows the probability of a particular combination of x and y values  The first column sum is the probability that x    and y equals any of the values it can have   that is  the column sum     is the marginal probability that x    If we want to find the probability that y   given that x    we compute the fraction of the probabilities in the x   column that have the value y    which is                  Likewise  in the same column we find that the probability that y   given that x   is                  In the same way  we can also find the conditional probabilities for y equalling   or   given that x    Combining these pieces of information gives us this table of conditional probabilities for y

With more than one conditioning variable  the table would still have one row for each potential value of the variable whose conditional probabilities are to be given  and there would be one column for each possible combination of values of the conditioning variables  
Moreover  the number of columns in the table could be substantially expanded to display the probabilities of the variable of interest conditional on specific values of only some  rather than all  of the other variables
