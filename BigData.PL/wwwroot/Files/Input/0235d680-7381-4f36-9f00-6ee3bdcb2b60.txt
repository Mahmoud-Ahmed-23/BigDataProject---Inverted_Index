							The International Monetary Fund  IMF  and Egypt reached a staff level agreement to unlock the second tranche of the    bn  three year loan programme  the Washington based fund said in a press release on Friday 
 The IMF staff team and the Egyptian authorities have reached a staff level agreement on the first review of Egypt s economic reform programme supported by the IMF s    bn arrangement   the IMF said 
The statement followed a visit by an IMF team last week to conduct a review of Egypt s reform efforts to decide when the next      bn would be disbursed 
 The staff level agreement is subject to approval by the IMF s executive board  Completion of the review would make available about      bn  bringing total disbursements under the programme to about   bn   it added 
Last November  the IMF clinched a deal with Egyptian authorities on a three year loan programme and paid out      bn of the first   bn tranche of the loan 
Egypt s Central Bank Governor  Tarek Amer  said that the deal is a new vote of confidence in the local economy 
 This deal is telling foreign investors that we are taking the right steps to revive the economy   Amer told state run MENA news agency 
 We are expecting more foreign inflows  which could spur growth and development   he added 
The IMF described the agreement as a  testimony to the great efforts the government and the Central Bank of Egypt  CBE  have been making to reform the economy  
 The authorities  economic reform process is off to a good start   it confirmed 
 The liberalisation of the exchange rate  as well as the introduction of a value added tax and continuing with energy subsidy reform to strengthen the fiscal position  have all had significant effects  Foreign exchange shortages are resolved  and interbank market activity is recovering  
Egypt  which floated its currency last November  introduced a series of austerity measures  including tightening fiscal policies  reducing subsidies  and raising taxes 
The fund also said it supports the CBE s objective to bring down the rate of inflation to single digits over the medium term consistent with its price stability mandate 
 We are confident that the central bank has the tools to achieve this  
The IMF called on the CBE to raise interest rates as a means to tame the rising inflation 
Egypt s inflation extended its rally in April  standing at       year on year  y o y   the highest in almost    years  according to official data released on Wednesday 
On    April  IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said at a press conference that Egyptian policymakers need to put special focus on inflation 
Following Lagarde s statements  IMF s director for the Middle East and Central Asia  Jihad Azour  said in a press conference that  interest rates are the right instrument to manage Egypt s inflation  
 The authorities see reducing inflation as a key priority for safeguarding the welfare of people across Egypt  We support the CBE s objective  
 Egypt has regained investors  confidence  as shown in the great appetite for Egypt s Eurobond sale in January       and private sector remittances and portfolio investments have increased considerably  
The IMF also said that the manufacturing sector key for job creation is witnessing a strong rebound  while exports have increased significantly
