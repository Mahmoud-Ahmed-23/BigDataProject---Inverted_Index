Artist  architect and pioneer Ramses Wissa Wasef is one of Egypt s leading humanists  He came from a family dedicated to the patronage of the arts  His father was a nationalist at a time of turmoil for Egypt under British rule  and Wassef was drawn heavily into the beauty of old Cairo and the architecture of its medieval times 
To mark his centennial  the Tarek Waly Centre has joined forces with the Supreme Council of Culture and the American University in Cairo s rare books library to celebrate the artist s life  through an exhibition that will be held at the palace of the arts  part of the Cairo Opera House complex 
The exhibition hopes to bring attention to both Wassef s work and his life  In addition to showcasing works that are in the AUC s rare books library  the exhibition will also screen a    minute documentary film that features the lives of those touched by Wassef  The film is titled Ayub Al Haraneya and is directed by both Tarek Waly and Omnia Khalil 
The Tarek Waly Centre for architecture and heritage is naturally interested in Wassef s work and they describe their own vision as including  cultural continuity  and holding it vital to architectural and urban practices  For the Waly Center  culture is given a prominent role in architecture and its passing from generation to generation 
This vision compliments Wassef s work beautifully  and the artist famously drew inspiration from the ability of craftsmen to create beauty from their heritage and their own local character  Admiring and promoting Egyptian local work  Wassef drew attention to these practices 
Somewhat of an aesthete  he stressed beauty of form in everything he admired and created  Wassef also famously criticised modern society and its focus on adhering to certain norms and frameworks in art  He spoke of the importance of individualism in art and of the place of art as a universal value and a universal language of communication 
In       he founded  along with his wife Sophie  the Ramses Wissa Wassef Art Centre compound near Giza  to train local craftsmen  The centre has trained generations upon generations of weavers and other craftsmen and continues to operate to this day  Wassef taught architecture and art at the College of Fine Arts in Cairo and chaired the department of architecture until his death in      
The exhibition will be inaugurated on   November  and will run to    November  with the screening of the documentary film and a series of talks organised by the Tarek Waly Centre
