History edit 
ProPublica was the brainchild of Herbert and Marion Sandler  the former chief executives of the Golden West Financial Corporation  who have committed     million a year to the project              The Sandlers hired Paul Steiger  former managing editor of the Wall Street Journal  to create and run the organization as editor in chief 
At the time ProPublica was set up  Steiger responded to concerns about the role of the left leaning political views of the Sandlers  saying on the Newshour with Jim Lehrer 

Coming into this  when I talked to Herb and Marion Sandler  one of my concerns was precisely this question of independence and nonpartisanship     My history has been doing  down the middle  reporting  And so when I talked to Herb and Marion I said   Are you comfortable with that   They said   Absolutely   I said   Well  suppose we did an expos  of some of the left leaning organizations that you have supported or that are friendly to what you ve supported in the past   They said   No problem   And when we set up our organizational structure  the board of directors  on which I sit and of which Herb is the chairman  does not know in advance what we re going to report on             
ProPublica had an initial news staff of    reporters and editors              including Pulitzer Prize winners Charles Ornstein  Tracy Weber  Jeff Gerth  and Marcus Stern  Steiger was reported to have received     applications             upon ProPublica s announcement  The organization appointed a    member advisory board of professional journalists
