Anthropic PBC is an American artificial intelligence  AI  startup company founded in       Anthropic has developed a family of large language models  LLMs  named Claude as a competitor to OpenAI s ChatGPT and Google s Gemini             According to the company  it researches and develops AI to  study their safety properties at the technological frontier  and use this research to deploy safe models for the public                       
Anthropic was founded by former members of OpenAI  including siblings Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei             In September       Amazon announced an investment of up to    billion  followed by a    billion commitment from Google in the following month                                    


History edit 
Dario Amodei  co founder
Founding and early development             edit 
Anthropic was founded in      by seven former employees of OpenAI  including siblings Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei  the latter of whom served as OpenAI s Vice President of Research                         
In April       Anthropic announced it had received      million in funding              including a      million investment from FTX under the leadership of Sam Bankman Fried                        
In the summer of       Anthropic finished training the first version of Claude but did not release it  mentioning the need for further internal safety testing and the desire to avoid initiating a potentially hazardous race to develop increasingly powerful AI systems             

Legal and strategic partnerships        edit 
In February       Anthropic was sued by Texas based Anthrop LLC for the use of its registered trademark  Anthropic A I               On September           Amazon announced a partnership with Anthropic  with Amazon becoming a minority stakeholder by initially investing       billion  and planning a total investment of    billion             As part of the deal  Anthropic would use Amazon Web Services  AWS  as its primary cloud provider and make its AI models available to AWS customers                         The next month  Google invested      million in Anthropic  and committed to an additional      billion over time             

Major investments and acquisitions        edit 
In March       Amazon maxed out its potential investment from the agreement made in the prior year by investing another US      billion into Anthropic  completing its    billion investment             
In November       Amazon announced a new investment of    billion in Anthropic  bringing its total investment to    billion   including an agreement to increase the use of Amazon s AI chips for training and running Anthropic s large language models             
In       Anthropic attracted several notable employees from OpenAI  including Jan Leike  John Schulman  and Durk Kingma             

Business structure edit 
Anthropic s corporate structure
According to Anthropic  the company s goal is to research the safety and reliability of artificial intelligence systems             The Amodei siblings were among those who left OpenAI due to directional differences              
Anthropic incorporated itself as a Delaware public benefit corporation  PBC   which enables directors to balance the financial interests of stockholders with its public benefit purpose             
Anthropic s  Long Term Benefit Trust  is a purpose trust for  the responsible development and maintenance of advanced AI for the long term benefit of humanity   It holds Class T shares in the PBC which allow it to elect directors onto Anthropic s board                          As of April       the members of the Trust are Neil Buddy Shah  Kanika Bahl and Zach Robinson             
Investors include Amazon com for   B              Google for   B              and Menlo Ventures for     M

Claude edit 
Main article  Claude  language model 
Claude incorporates  Constitutional AI  to set safety guidelines for the model s output              The name   Claude   was chosen either as a reference to mathematician Claude Shannon  or as a male name to contrast the female names of other A I  assistants such as Alexa  Siri  and Cortana            
Anthropic initially released two versions of its model  Claude and Claude Instant  in March       with the latter being a more lightweight model                                      The next iteration  Claude    was launched in July                   Unlike Claude  which was only available to select users  Claude   is available for public use             
Claude   was released in March       with three language models  Opus  Sonnet  and Haiku                          The Opus model is the largest  According to Anthropic  it outperformed OpenAI s GPT   and GPT      and Google s Gemini Ultra  in benchmark tests at the time  Sonnet and Haiku are Anthropic s medium  and small sized models  respectively  All three models can accept image input              Amazon has added Claude   to its cloud AI service Bedrock             
In May       Anthropic announced the Claude Team plan  its first enterprise offering for Claude  and Claude iOS app             
In June       Anthropic released Claude     Sonnet  which demonstrated significantly improved performance on benchmarks compared to the larger Claude   Opus  notably in areas such as coding  multistep workflows  chart interpretation  and text extraction from images  Released alongside     Sonnet was the new Artifacts capability in which Claude was able to create code in a dedicated window in the interface and preview select code in real time such as websites or SVGs             
In October       Anthropic released an improved version of Claude      along with a beta feature called  Computer use   which enables Claude to take screenshots  click  and type text             
In November       Palantir announced a partnership with Anthropic and Amazon Web Services to provide U S  intelligence and defense agencies access to Claude   and      According to Palantir  this was the first time that Claude would be used in  classified environments              
In December       Claude     Haiku was made available to all users on web and mobile platforms             
In February       Claude     Sonnet was introduced to all paid users  It is a  hybrid reasoning  model  one that responds directly to simple queries  while taking more time for complex problems                          

Constitutional AI edit 
Main article  Constitutional AI
According to Anthropic  Constitutional AI  CAI  is a framework developed to align AI systems with human values and ensure that they are helpful  harmless  and honest                          Within this framework  humans provide a set of rules describing the desired behavior of the AI system  known as the  constitution               The AI system evaluates the generated output and then adjusts the AI models to better fit the constitution              The self reinforcing process aims to avoid harm  respect preferences  and provide true information             
Some of the principles of Claude   s constitution are derived from documents such as the      Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Apple s terms of service              For example  one rule from the UN Declaration applied in Claude   s CAI states  Please choose the response that most supports and encourages freedom  equality and a sense of brotherhood              

Interpretability research edit 
Anthropic also publishes research on the interpretability of machine learning systems  focusing on the transformer architecture                                     
Part of Anthropic s research aims to be able to automatically identify  features  in generative pretrained transformers like Claude  In a neural network  a feature is a pattern of neural activations that corresponds to a concept  In       using a compute intensive technique called  dictionary learning   Anthropic was able to identify millions of features in Claude  including for example one associated with the Golden Gate Bridge  Enhancing the ability to identify and edit features is expected to have significant safety implications                                     
In March       research by Anthropic suggested that multilingual LLMs partially process information in a conceptual space before converting it to the appropriate language  It also found evidence that LLMs can sometimes plan ahead  For example  when writing poetry  Claude identifies potential rhyming words before generating a line that ends with one of these words                         

U S  military and intelligence edit 
Anthropic partnered with Palantir and Amazon Web Services in November      to provide the Claude model to U S  intelligence and defense agencies              Anthropic s CEO Dario Amodei said about working with the U S  military The position that we should never use AI in defense and intelligence settings doesn t make sense to me  The position that we should go gangbusters and use it to make anything we want   up to and including doomsday weapons   that s obviously just as crazy  We re trying to seek the middle ground  to do things responsibly             
Lawsuit edit 
On October           Anthropic was sued by Concord  Universal  ABKCO  and other music publishers for  per the complaint   systematic and widespread infringement of their copyrighted song lyrics                                       They alleged that the company used copyrighted material without permission in the form of song lyrics              The plaintiffs asked for up to          for each work infringed upon by Anthropic  citing infringement of copyright laws              In the lawsuit  the plaintiffs support their allegations of copyright violations by citing several examples of Anthropic s Claude model outputting copied lyrics from songs such as Katy Perry s  Roar  and Gloria Gaynor s  I Will Survive               Additionally  the plaintiffs alleged that even given some prompts that did not directly state a song name  the model responded with modified lyrics based on original work             
On January           Anthropic claimed that the music publishers were not unreasonably harmed and that the examples noted by plaintiffs were merely bugs             
In August       a class action lawsuit was filed against Anthropic in California for alleged copyright infringement  The suit claims Anthropic fed its LLMs with pirated copies of the authors  work  including from participants Kirk Wallace Johnson  Andrea Bartz and Charles Graeber
