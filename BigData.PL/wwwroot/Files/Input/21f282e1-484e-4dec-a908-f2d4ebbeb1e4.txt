Visual representation of a decision making problem
Not to be confused with binary decision diagram 
An influence diagram  ID   also called a relevance diagram  decision diagram or a decision network  is a compact graphical and mathematical representation of a decision situation   It is a generalization of a Bayesian network  in which not only probabilistic inference problems but also decision making problems  following the maximum expected utility criterion  can be modeled and solved 
ID was first developed in the mid     s by decision analysts with an intuitive semantic that is easy to understand  It is now adopted widely and becoming an alternative to the decision tree which typically suffers from exponential growth in number of branches with each variable modeled   ID is directly applicable in team decision analysis  since it allows incomplete sharing of information among team members to be modeled and solved explicitly   Extensions of ID also find their use in game theory as an alternative representation of the game tree 


Semantics edit 
An ID is a directed acyclic graph with three types  plus one subtype  of node and three types of arc  or arrow  between nodes 
Nodes 

Decision node  corresponding to each decision to be made  is drawn as a rectangle 
Uncertainty node  corresponding to each uncertainty to be modeled  is drawn as an oval 
Deterministic node  corresponding to special kind of uncertainty that its outcome is deterministically known whenever the outcome of some other uncertainties are also known  is drawn as a double oval 
Value node  corresponding to each component of additively separable Von Neumann Morgenstern utility function  is drawn as an octagon  or diamond  
Arcs 

Functional arcs  ending in value node  indicate that one of the components of additively separable utility function is a function of all the nodes at their tails 
Conditional arcs  ending in uncertainty node  indicate that the uncertainty at their heads is probabilistically conditioned on all the nodes at their tails 
Conditional arcs  ending in deterministic node  indicate that the uncertainty at their heads is deterministically conditioned on all the nodes at their tails 
Informational arcs  ending in decision node  indicate that the decision at their heads is made with the outcome of all the nodes at their tails known beforehand 
Given a properly structured ID 

Decision nodes and incoming information arcs collectively state the alternatives  what can be done when the outcome of certain decisions and or uncertainties are known beforehand 
Uncertainty deterministic nodes and incoming conditional arcs collectively model the information  what are known and their probabilistic deterministic relationships 
Value nodes and incoming functional arcs collectively quantify the preference  how things are preferred over one another  
Alternative  information  and preference are termed decision basis in decision analysis  they represent three required components of any valid decision situation 
Formally  the semantic of influence diagram is based on sequential construction of nodes and arcs  which implies a specification of all conditional independencies in the diagram   The specification is defined by the 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
      displaystyle d 
  
 separation criterion of Bayesian network   According to this semantic  every node is probabilistically 
independent on its non successor nodes given the outcome of its immediate predecessor nodes   Likewise  a missing arc between non value node 
  
    
      
        X

 and non value node 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
      displaystyle Y 
  
 implies that there exists a set of non value nodes

Example edit 
Simple influence diagram for making decision about vacation activity
Consider the simple influence diagram representing a situation where a decision maker is planning their vacation 

There is   decision node  Vacation Activity     uncertainty nodes  Weather Condition  Weather Forecast   and   value node  Satisfaction  
There are   functional arcs  ending in Satisfaction     conditional arc  ending in Weather Forecast   and   informational arc  ending in Vacation Activity  
Functional arcs ending in Satisfaction indicate that Satisfaction is a utility function of Weather Condition and Vacation Activity   In other words  their satisfaction can be quantified if they know what the weather is like and what their choice of activity is    Note that they do not value Weather Forecast directly 
Conditional arc ending in Weather Forecast indicates their belief that Weather Forecast and Weather Condition can be dependent 
Informational arc ending in Vacation Activity indicates that they will only know Weather Forecast  not Weather Condition  when making their choice   In other words  actual weather will be known after they make their choice  and only forecast is what they can count on at this stage 
It also follows semantically  for example  that Vacation Activity is independent on  irrelevant to  Weather Condition given Weather Forecast is known 
Applicability to value of information edit 
The above example highlights the power of the influence diagram in representing an extremely important concept in decision analysis known as the value of information   Consider the following three scenarios 

Scenario    The decision maker could make their Vacation Activity decision while knowing what Weather Condition will be like   This corresponds to adding extra informational arc from Weather Condition to Vacation Activity in the above influence diagram 
Scenario    The original influence diagram as shown above 
Scenario    The decision maker makes their decision without even knowing the Weather Forecast   This corresponds to removing informational arc from Weather Forecast to Vacation Activity in the above influence diagram 
Scenario   is the best possible scenario for this decision situation since there is no longer any uncertainty on what they care about  Weather Condition  when making their decision   Scenario    however  is the worst possible scenario for this decision situation since they need to make their decision without any hint  Weather Forecast  on what they care about  Weather Condition  will turn out to be 
The decision maker is usually better off  definitely no worse off  on average  to move from scenario   to scenario   through the acquisition of new information   The most they should be willing to pay for such move is called the value of information on Weather Forecast  which is essentially the value of imperfect information on Weather Condition 
The applicability of this simple ID and the value of information concept is tremendous  especially in medical decision making when most decisions have to be made with imperfect information about their patients  diseases  etc 

Related concepts edit 
Influence diagrams are hierarchical and can be defined either in terms of their structure or in greater detail in terms of the functional and numerical relation between diagram elements   An ID that is consistently defined at all levels       structure  function  and number       is a well defined mathematical representation and is referred to as a well formed influence diagram  WFID    WFIDs can be evaluated using reversal and removal operations to yield answers to a large class of probabilistic  inferential  and decision questions   More recent techniques have been developed by artificial intelligence researchers concerning Bayesian network inference  belief propagation  
An influence diagram having only uncertainty nodes  i e   a Bayesian network  is also called a relevance diagram   An arc connecting node A to B implies not only that  A is relevant to B   but also that  B is relevant to A   i e   relevance is a symmetric relationship
