Walter Pitts  right  with Jerome Lettvin  co author of the cognitive science paper  What the Frog s Eye Tells the Frog s Brain        
Walter Harry Pitts  Jr   April                 May           was an American logician who worked in the field of computational neuroscience              He proposed landmark theoretical formulations of neural activity and generative processes that influenced diverse fields such as cognitive sciences and psychology  philosophy  neurosciences  computer science  artificial neural networks  cybernetics and artificial intelligence  together with what has come to be known as the generative sciences  He is best remembered for having written along with Warren Sturgis McCulloch  a seminal paper in scientific history  titled A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity         This paper proposed the first mathematical model of a neural network  The unit of this model  a simple formalized neuron  is still the standard of reference in the field of neural networks  It is often called a McCulloch Pitts neuron   Prior to that paper  he formalized his ideas regarding the fundamental steps to building a Turing machine in  The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics  in an essay titled  Some observations on the simple neuron circuit  


Early life edit 
Walter Pitts was born in Detroit  Michigan on April           the son of Walter and Marie  n e Welsia   An autodidact  he taught himself logic and mathematics as a child and became a proficient reader in several languages  including Greek and Latin  He is widely remembered for having spent three days in a library  at the age of     reading Principia Mathematica and sent a letter to Bertrand Russell pointing out what he considered serious problems with the first half of the first volume  Russell was appreciative and invited him to study at Cambridge University at age     The offer was not taken up  however  Pitts did decide to become a logician  At age    he left home to study 

Academic career edit 
Pitts probably continued to correspond with Bertrand Russell  and at the age of    he attended Russell s lectures at the University of Chicago                        He stayed there  without registering as a student  While there  in      he met Jerome Lettvin  a pre medical student  and the two became close friends             Russell was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago in the fall of       and he directed Pitts to study with the logician Rudolf Carnap             Pitts met Carnap at Chicago by walking into his office during office hours  and presenting him with an annotated version of Carnap s recent book on logic  The Logical Syntax of Language              Since Pitts did not introduce himself  Carnap spent months searching for him  and  when he found him  he obtained for him a menial job at the university and had Pitts study with him  Pitts at the time was homeless and without income             He mastered Carnap s abstract logic  then met with and was intrigued by the work of the Ukrainian mathematical physicist Nicolas Rashevsky  who was also at Chicago and was the founder of mathematical biophysics  remodeling biology on the structure of the physical sciences and mathematical logic             Pitts also worked closely with the mathematician Alston Scott Householder  who was a member of Rashevsky s group                                   During his studies under Carnap  Pitts was also a regular attendant at Nicolas Rashevsky s seminars in theoretical biology  which included Frank Offner  Herbert Landahl  Alston Householder  and the neuroanatomist Gerhardt von Bonin from the University of Illinois at Chicago  In       Von Bonin introduced Lettvin to Warren McCulloch  who would become a professor of psychiatry at Illinois 
In      Warren McCulloch took a position as professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago  and in early      he invited Pitts  who was still homeless  together with Lettvin to live with his family              In the evenings  McCulloch and Pitts collaborated  Pitts was familiar with the work of Gottfried Leibniz on computing and they considered the question of whether the nervous system could be considered a kind of universal computing device as described by Leibniz  This led to their seminal neural networks paper  A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity   After five years of unofficial studies  the University of Chicago awarded Pitts an Associate of Arts  his only earned degree  for his work on the paper             
In       Lettvin introduced Pitts to Norbert Wiener at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Their first meeting  where they discussed Wiener s proof of the ergodic theorem  went so well that Pitts moved to Greater Boston to work with Wiener  While Pitts was an unofficial student under the aegis of Wiener at MIT until their acrimonious parting in       he formally enrolled as a graduate student in the physics department during the           academic year and in the electrical engineering department from                                   
In       Pitts was hired by Kellex Corporation  later acquired in      by Vitro Corporation  in New York City  part of the Atomic Energy Project             
From       Pitts was a core member of the Macy conferences  whose principal purpose was to set the foundations for a general science of the workings of the human mind 

Personal life  emotional trauma and decline edit 
In       Wiener convinced Jerome Wiesner to hire some physiologists of the nervous system  A group was established with Pitts  Lettvin  McCulloch  and Pat Wall  Pitts wrote a large dissertation on the properties of neural nets connected in three dimensions  Lettvin described him as  in no uncertain sense the genius of the group   when you asked him a question  you would get back a whole textbook               Pitts never married             Pitts was also described as an eccentric  refusing to allow his name to be made publicly available  He continued to refuse all offers of advanced degrees or positions of authority at MIT  in part as he would have to sign his name 
In       Wiener suddenly turned against McCulloch his wife  Margaret Wiener  hated McCulloch             and broke off relations with anyone connected to him  including Pitts             
Although he remained employed as a research associate in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT  as little more than a technicality              for the rest of his life  Pitts became increasingly socially isolated  In       the paradigmatic  What the Frog s Eye Tells the Frog s Brain   credited to Humberto Maturana  Lettvin  McCulloch and Pitts  conclusively demonstrated that  analog processes in the eye were doing at least part of the interpretive work  in image processing as opposed to  the brain computing information digital neuron by digital neuron using the exacting implement of mathematical logic   leading Pitts to burn his unpublished doctoral dissertation on probabilistic three dimensional neural networks and years of unpublished research  He took little further interest in work  excepting only a collaboration with Lettvin and Robert Gesteland which produced a paper on olfaction in      
Pitts died in      of bleeding esophageal varices  a condition usually associated with cirrhosis and alcoholism
