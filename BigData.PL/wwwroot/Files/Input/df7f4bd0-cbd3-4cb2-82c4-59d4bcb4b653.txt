Prerequisites to Learn Django 
Web framework Django based on Python  You have good knowledge about Python  Some other concepts you should be familiar with are  

 Understanding of  Syntax of Python    
 Understanding of  importing and exporting modules  is required in the project development phase  
 Understanding Python path concepts t  o access the data  images or any kind of data  
 Knowledge of Object Oriented concepts  as it reduces the code repetition with classes and objects  
 Knowledge about  HTML   CSS   JavaScript are very important  As they are the building block of  Web development    
 Knowledge about Data Structures like Tuple and List are important  

Getting Started with Django 
In this getting started with Django section  you will learn how to get up and running with Django  a powerful web framework for building dynamic websites and applications  Django makes it easy to organize your project into different apps  each handling specific functionality  You ll begin by creating a project  which will automatically set up everything you need  from a folder structure to basic settings

Once you       ve mastered the basics from this tutorial  the Complete Django Web Development Course         Basics to Advance is a perfect next step to dive deeper into both beginner and advanced Django concepts 
Django Views 
In Django views are the backbone of handling user requests and rendering responses  There are two primary paradigms for implementing views  Function Based Views  FBVs  and Class Based Views  CBVs   Function Based Views offer simplicity and directness  allowing developers to define views as Python functions  Within this paradigm  common functionalities like creating  listing  displaying details  updating  and deleting objects are implemented as separate functions  
While both paradigms have their merits  the choice between FBVs and CBVs ultimately depends on factors such as project requirements  development preferences  and scalability concerns  

 Function Based Views 

 Create View 
 List View 
 Detail View 
 Update View 
 Delete View 


 Class Based Generic Views Django 

 Createview 
 ListView 
 DetailView 
 UpdateView 
 DeleteView 
 FormView 


 Class Based vs Function Based Views 

Django URLs 
In Django URL patterns serve as a crucial mechanism for directing incoming requests to the appropriate views within your web application  With the flexibility of regular expressions  Django       s URL dispatcher allows you to define patterns that match specific URL patterns and route them to corresponding views  When dealing with GET parameters passed through URLs in Django  accessing these parameters within views is straightforward  enabling efficient handling of user inputs and customization of responses  

 Django URL patterns 
 Get parameters passed by urls in Django 
 URL Validator in Django 
 URL Shortener with Django 
 Django URLResolver error 

Django Templates 
In Django  URLs play a crucial role in navigating through different views and templates within your web application  When working with Django templates  several key concepts enhance the flexibility and functionality of your frontend  Template filters allow you to manipulate variables displayed in your templates  enabling transformations like date formatting or string manipulation  

 Template Filters 
 Template Tags 
 variables 
 Boolean Operators 
 for loop 
 if   Django Templates 
 Template Inheritance 

Django Models 
Django Models serve as the backbone of database operations  facilitating seamless management of data  This guide delves into various aspects of Django Models  starting from the fundamental operations of inserting  updating  and deleting data using the Object Relational Mapping  ORM  provided by Django  
 Here  You       ll learn how to create a basic app model  initialize migrations  and execute them to synchronize your database schema  Moreover  we delve into built in field validations  ensuring data integrity and consistency  while also delving into the customization of these validations to suit specific application requirements

Django Forms 
To start  you can create a form using Django Forms by defining a class that inherits from Django       s forms Form class  Within this class  you can specify the fields you want to include in your form using various field types provided by Django  such as CharField  IntegerField  EmailField  etc  Once you       ve defined your form  you can render HTML forms in Django using both GET and POST methods  Django       s built in template tags and filters make it easy to render forms in your HTML templates while ensuring security and CSRF protection  
 Django Forms offer a wide range of field types to cater to different data types and validation requirements  Additionally  you can customize the appearance and behavior of form fields by using form field custom widgets  allowing you to enhance user experience and tailor forms to your specific needs
