Cynthia Dwork  born June              citation needed       is an American computer scientist renowned for her contributions to cryptography  distributed computing  and algorithmic fairness  She is one of the inventors of differential privacy and proof of work 
Dwork works at Harvard University  where she is Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science  Radcliffe Alumnae Professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study  and Affiliated Professor at Harvard Law School and Harvard s Department of Statistics 


Early life and education edit 
Dwork received her B S E  from Princeton University in       graduating Cum Laude  and receiving the Charles Ira Young Award for Excellence in Independent Research 
Dwork received her Ph D  from Cornell University in                 for research supervised by John Hopcroft                       

Career and research edit 
Dwork is known for her research placing privacy preserving data analysis on a mathematically rigorous foundation  including the invention of differential privacy in the early to mid     s  a strong privacy guarantee frequently permitting highly accurate data analysis              The definition of differential privacy relies on the notion of indistinguishability of the outputs irrespective of whether an individual has contributed their data or not  This is typically achieved by adding small amounts of noise either to the input data or to outputs of computations performed on the data             She uses a systems based approach to studying fairness in algorithms including those used for placing ads             Dwork has also made contributions in cryptography and distributed computing  and is a recipient of the Edsger W  Dijkstra Prize for her early work on the foundations of fault tolerant systems            
Her contributions in cryptography include non malleable cryptography with Danny Dolev and Moni Naor in       the first lattice based cryptosystem with Mikl s Ajtai in       which was also the first public key cryptosystem for which breaking a random instance is as hard as solving the hardest instance of the underlying mathematical problem   worst case average case equivalence    With Naor she also first presented the idea of  and a technique for  combating e mail spam by requiring a proof of computational effort  also known as proof of work   a key technology underlying hashcash and bitcoin

In       both the International Association for Cryptologic Research      TCC Test of Time Award             and the      G del Prize were awarded to Cynthia Dwork  Frank McSherry  Kobbi Nissim and Adam D  Smith for their seminal paper that introduced differential privacy             
In       she received the IEEE Richard W  Hamming Medal for  foundational work in privacy  cryptography  and distributed computing  and for leadership in developing differential privacy              
She is the      winner of the Knuth Prize             
She is a co winner of the      ACM Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award for her and her co authors   fundamental contributions to the development of differential privacy              
She is co winner of the      RSA Award for Excellence in Mathematics for  contributions to the foundation of privacy and to the foundations of cryptography              
In       her      STOC paper  with Dolev and Naor   Non Malleable Cryptography               won a STOC    year Test of Time award             
In       Dwork was a recipient of the National Medal of Science
