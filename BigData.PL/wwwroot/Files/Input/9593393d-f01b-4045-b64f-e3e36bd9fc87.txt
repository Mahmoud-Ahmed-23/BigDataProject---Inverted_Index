							The number of people out of work in Germany rose in July  ending nine consecutive months of falls  Still  the jobless rate remains at its lowest level since German reunification in      
There were roughly     million people registered as unemployed in July  the German Federal Labor Agency said on Thursday  The new figures marked an uptick of        over the previous month  but compared to one year ago there were        fewer people without a job

Graduating students signing on for benefits and trainees seeking jobs were the reason behind the rise in unemployment  said Frank Juergen Weise  head of the Federal Labor Agency

Refugees        a challenge         not a burden
Some analysts expect the recent boom in the German labor market to weaken in the months ahead 
       It will continue to get better  but more slowly         said Michael Holstein  an economist at DZ Bank 
Other economists expect a slight rise in unemployment in the course of this year  but most see stagnating unemployment figures 
The growing influx of refugees in Germany poses        no doubt a challenge         said labor office head Weise  but he added that it would not overburden the German labor market 
In its outlook for       the Labor Agency expects an average of      million unemployed  improvement of         compared to previous outlooks  according to Weise 
Germany       s labor market contrasts starkly with those in some southern European countries  In Greece and Spain  for instance  unemployment rates have been hovering well over    percent for years 
Even in neighboring France  where new figures were published this week  the unemployment rate is about twice as high as in Germany
