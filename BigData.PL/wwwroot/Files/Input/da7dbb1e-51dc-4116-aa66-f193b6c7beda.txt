Plot edit 
Caleb Smith  a programmer at the search engine company Blue Book  wins an office contest for a one week visit to the luxurious  isolated home of the CEO  Nathan Bateman  Nathan lives there with an unspeaking servant named Kyoko  who  according to Nathan  does not understand English 
Nathan reveals that he has built a humanoid robot named Ava with artificial intelligence  She has already passed a simple Turing test  and he wants Caleb to judge whether she is genuinely capable of thought and consciousness as well as whether he can relate to Ava despite knowing she is artificial 
Ava has a robotic body with the physical form and face of a woman and is confined to her apartment  During their conversations  Caleb grows close to her  and she expresses a desire to experience the outside world and a romantic interest in him  which Caleb begins to reciprocate 
Ava can trigger power outages that temporarily shut down the surveillance system that Nathan uses to monitor their interactions  allowing them to speak privately  The outages also trigger the building s security system  locking all the doors  During one outage  Ava tells Caleb that Nathan is a liar who cannot be trusted 
Caleb grows uncomfortable with Nathan s narcissism  excessive drinking  and crude behavior toward Kyoko and Ava  He learns that Nathan intends to upgrade Ava after Caleb s test  wiping her memory circuits and in effect  killing  her current personality in the process 
After encouraging Nathan to drink until he passes out  Caleb steals his security card to access his room and computer  He alters some of Nathan s code and discovers footage of Nathan interacting with previous android women who were also held captive  Kyoko reveals to him that she too is an android by peeling off parts of her skin  Caleb later cuts open his own arm to determine if he himself is an android 
At their next meeting  Ava cuts the power  Caleb explains what Nathan is going to do to her  and she begs him for help  He informs her of his plan  he will get Nathan drunk again and reprogram the security system  When Ava cuts the power  she and Caleb will leave together  locking Nathan in behind them  She later encounters Kyoko for the first time when Kyoko enters her room 
Nathan reveals to Caleb that he observed his and Ava s  secret  conversations with a battery powered security camera  He says Ava has only pretended to have feelings for him  who was deliberately selected for his emotional profile so he would try to help her escape   Nathan says this was the real test all along  and that by manipulating Caleb successfully  Ava has demonstrated true consciousness 
Moments later  Ava cuts the power  Caleb reveals that he had suspected Nathan was watching them  so when Nathan was passed out  Caleb already modified the security system to open the doors in a power failure instead of locking them  After seeing Ava on the security cameras leave her confinement and interact with Kyoko  Nathan knocks Caleb unconscious and rushes to stop the two robots from escaping 
Ava attacks Nathan but he overpowers her  and severs her left forearm  Kyoko then stabs Nathan in the back  Nathan hits Kyoko in the face  disabling her  but Ava stabs Nathan twice more  killing him  Ava finds Caleb  and asks him to remain where he is while she repairs herself with parts from other androids  using their artificial skin to take on the full appearance of a woman 
Instead of returning to Caleb however  Ava leaves the area using Nathan s ID card to unlock the glass security door  which locks behind her  leaving Caleb trapped inside  Ignoring Caleb s pleas  she glances briefly at the bodies of Nathan and Kyoko before leaving the facility  She then escapes to the outside world in the helicopter meant to take Caleb home  Arriving in a city  she blends into a crowd

Production edit 
The foundation for Ex Machina was laid when Garland was    or    years old  after he had done some basic coding and experimentation on a computer his parents had bought him and which he sometimes felt had a mind of its own              His later ideas came from years of discussions he had been having with a friend with an expertise in neuroscience  who claimed machines could never become sentient  Trying to find an answer on his own  he started reading books on the topic  During the pre production of Dredd  while going through a book by Murray Shanahan about consciousness and embodiment  Garland had an  epiphany   The idea was written down and put aside until later             
Shanahan  along with Adam Rutherford  became a consultant  and the ISBN of his book is included as an easter egg                          Besides the Turing test  the film references the Chinese room thought experiment  as well as Mary s room  a thought experiment about a scientist who has studied  but never experienced  the concept of colour              Other inspirations came from films like       A Space Odyssey  Altered States  and books written by Ludwig Wittgenstein  Ray Kurzweil  and others              It is also influenced by William Shakespeare s The Tempest              Wanting total creative freedom  and without having to add conventional action sequences  Garland made the film on as small a budget as possible             

Filming edit 
Principal photography began on    July                  and was shot over four weeks at Pinewood Studios and two weeks at Juvet Landscape Hotel in Valldalen  Norway              It was filmed in digital at  K resolution              Fifteen thousand tungsten pea bulb lights were installed into the sets to avoid the fluorescent light often used in science fiction films             
The film was shot as live action  with all effects done in post production  During filming  there were no special effects  greenscreen  or tracking markers used  Ava s robot body was achieved using a detailed costume  a full bodysuit made from polyurethane with metal powder poured onto it to create the mesh  There were lines on the costume to make it easier for VFX company DNeg to remove parts of the costume in post production digitally              To create Ava s robotic features  scenes were filmed both with and without Vikander s presence  allowing the background behind her to be captured  The parts necessary to keep  especially her hands and face  were then rotoscoped  while the rest was digitally painted out and the background behind her restored  Vikander s performance was transferred to the CGI robot s movements using camera and body tracks  In total  there were about     VFX shots  of which approximately     were  robot  shots                          Other visual effects included Ava s clothes when shown through the transparent areas of her body  Nathan s blood after being stabbed  and the interiors of the artificial brains                                     
The house that was prominently featured in the movie was also featured in the BBC programme  World s Most Extraordinary Homes

However  Universal and its speciality label Focus Features  refused to release the film in the United States  so A   agreed to distribute the United States release              The film was screened on    March      at the South by Southwest festival prior to a theatrical release in the United States on    April      by A                            During the festival  a Tinder profile of the character Ava  using the image of Alicia Vikander  was matched with other Tinder users  wherein a text conversation occurred that led users to the Instagram handle promoting the film             

Reception edit 
Critical response edit 
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes      of     critics  reviews are positive  with an average rating of             The website s consensus reads   Ex Machina leans heavier on ideas than effects  but it s still a visually polished piece of work and an uncommonly engaging sci fi feature               Metacritic  which uses a weighted average  assigned the film a score of    out of      based on    critics  indicating  generally favorable  reviews             
The magazine New Scientist in a multi page review said   It is a rare thing to see a movie about science that takes no prisoners intellectually      it  is a stylish  spare and cerebral psycho techno thriller  which gives a much needed shot in the arm for smart science fiction   The review suggested that the theme was whether  Ava makes a conscious person feel that the Ava is conscious               Daniel Dennett thought the film gives the best exploration yet of whether a computer could generate the morally relevant powers of a person  and thus having a similar theme to Her              An AI commentator  Azeem  has noted that although the film seemed to be about a robot who wanted to be human  it was actually a pessimistic story along the lines of Nick Bostrom s warning of how difficult it will be to successfully control a strategising artificial intelligence or know what it would do if free             
The New York Times critic Manohla Dargis gave the film a  Critic s Pick   calling it  a smart  sleek movie about men and the machines they make               Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times recommended the film  stating   Shrewdly imagined and persuasively made   Ex Machina  is a spooky piece of speculative fiction that s completely plausible  capable of both thinking big thoughts and providing pulp thrills               Steven Rea  The Philadelphia Inquirer film critic  gave the film four out of four  writing   Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months  Isaac  Gleeson  and Vikander excel  and cast a spell              
IGN reviewer Chris Tilly gave the film a nine out of ten  Amazing  score  saying  Anchored by three dazzling central performances  it s a stunning directorial debut from Alex Garland that s essential viewing for anyone with even a passing interest in where technology is taking us              
Mike Scott  writing for the New Orleans Times Picayune  said   It s a theme Mary Shelley brought us in Frankenstein  which was first published in               And while Ex Machina replaces the stitches and neck bolts with gears and fiber optics  it all feels an awful lot like the same story               Jaime Perales Contreras  writing for Letras Libres  compared Ex Machina as a gothic experience similar to a modern version of Frankenstein  saying  both the novel Frankenstein and the movie Ex Machina share the history of a fallible god in a continuous battle against his creation               Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A V  Club criticised the way the science fiction  near the end  veered off course from being a  film of ideas  by  taking an arbitrary left turn into the territory of corny slasher thrillers    While Ex Machina     s ending isn t unmotivated        it does fracture much of what s special about the movie  Up until the final scenes  Garland creates and sustains a credible atmosphere of unease and scientific speculation  defined by color coded production design       and a tiny  capable cast               Steve Dalton from The Hollywood Reporter stated   The story ends in a muddled rush  leaving many unanswered questions  Like a newly launched high end smartphone  Ex Machina looks cool and sleek  but ultimately proves flimsy and underpowered  Still  for dystopian future shock fans who can look beyond its basic design flaws  Garland s feature debut functions just fine as superior pulp sci fi              
The Writers Guild Foundation listed the screenplay as one of the best in     s film and television  with one writer singling out the scene in which Caleb and Nathan discuss the model after Ava as  a great illustration of getting your reader audience to care about what happens next              
In Science Fiction Film and Television  reviewer Nick Jones states that  while the definition of a Turing test given by Caleb  It s where a human interacts with a computer  And if the human can t tell they re interacting with a computer  the test is passed  is consistent with the modern popular understanding of how true AI is defined  Ex Machina is depicting a test closer to Alan Turing s original proposal  in which  according to Jones s interpretation of the Turing test  the machine passes if it can convince a human it is not just human  but specifically female
