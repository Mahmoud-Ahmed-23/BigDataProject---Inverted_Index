Robert Chester Wilson Ettinger     t   r   December                           July                      was an American academic  known as  the father of cryonics  because of the impact of his      book The Prospect of Immortality                       
Ettinger founded the Cryonics Institute            and the related Immortalist Society and until      served as the groups  president  His body has been cryopreserved  like the bodies of his first and second wives  and his mother 


Personal background edit 
Ettinger was born in Atlantic City  New Jersey  the son of Russian Jewish immigrants             Raised Jewish  he later attended Protestant Unitarian             church services            before becoming an atheist             He served as a second lieutenant infantryman in the United States Army during World War II  Severely wounded in battle in Germany  he received the Purple Heart            and recovered after several years spent in a Michigan hospital              He earned two master s degrees from Wayne State University  one in physics  one in mathematics  and spent his working career teaching physics and mathematics at both Wayne State University and Highland Park Community college in Michigan            
Ettinger had two children with his first wife  Elaine  David        and Shelley                    David gave his first cryonics interview to journalists at the age of    and was an attorney  He served as legal counsel to the Cryonics Institute and the Immortalist Society  Robert Ettinger s daughter  who has had no interest in cryonics  is a writer and revolutionary socialist 
Ettinger met his second wife  Mae Junod  in      when she attended one of his adult education courses in basic physics  Junod typed and assisted with editing the manuscripts for both The Prospect of Immortality and Man Into Superman  She became active in the Cryonics Society of Michigan  CSM  and edited and was a production manager for the CSM monthly newsletter  The Outlook  In the     s The Outlook was renamed The Immortalist and Junod continued editorship until the mid     s  The Outlook is the longest continuously published cryonics magazine      citation needed      Junod was an author  feminist  and marriage counselor 
Ettinger married Junod in      after the death of his first wife             Ettinger described his time with Junod as one of the most satisfying and tranquil times in his life  The couple moved to Scottsdale  Arizona in      and enjoyed a period of domestic life during which time the couple began to ease into retirement from over    years of cryonics activism and the attendant burdens of work and controversy             Mae Ettinger suffered a debilitating stroke in      from which she never fully recovered followed by a lethal stroke in       which resulted in her cryopreservation 
Ettinger died on July           at the age of     in Detroit  Michigan of natural causes  and was cryopreserved with the hope of future revival                        

Roots of cryonics in science fiction edit 
Ettinger grew up reading Hugo Gernsback s Amazing Stories              Ettinger was particularly affected when he was    years old by a Neil R  Jones story   The Jameson Satellite   which appeared in the July      issue of Amazing Stories              in which one Professor Jameson had his corpse sent into earth orbit where  as the author mistakenly thought  it would remain preserved indefinitely at near absolute zero  And so it did  in the story  until millions of years later  when  with humanity extinct  a race of mechanical men with organic brains chanced upon it  They revived and repaired Jameson s brain  installed it in a mechanical body  and he became one of their company            
Ettinger assumed that one day        long before he grew old        biologists would learn the secret of eternal youth  As he grew out of boyhood in the     s  he began to suspect it might take a little longer since no scientists were yet working on this particular endeavor              If immortality is achievable through the ministrations of technologically advanced aliens repairing a frozen human corpse  then Ettinger thought everyone could be cryopreserved to await later rescue by our own medically more sophisticated descendants             
In       Ettinger s short story  The Penultimate Trump  was published in Startling Stories  The story sets out the development of a method of putting people into  suspended animation  until medical science can restore their health  and the changes found by the first of those when he is revived 

Launching the cryonics movement edit 
Ettinger waited expectantly for prominent scientists or physicians to come to the same conclusion he had  and to take a position of public advocacy  By       Ettinger finally made the scientific case for the idea  which had always been in the back of his mind  Ettinger was    years old and said he was increasingly aware of his own mortality              In what has been characterized as an historically important mid life crisis              Ettinger summarized the idea of cryonics in a few pages  with the emphasis on life insurance  and sent this to approximately     people whom he selected from Who s Who in America              The response was very small  and it was clear that a much longer exposition was needed        mostly to counter cultural bias  Ettinger correctly saw that people  even the intellectually  financially and socially distinguished  would have to be educated into understanding his belief that dying is usually gradual and could be a reversible process  and that freezing damage is so limited  even though fatal by present criteria  that its reversibility demands relatively little in future progress  Ettinger soon made an even more troubling discovery  principally that  a great many people have to be coaxed into admitting that life is better than death  healthy is better than sick  smart is better than stupid  and immortality might be worth the trouble              
In       Ettinger privately published a preliminary version of The Prospect of Immortality  in which he said that future technological advances could be used to bring people back to life  This finally attracted attention of a major publisher  which sent a copy to Isaac Asimov  Asimov said that the science behind cryonics was sound              and the manuscript was approved for a      Doubleday hardcover and various subsequent editions which launched cryonics             The book became a selection of the Book of the Month Club and was published in nine languages             
Ettinger became an  overnight              media celebrity  discussed in The New York Times  Time  Newsweek  Paris Match  Der Spiegel  Christian Century  and dozens of other periodicals  He appeared on television with David Frost  Johnny Carson  Steve Allen  and others  Ettinger also spoke on radio programs coast to coast to promote the idea of human cryopreservation 
Since the commercial publication of The Prospect of Immortality  all those active in cryonics today can trace their involvement  directly or indirectly  to the publication of one or both of Ettinger s books      citation needed      While Ettinger was the first  most articulate  and most scientifically credible person to argue the idea of cryonics      citation needed      he was not the only one  In       Evan Cooper had authored a manuscript entitled  Immortality  Physically  Scientifically  Now              under the pseudonym Nathan Duhring              Cooper s book contained the same argument as did Ettinger s  but it lacked both scientific and technical rigor and was not of publication quality      citation needed
