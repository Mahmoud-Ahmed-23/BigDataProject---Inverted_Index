							During the enchanting nights of Ramadan  the talented actress Amina Khalil shines in a daring role in  Lam Shamseya   The series boldly addresses a sensitive issue that deeply resonates with society during the holy month  In the series  Amina portrays        Nelly         a teacher at an international school who faces the immense challenge of protecting children from harm and bullying  Daily News Egypt sat down with Amina to discuss her journey with this groundbreaking series and more 
After the first episodes of  Lam Shamseya  aired  how did you receive the audience s reactions 
I m so happy with the strong audience reactions to the series  It s incredibly satisfying to see it resonate deeply with viewers  The gratitude I feel is immense  especially considering the tremendous effort from everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera 
What attracted you to the role of  Nelly  in this series 
The series addresses a sensitive topic that hasn t been explored this way before  It presents a unique storyline  with the issue being introduced from the very first episodes  creating an immediate and shocking impact on viewers 
How do you see the impact of this work on society 
The series adopts a bold and daring dramatic approach to shed light on the ethical and social responsibilities concerning child abuse  It raises complex  thought provoking questions about where the responsibility lies and how to tackle this phenomenon effectively 
How was your experience working with the cast and crew 
I am very happy to collaborate with director Karim El Shenawy for the fourth time  He is someone I deeply respect  and his creative vision always inspires me  Working with a distinguished team has truly been a pleasure  and together  we ve created a drama that addresses important societal issues 
What drew you to  Lam Shamseya  and convinced you to accept the lead role 
The script  written by Mariam Naoum  is extraordinary it s both powerful and thought provoking  Also  working with Karim El Shenawy  one of the directors I feel most comfortable with  made it an easy decision  The story s strength and its focus on significant social issues excited me and convinced me to take on the project 

It has been said that the series was initially intended for Mona Zaki  Did it bother you to be considered her        replacement        
Not at all  This is a natural occurrence in the world of art and acting  Sometimes  a role is offered to an actor who later declines it for various reasons  and it s then passed on to someone else  Mona Zaki is an extraordinary actress  and I m confident she would ve portrayed the character brilliantly had she continued with it  I m simply happy to have taken on the role and am doing my utmost to present it in the best possible way 
Recently  you have starred in several films  Was this intentional 
It wasn t planned  but when I m offered good projects  I find it hard to say no  I absolutely loved the roles I played in  Wesh x Wesh    Shekko   and  Ex Meraty   and I m thrilled with their success  What matters most to me is selecting roles that resonate with the audience and leave a lasting impact 
Is there really a second part of  Shekko  
Yes  preparations are underway for a sequel  and more details will be announced soon  Given the film s great success  it feels only natural to continue the story 
In  Shekko   you played a dancer  Did you hesitate before accepting the role 
Initially  yes  I never imagined myself in such a role  but it turned out to be a new challenge for me as an actress  I read the script multiple times and found the character to be written with incredible precision  The director and the entire team supported and encouraged me  which ultimately helped me embrace the challenge 
Do you deliberately choose roles that address women s issues 
Not necessarily  I don t actively seek out feminist roles  but they seem to find me  What truly matters to me is the quality of the script and the strength of the character  If a role is compelling and impactful  I m happy to take it on  regardless of whether it focuses on women s issues or not 
The audience sees you as an        inspiration        for women  How do you feel about this title 
It s a great honor for me  though it s not something I actively seek  What makes me happiest is knowing that my roles leave a lasting impact  whether on women or men  My ultimate aim is to create meaningful art that carries a message while also entertaining audiences 
There is clear chemistry between you and Mohamed Mamdouh  What is the secret behind your successful partnership 
Mamdouh is one of my closest friends  and we have a deep understanding of each other  both personally and professionally  This natural connection translates effortlessly on screen  I enjoy working with him immensely  and I hope we ll continue collaborating on future projects 
Are you considering marriage soon   
Marriage is a matter of fate  If the right person comes along  it ll happen  For now  I m focused on my career and taking things as they come 
What qualities do you seek in a life partner   
Honesty is a must  I also look for someone who shares my mindset  as that can prevent many conflicts in the future 
Could acting complicate marriage   
I don t believe so  but I wouldn t marry someone who disrespects or dismisses my profession  Acting is an integral part of who I am  and my partner must accept and support that 
What s your relationship with fashion   
I m passionate about fashion and love shopping  Experimenting with styles and finding pieces that reflect my personality is exciting  Dubai  in particular  is a favorite shopping destination of mine 
What are your upcoming projects   
I m preparing for Shekko s sequel and reviewing other exciting scripts  I ll share more when decisions are made 
Any final words for your fans   
I love and appreciate you all  Thank you for your ongoing support  and I promise to keep delivering work that meets your expectations and leaves a lasting impression
