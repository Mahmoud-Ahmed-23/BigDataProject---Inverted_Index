This article is about mathematical processing of digital images  For artistic processing of images  see Image editing  For compression algorithms  see Image compression 


 Image processing  redirects here and is not to be confused with Analog image processing 
Digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm                        As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing  digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing  It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build up of noise and distortion during processing  Since images are defined over two dimensions  perhaps more   digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems  The generation and development of digital image processing are mainly affected by three factors  first  the development of computers             second  the development of mathematics  especially the creation and improvement of discrete mathematics theory              and third  the demand for a wide range of applications in environment  agriculture  military  industry and medical science has increased            


History edit 
Further information  Digital image        History  and Digital imaging        History
Many of the techniques of digital image processing  or digital picture processing as it often was called  were developed in the     s  at Bell Laboratories  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  University of Maryland  and a few other research facilities  with application to satellite imagery  wire photo standards conversion  medical imaging  videophone  character recognition  and photograph enhancement             The purpose of early image processing was to improve the quality of the image  It was aimed for human beings to improve the visual effect of people  In image processing  the input is a low quality image  and the output is an image with improved quality  Common image processing include image enhancement  restoration  encoding  and compression  The first successful application was the American Jet Propulsion Laboratory  JPL   They used image processing techniques such as geometric correction  gradation transformation  noise removal  etc  on the thousands of lunar photos sent back by the Space Detector Ranger   in       taking into account the position of the Sun and the environment of the Moon  The impact of the successful mapping of the Moon s surface map by the computer has been a success  Later  more complex image processing was performed on the nearly         photos sent back by the spacecraft  so that the topographic map  color map and panoramic mosaic of the Moon were obtained  which achieved extraordinary results and laid a solid foundation for human landing on the Moon            
The cost of processing was fairly high  however  with the computing equipment of that era  That changed in the     s  when digital image processing proliferated as cheaper computers and dedicated hardware became available  This led to images being processed in real time  for some dedicated problems such as television standards conversion  As general purpose computers became faster  they started to take over the role of dedicated hardware for all but the most specialized and computer intensive operations  With the fast computers and signal processors available in the     s  digital image processing has become the most common form of image processing  and is generally used because it is not only the most versatile method  but also the cheapest 

Image sensors edit

The basis for modern image sensors is metal oxide semiconductor  MOS  technology             invented at Bell Labs between      and                                                                              This led to the development of digital semiconductor image sensors  including the charge coupled device  CCD  and later the CMOS sensor            
The charge coupled device was invented by Willard S  Boyle and George E  Smith at Bell Labs in                   While researching MOS technology  they realized that an electric charge was the analogy of the magnetic bubble and that it could be stored on a tiny MOS capacitor  As it was fairly straightforward to fabricate a series of MOS capacitors in a row  they connected a suitable voltage to them so that the charge could be stepped along from one to the next             The CCD is a semiconductor circuit that was later used in the first digital video cameras for television broadcasting             
The NMOS active pixel sensor  APS  was invented by Olympus in Japan during the mid     s  This was enabled by advances in MOS semiconductor device fabrication  with MOSFET scaling reaching smaller micron and then sub micron levels                          The NMOS APS was fabricated by Tsutomu Nakamura s team at Olympus in                   The CMOS active pixel sensor  CMOS sensor  was later developed by Eric Fossum s team at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in                   By       sales of CMOS sensors had surpassed CCD sensors             
MOS image sensors are widely used in optical mouse technology  The first optical mouse  invented by Richard F  Lyon at Xerox in       used a         m NMOS integrated circuit sensor chip                          Since the first commercial optical mouse  the IntelliMouse introduced in       most optical mouse devices use CMOS sensors                         

Image compression edit 
Main article  Image compression
An important development in digital image compression technology was the discrete cosine transform  DCT   a lossy compression technique first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in                   DCT compression became the basis for JPEG  which was introduced by the Joint Photographic Experts Group in                   JPEG compresses images down to much smaller file sizes  and has become the most widely used image file format on the Internet              Its highly efficient DCT compression algorithm was largely responsible for the wide proliferation of digital images and digital photos              with several billion JPEG images produced every day as of          update                  
Medical imaging techniques produce very large amounts of data  especially from CT  MRI and PET modalities  As a result  storage and communications of electronic image data are prohibitive without the use of compression                          JPEG      image compression is used by the DICOM standard for storage and transmission of medical images  The cost and feasibility of accessing large image data sets over low or various bandwidths are further addressed by use of another DICOM standard  called JPIP  to enable efficient streaming of the JPEG      compressed image data             

Digital signal processor  DSP  edit 
Main article  Digital signal processor
Electronic signal processing was revolutionized by the wide adoption of MOS technology in the     s              MOS integrated circuit technology was the basis for the first single chip microprocessors and microcontrollers in the early     s              and then the first single chip digital signal processor  DSP  chips in the late     s                          DSP chips have since been widely used in digital image processing             
The discrete cosine transform  DCT  image compression algorithm has been widely implemented in DSP chips  with many companies developing DSP chips based on DCT technology  DCTs are widely used for encoding  decoding  video coding  audio coding  multiplexing  control signals  signaling  analog to digital conversion  formatting luminance and color differences  and color formats such as YUV    and YUV     DCTs are also used for encoding operations such as motion estimation  motion compensation  inter frame prediction  quantization  perceptual weighting  entropy encoding  variable encoding  and motion vectors  and decoding operations such as the inverse operation between different color formats  YIQ  YUV and RGB  for display purposes  DCTs are also commonly used for high definition television  HDTV  encoder decoder chips

To apply the affine matrix to an image  the image is converted to matrix in which each entry corresponds to the pixel intensity at that location  Then each pixel s location can be represented as a vector indicating the coordinates of that pixel in the image   x  y   where x and y are the row and column of a pixel in the image matrix  This allows the coordinate to be multiplied by an affine transformation matrix  which gives the position that the pixel value will be copied to in the output image 
However  to allow transformations that require translation transformations    dimensional homogeneous coordinates are needed  The third dimension is usually set to a non zero constant  usually    so that the new coordinate is  x  y      This allows the coordinate vector to be multiplied by a     matrix  enabling translation shifts  Thus  the third dimension  i e  the constant    allows translation 
Because matrix multiplication is associative  multiple affine transformations can be combined into a single affine transformation by multiplying the matrix of each individual transformation in the order that the transformations are done  This results in a single matrix that  when applied to a point vector  gives the same result as all the individual transformations performed on the vector  x  y     in sequence  Thus a sequence of affine transformation matrices can be reduced to a single affine transformation matrix 
For example    dimensional coordinates only permit rotation about the origin         But   dimensional homogeneous coordinates can be used to first translate any point to         then perform the rotation  and lastly translate the origin        back to the original point  the opposite of the first translation   These three affine transformations can be combined into a single matrix thus allowing rotation around any point in the image             

Image denoising with mathematical morphology edit 
Mathematical morphology  MM  is a nonlinear image processing framework that analyzes shapes within images by probing local pixel neighborhoods using a small  predefined function called a structuring element  In the context of grayscale images  MM is especially useful for denoising through dilation and erosion primitive operators that can be combined to build more complex filters

Opening and Closing edit 
MM operations  such as opening and closing  are composite processes that utilize both dilation and erosion to modify the structure of an image  These operations are particularly useful for tasks such as noise removal  shape smoothing  and object separation 

Opening  This operation is performed by applying erosion to an image first  followed by dilation  The purpose of opening is to remove small objects or noise from the foreground while preserving the overall structure of larger objects  It is especially effective in situations where noise appears as isolated bright pixels or small  disconnected features 
For example  applying opening to an image 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
      displaystyle f 
  
 with a structuring element 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
      displaystyle B 
  
 would first reduce small details  through erosion  and then restore the main shapes  through dilation   This ensures that unwanted noise is removed without significantly altering the size or shape of larger objects 

Closing  This operation is performed by applying dilation first  followed by erosion  Closing is typically used to fill small holes or gaps within objects and to connect broken parts of the foreground  It works by initially expanding the boundaries of objects  through dilation  and then refining the boundaries  through erosion  
For instance  applying closing to the same image 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
      displaystyle f 
  
 would fill in small gaps within objects  such as connecting breaks in thin lines or closing small holes  while ensuring that the surrounding areas are not significantly affected 
Both opening and closing can be visualized as ways of refining the structure of an image  opening simplifies and removes small  unnecessary details  while closing consolidates and connects objects to form more cohesive structures

Applications edit 
Further information  Digital imaging and Applications of computer vision
Digital camera images edit 
Digital cameras generally include specialized digital image processing hardware   either dedicated chips or added circuitry on other chips   to convert the raw data from their image sensor into a color corrected image in a standard image file format  Additional post processing techniques increase edge sharpness or color saturation to create more naturally looking images 

Film edit 
Westworld        was the first feature film to use the digital image processing to pixellate photography to simulate an android s point of view              Image processing is also vastly used to produce the chroma key effect that replaces the background of actors with natural or artistic scenery 

Face detection edit 
Face detection process
Face detection can be implemented with mathematical morphology  the discrete cosine transform  DCT   and horizontal projection 
General method with feature based method
The feature based method of face detection is using skin tone  edge detection  face shape  and feature of a face  like eyes  mouth  etc   to achieve face detection  The skin tone  face shape  and all the unique elements that only the human face have can be described as features 
Process explanation

Given a batch of face images  first  extract the skin tone range by sampling face images  The skin tone range is just a skin filter 
Structural similarity index measure  SSIM  can be applied to compare images in terms of extracting the skin tone 
Normally  HSV or RGB color spaces are suitable for the skin filter  E g  HSV mode  the skin tone range is                         
After filtering images with skin tone  to get the face edge  morphology and DCT are used to remove noise and fill up missing skin areas 
Opening method or closing method can be used to achieve filling up missing skin 
DCT is to avoid the object with skin like tone  Since human faces always have higher texture 
Sobel operator or other operators can be applied to detect face edge 
To position human features like eyes  using the projection and find the peak of the histogram of projection help to get the detail feature like mouth  hair  and lip 
Projection is just projecting the image to see the high frequency which is usually the feature position 
Improvement of image quality method edit 
Image quality can be influenced by camera vibration  over exposure  gray level distribution too centralized  and noise  etc  For example  noise problem can be solved by smoothing method while gray level distribution problem can be improved by histogram equalization 
Smoothing method
In drawing  if there is some dissatisfied color  taking some color around dissatisfied color and averaging them  This is an easy way to think of Smoothing method 
Smoothing method can be implemented with mask and convolution  Take the small image and mask for instance as below

Challenges edit 
Noise and Distortions  Imperfections in images due to poor lighting  limited sensors  and file compression can result in unclear images that impact accurate image conversion 
Variability in Image Quality  Variations in image quality and resolution  including blurry images and incomplete details  can hinder uniform processing across a database 
Object Detection and Recognition  Identifying and recognising objects within images  especially in complex scenarios with multiple objects and occlusions  poses a significant challenge 
Data Annotation and Labelling  Labelling diverse and multiple images for machine recognition is crucial for further processing accuracy  as incorrect identification can lead to unrealistic results 
Computational Resource Intensity  Accessing adequate computational resources for image processing can be challenging and costly  hindering progress without sufficient resources
