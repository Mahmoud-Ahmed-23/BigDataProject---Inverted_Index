							 Starfield  is one of the most anticipated video games in recent history ContentsClassical music becomes exclusiveFrom  bleeps and bloops  to symphonic musicGetting the recognition it deserves



The game  which was released on Sept           allows players to build their own character and spacecraft  travel to any one of a thousand or more planets and follow multiple story arcs 



Starfield s soundtrack is equally epic  with audio director Mark Lampert describing the game s music as a  companion to the player   with a  sense of scale  that  had to be totally readjusted   in a recent interview about Starfield s sound design 



Soundtracks for outer space have appeared in many films    Star Wars          A Space Odyssey  and  Interstellar   to name a few 



But the interactive music of  Starfield  does something different  Utilizing a palette of musical language that cultivates a contemplative soundscape  it launches the listener into the vastness of space while remaining curious  innocent and restrained  If you close your eyes  you can imagine it being performed in the concert hall 



That s exactly what happened prior to the game s release  when the London Symphony Orchestra performed the  Starfield Suite  before a sold out audience at the Alexandra Palace Theatre  one of the world s most prestigious concert halls 



As a conductor  musician and educator  I m excited about games like  Starfield  because they re drawing people to symphonic music like never before 



Classical music becomes exclusive



Before recording technology  the only way to hear music was to experience it live  Throughout early history  music functioned as an integral part of cultural life  It was played at festivals  accompanied religious services and even served as a means of communication 



During the time of the Renaissance  around the middle   th to   th centuries  there was a shift from music as function to music as art and entertainment 



Soon  live vocal and instrumental music became a form of popular entertainment  and people clamored for bigger and better sounds  In the   th century  the marriage of art  drama and music was consummated in opera  During the   th and   th centuries  instruments continued to evolve  large concert halls and opera houses were built  and composers explored new ideas that pushed boundaries 



What s now known as  symphonic music  was born  music that was performed by a symphony orchestra  A symphony is not only a large group of musicians  but it is also a piece of music written by a composer containing multiple movements 



To hear a performance of Beethoven s Fifth Symphony  you had to witness a symphony orchestra play it  and crowds clamored to gain entry to concert halls hear the newest and most acclaimed composers  works 



During the   th and early   th centuries  however  a set of social rules calcified around this music  how to listen  what to wear  where to sit and when to applaud  As tastes and technologies began to change in the late   th century  the masses were drawn to new forms of music like jazz  Concert halls  meanwhile  became the realm of high culture  high art and high society 



A clear divide between popular music and what became known as  classical  music emerged  That divide still exists today 



Many argue that the classical music world is no longer accessible to most people   it s seen as too intimidating and too stuffy  with works that are too long and tickets that are too expensive  Meanwhile  symphony orchestras around the world are scrambling to diversify their music and ranks within a tradition and culture that was long reserved for the highly educated  wealthy and white 



With symphonies working to be more inclusive in their music education and program offerings  I see video games as a key way to bridge this divide  









From  bleeps and bloops  to symphonic music



Due to limitations in hardware  early video games utilized synthesized  bleeps and bloops   However  these constraints spurred programmers to think about creative ways to make games more immersive through sound 



Today  video games do not have the same limitations  Composers have the agency to create soundscapes that utilize the most advanced hardware and software  and they can employ some of the best musicians in the world to record award winning soundtracks 



In a      interview  video game composer and conductor Eimear Noone said   More young people listen to orchestral music through their game consoles today than have ever listened to orchestral music in the history of music  



She s probably right  There are over   billion gamers around the world  and people between the ages of    and    spend the most time playing video games  A      poll conducted by the U K  s Royal Philharmonic Orchestra found that more young people are exposed to classical music through video games than through attending live performances 



The fusion of advanced technology and scholarship has forged worlds like those found in the  Assassin s Creed  franchise  which can act as time machines that allow players to explore ancient Greece  with historically informed soundtracks accompanying them on their journeys 



In Activision s  Sekiro  Shadows Die Twice   composer Yuka Kitamura used traditional Japanese instruments to craft a sound informed by Japan s Sengoku period  the music of  Civilization IV  contains tracks influenced by composers throughout history  and many of today s most popular video game titles feature classical music 



 Thanks to video games   Boston Globe music writer A Z  Madonna wrote   I fell in love with classical music  



Getting the recognition it deserves



Today s video game music is more interactive and nonlinear than traditional concert hall and film music  This means that composers think differently when writing for games  Tools  technologies and education for composers and musicians are changing 



The increasing complexity of video games means composers are once again pushing boundaries through expanded sound palettes  Like  Starfield   many modern game titles incorporate symphonic music needed to provide the emotional and atmospheric underpinning of the game experience 



As the gaming industry continues to expand   it s projected to earn US     billion globally by        video game soundtracks have become more and more popular  When a game is released  music streaming platforms routinely release an accompanying soundtrack 



The classical music world and symphony orchestras may finally be catching on 



In       the BBC Proms  a daily summer concert series that features classical music in London  included video game music performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra for the first time in history  In       the Grammys recognized  Best Video Game Soundtrack  as an official category for the first time  Its inaugural winner was Stephanie Economou for her work on  Assassin s Creed Valhalla  Dawn of Ragnar k  



Today  there are a number of symphonic concert series   GameOn   Game Concerts  Distant Worlds and VGL   that feature live video game music performed by top orchestras 



 Starfield  will be marked by beautiful graphics  interactive game play and a compelling story  but holding it together will be the gravity of its sonic landscape  Video game music has come a long way from its first  bleeps and bloops   Symphonic music will continue to accompany players  video game journeys  and like  Starfield   the sky is no longer the limit
