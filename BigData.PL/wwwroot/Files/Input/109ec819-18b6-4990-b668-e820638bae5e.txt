Founding edit 
  th century edit 
James Russell Lowell  the first editor of The Atlantic
In the autumn of       Moses Dresser Phillips  a publisher from Boston  created The Atlantic Monthly  The plan for the magazine was launched at a dinner party  which was described in a letter by Phillips 

I must tell you about a little dinner party I gave about two weeks ago  It would be proper  perhaps  to state the origin of it was a desire to confer with my literary friends on a somewhat extensive literary project  the particulars of which I shall reserve till you come  But to the Party  My invitations included only R  W  Emerson  H  W  Longfellow  J  R  Lowell  Mr  Motley  the  Dutch Republic  man   O  W  Holmes  Mr  Cabot  and Mr  Underwood  our literary man  Imagine your uncle as the head of such a table  with such guests  The above named were the only ones invited  and they were all present  We sat down at three P M   and rose at eight  The time occupied was longer by about four hours and thirty minutes than I am in the habit of consuming in that kind of occupation  but it was the richest time intellectually by all odds that I have ever had  Leaving myself and  literary man  out of the group  I think you will agree with me that it would be difficult to duplicate that number of such conceded scholarship in the whole country besides    Each one is known alike on both sides of the Atlantic  and is read beyond the limits of the English language             
At that dinner he announced his idea for the magazine 

Mr  Cabot is much wiser than I am  Dr  Holmes can write funnier verses than I can  Mr  Motley can write history better than I  Mr  Emerson is a philosopher and I am not  Mr  Lowell knows more of the old poets than I  But none of you knows the American people as well as I do             
The Atlantic     s first issue was published in November       and quickly gained notability as one of the finest magazines in the English speaking world 
In       the magazine absorbed The Galaxy  a competitor monthly magazine founded a dozen years previously by William Conant Church and his brother Francis P  Church  it had published works by Mark Twain  Walt Whitman  Ion Hanford Perdicaris and Henry James

In       the magazine published an expose on the allegations against movie director Bryan Singer that  sent Singer s career into a tailspin   It was originally contracted to Esquire magazine  but the writers moved it there due to what New York Times reporter Ben Smith described as Hearst magazines   timid  nature   There s not a lot of nuance here   Jeffrey Goldberg said   They spiked a story that should have been published in the public interest for reasons unknown
