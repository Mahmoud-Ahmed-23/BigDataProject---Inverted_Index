Resisting AI  An Anti fascist Approach to Artificial Intelligence is a book on artificial intelligence  AI  by Dan McQuillan  published in      by Bristol University Press 


Content edit 
Resisting AI takes the form of an extended essay             which contrasts optimistic visions about AI s potential by arguing that AI may best be seen as a continuation and reinforcement of bureaucratic forms of discrimination and violence  ultimately fostering authoritarian outcomes             For McQuillan  AI s promise of objective calculability is antithetical to an egalitarian and just society                        McQuillan uses the expression  AI violence  to describe how        based on opaque algorithms        various actors can discriminate against categories of people in accessing jobs  loans  medical care  and other benefits            
The book suggests that AI has a political resonance with soft eugenic approaches to the valuation of life by modern welfare states             and that AI exhibits eugenic features in its underlying logic  as well as in its technical operations              The parallel is with historical eugenicists achieving saving to the state by sterilizing defectives so the state would not have to care for their offspring            
The analysis of McQuillan goes beyond the known critique of AI systems fostering precarious labour markets  addressing  necropolitics   the politics of who is entitled to live  and who to die                        Although McQuillan offers a brief history of machine learning at the beginning of the book        with its need for  hidden and undercompensated labour              he is concerned more with the social impacts of AI rather than with its technical aspects                        McQuillan sees AI as the continuation of existing bureaucratic systems that already marginalize vulnerable groups        aggravated by the fact that AI systems trained on existing data are likely to reinforce existing discriminations  e g  in attempting to optimize welfare distribution based on existing data patterns             ultimately creating a system of  self reinforcing social profiling             
In elaborating on the continuation between existing bureaucratic violence and AI  McQuillan connects to Hannah Arendt s concept of the thoughtless bureaucrat in Eichmann in Jerusalem  A Report on the Banality of Evil  which now becomes the algorithm that  lacking intent  cannot be accountable  and is thus endowed with an  algorithmic thoughtlessness             
McQuillan defends the  fascist  in the title of the work by arguing that while not all AI is fascist  this emerging technology of control may end up being deployed by fascist or authoritarian regimes              For McQuillan  AI can support the diffusion of states of exception  as a technology impossible to properly regulate and a mechanism for multiplying exceptions more widely  An example of a scenario where AI systems of surveillance could bring discrimination to a new high is the initiative to create LGBT free zones in Poland                        
Skeptical of ethical regulations to control the technology  McQuillan suggests people s councils and workers  councils  and other forms of citizens  agency to resist AI             A chapter titled  Post Machine Learning  makes an appeal for resistance via currents of thought from feminist science  standpoint theory   post normal science  extended peer communities   and new materialism  McQuillan encourages the reader to question the meaning of  objectivity  and calls for the necessity of alternative ways of knowing              Among the virtuous examples of resistance        possibly to be adopted by the AI workers themselves        McQuillan notes             the Lucas Plan of the workers of Lucas Aerospace Corporation              in which a workforce declared redundant took control  reorienting the enterprise toward useful products              
The work of McQuillan             

warns against  watered down forms of engagement  with AI  such as citizen juries  which superficially look like democratic deliberation
but may actually obscure important decisions about AI that are outside the purview of the engagement situation  McQuillan            
In an interview about the book  McQuillan defines himself as an  AI abolitionist              

Reception edit 
The book is praised for  masterfully
disassembles AI as an epistemological  social  and political paradigm              and for his examination of how most of the data that is fed into  privatized AI infrastructure is  amputated              from context or embodied experience and ultimately processed through crowdsourcing  
On the critical side  a review in the academic journal Justice  Power and Resistance took exception to the  nightmarish visions of Big Brother  offered by McQuillan  and argued that while many elements of AI may pose concern  a critique should not be based on a caricature of what AI is  concluding that McQuillan s work is  less of a theory and more of a Manifesto              Another review notes  a disconnect between the technical aspects of AI and the socio political analysis McQuillan provides             
Although the book was published before the ChatGPT and large language model debate heated up  the book has not lost relevance to the AI discussion              It is noted             for suggesting a link between beliefs in artificial intelligence and beliefs in a racialised and gendered visions of intelligence overall  whereby a certain type of rational  measurable intelligence is privileged  leading to  historical notions of hierarchies of being                
The blog Reboot praised McQuillan for offering a theory of harm of AI  why AI could end up hurting people and society  that does not just encourage tackling in isolation specific predicted problems with AI centric systems  bias  non inclusiveness  exploitativeness  environmental destructiveness  opacity  and non contestability             
For             educational policies could also look at AI following the reading of McQuillan   

In his book Resisting AI  Dan McQuillan argues that  When we re thinking about the actuality of AI  we can t separate the calculations in the code from the social context of its application       McQuillan s particular concern is how many contemporary applications of AI are amplifying existing inequalities and injustices as well as deepening social divisions and instabilities  His book makes a powerful case for anticipating these effects and actively resisting them for the good of societies 
Videos                         and podcasts                                    with an interest in AI and emerging technology have discussed the book
