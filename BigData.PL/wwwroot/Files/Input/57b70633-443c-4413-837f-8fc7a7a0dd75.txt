Main article  History of Stanford University
Stanford University was founded in      by Leland and Jane Stanford as a tribute to the memory of their only child  Leland Stanford Jr  The university officially opened in      on the Stanfords  former Palo Alto farm  Modeled after the great Eastern universities  specifically Cornell University in Ithaca  New York  Stanford was often referred to as the  Cornell of the West  in its early years  This comparison was largely due to a significant portion of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates  including its first president  David Starr Jordan  and its second president  John Casper Branner  Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible  non sectarian  and inclusive of women and men  Cornell is recognized as one of the first American universities to embrace this progressive approach to education  and Stanford quickly followed suit  solidifying its commitment to these ideals

From an architectural perspective  the Stanfords sought to distinguish their university by emulating the style of English university buildings while also incorporating elements of local California heritage  They specified in the founding grant that the buildings should  be like the old adobe houses of the early Spanish days  they will be one storied  they will have deep window seats and open fireplaces  and the roofs will be covered with the familiar dark red tiles               The Stanfords also hired renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted  who previously designed the Cornell campus  to design the Stanford campus             
When Leland Stanford died in       the continued existence of the university was put in jeopardy due to a federal lawsuit against his estate  but Jane Stanford insisted the university remain in operation throughout the financial crisis                          The university suffered major damage from the      San Francisco earthquake  most of the damage was repaired  but a new library and gymnasium were demolished  and some original features of Memorial Church and the Quad were never restored              During the early   th century  the university added four professional graduate schools  Stanford University School of Medicine was established in      when the university acquired Cooper Medical College in San Francisco              it moved to the Stanford campus in

In the     s  Stanford intentionally reduced and restricted Jewish admissions  and for decades  denied and dismissed claims from students  parents  and alumni that they were doing so              Stanford issued its first institutional apology to the Jewish community in      after an internal task force confirmed that the university deliberately discriminated against Jewish applicants  while also misleading those who expressed concerns  including students  parents  alumni  and the ADL                          Stanford was once considered a school for  the wealthy               but controversies in later decades damaged its reputation  The      Stanford prison experiment was criticized as unethical              and the misuse of government funds from      resulted in severe penalties for the school s research funding                          and the resignation of President Donald Kennedy in                  
In the     s  Stanford rose from a regional university to one of the most prestigious in the United States   when it appeared on lists of the  top ten  universities in America    This swift rise to performance  was  understood at the time as related directly to the university s defense contracts                 Wallace Sterling was the President from      to      and he oversaw the growth of Stanford from a financially troubled regional university to a financially sound  internationally recognized academic powerhouse   the Harvard of the West               Achievements during Sterling s tenure included
