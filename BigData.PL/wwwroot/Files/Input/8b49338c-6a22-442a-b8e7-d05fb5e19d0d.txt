Learn About Complexities
To have a measure of the efficiency of algorithms we use asymptotic Notations which are used to describe the behavior of algorithms in terms of their time Complexity and space Complexity as the input size grows  It includes many different notations such as  
Big O Notation         O  Omega Notation            Theta Notation               Understand and Implement Data Structures and AlgorithmsOnce you ve got the language covered  you can move toward learning fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms   Learn and understand key data structures like arrays  linked lists  stacks  and queues  and learn algorithms such as sorting and searching  At this stage  you should also focus on implementing these concepts yourself through hands on coding to build a strong foundation in DSA 
Array Matrix GridStringsRecursionStack Queue Linked List HeapHashingTreeGraphSliding Window TechniqueTwo Pointer Technique Searching Algorithms Sorting AlgorithmsDynamic ProgrammingGreedy AlgorithmsBacktracking   Explore Libraries  Packages and Their UsesAfter mastering the fundamentals  move on to discovering libraries and how they work  Many programming languages offer built in libraries or frameworks that provide efficient implementations of data structures and algorithms  Which can help you save time and improve your coding efficiency  allowing you to focus on solving problems rather than reimplementing common structures  
Libraries in C  Standard Template Library   STL     STL is the most commonly used library for DSA in C   that provides a collection of generic data structures and algorithms used for solving problems related to data structures  algorithms  and containersLibraries in JAVAJava utility package  The java util package provides a rich set of data structures and algorithms that can be used for implementing various Data Structures and Algorithms  Python LibrariesCollections Module   The collections module in Python provides specialized container datatypes that can be extremely useful for DSA  Heapq Module   The heapq module in Python provides an implementation of a heap  binary heap  and functions to operate on it     Solve Challenging Problems to Master Advanced  Now it s time to Master DSA by solving challenging problems  Explore the SDE Sheet prepared by experts at Geeksfoprgeeks  This SDE sheet is a comprehensive guide to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms  specifically designed for Software Development Engineering  SDE  interviews  It helps structure your preparation  covering essential topics and providing key problems to practice for technical interviews
