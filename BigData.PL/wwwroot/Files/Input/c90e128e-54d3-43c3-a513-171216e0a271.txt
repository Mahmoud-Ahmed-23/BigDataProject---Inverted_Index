One of the major revelations of the evening was the recent discovery of the tomb of Prince Weser Ef Ra in Saqqara  The prince was the son of King Userkaf  the first ruler of Egypt s Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom  Hawass noted that the find includes an extraordinary false door carved from pink granite  measuring     meters in height and      meters in width unprecedented in scale  The door is inscribed with the prince s titles  including        Hereditary Prince                Governor of Buto and Nekhbet                Royal Scribe                Vizier         and        Judge        
Another fascinating discovery discussed was a statue grouping of King Djoser  his wife  and their ten daughters  According to initial studies  the statues were originally placed in a chamber adjacent to Djoser s iconic Step Pyramid and were relocated to Weser Ef Ra s tomb during a later period

 This city is the largest administrative and industrial settlement from the height of the Egyptian Empire   Hawass explained   Entire houses and city blocks have been uncovered offering a unique window into daily life during the New Kingdom  
Hawass concluded the evening with a lively Q amp A session  fielding questions about modern excavation techniques  the mysteries of ancient Egyptian civilization  and the future of archaeological research in the region  His enthusiasm  combined with the magnitude of recent and upcoming discoveries  left the audience eager for what      might reveal beneath Egypt s timeless sands
