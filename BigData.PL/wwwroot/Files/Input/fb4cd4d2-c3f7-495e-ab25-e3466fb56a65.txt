The Doctors  Syndicate agreed on Friday to hold a partial strike twice a week starting February as a form of escalation to push for reforms within the public healthcare sector 
The syndicate already carried out partial strikes on   and   January  where the level of participation was at least      according to syndicate figures 
In a meeting between members of the Doctors  General Syndicate and other sub syndicates on Friday  doctors agreed to begin their partial strike in February  with a plan to strike three days a week in March  Rapporteur of the Media Committee of the Doctors  Syndicate Hossam Kamal said that should the partial strike remain fruitless  the doctors intend to upgrade their strike to an open ended one after March 
The Doctors  Syndicate decided it will not take part in the partial strike organised by the Medical Professionals Union on Sunday and Monday  Kamal said  The union includes representatives of doctors  dentists  veterinarians  pharmacists and nursing staff  however  Kamal said that the union s decision is not binding to the syndicates represented within 
 The Doctors  General Syndicate and the sub syndicates decided we would rather wait and properly prepare for the strike   Kamal said   That doesn t mean  however  that we don t support the Medical Professionals Union s strike and wish it succeeds  
The syndicate is starting an awareness campaign regarding the degree of effectiveness and legality of collective resignations among doctors  Kamal said 
 Should doctors nationwide welcome the idea  we will begin implementing it starting March   he added  The collective resignations are meant to be another form of escalation to push the authorities to carry out the syndicate s demands 
Doctors have been trying to push for the ratification of the draft Staff Law  which would organise financial  technical and administrative matters such as training  promotions and working hours for all professionals in the public healthcare sector  A bulk of doctors  incomes is made up of bonuses and incentives  however  doctors demand that pay raises increase their fixed salary  which is what the draft Staff Law would achieve if passed 
The Doctors  Syndicate agreed on Friday to halt all negotiations with the Ministry of Health until the ministry demonstrates its  seriousness  with regards to passing the bill 
On    December  the cabinet approved a law that would raise salaries for all medical professionals  however  doctors were not pleased since the raise would increase incentives rather than the fixed salary 
 We would understand if the cabinet s law is an immediate sedative for doctors   Kamal said   But if they want to pass it instead of the draft Staff Law  this would be unacceptable  
Ministry of Health Spokesman Mohamed Fathallah said that the ministry is yet to  study  the Doctors  Syndicate s decisions and respond to them 
In addition to the passing the Staff Law  doctors are also demanding an improvement in security conditions in hospitals  by demanding that a law be passed to enforce harsher penalties on anyone who commits an act of aggression against doctors or hospitals  and that the state budget for health be raised 
In       doctors staged a partial strike which lasted longer than    days and ended with the stipulation that the bill would soon be passed  Subsequently  the draft Staff Law was handed to the Shura Council in       but the legislature did not survive to pass it 
Like the previous strikes  the upcoming one is set to include all hospitals and medical institutions that operate within the public healthcare sector 
Typically  the strike affects all non emergency medical services and outpatient clinics  However  the emergency department  emergency operations  kidney dialysis  intensive care units and incubators continue to run normally
