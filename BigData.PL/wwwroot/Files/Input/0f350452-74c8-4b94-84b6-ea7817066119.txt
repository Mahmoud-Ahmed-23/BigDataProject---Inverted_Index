Samuel Butler    December           June       was an English novelist and critic  best known for the satirical utopian novel Erewhon        and the semi autobiographical novel  The Way of All Flesh  published posthumously in      with substantial revisions and published in its original form in      as Ernest Pontifex or The Way of All Flesh   Both novels have remained in print since their initial publication  In other studies he examined Christian orthodoxy  evolutionary thought  and Italian art  and made prose translations of the Iliad and Odyssey that are still consulted                       


Early life edit 
Samuel Butler s birthplace and childhood home
Butler was born on   December                 at the rectory in the village of Langar  Nottinghamshire  His father was Rev  Thomas Butler  son of Dr  Samuel Butler  then headmaster of Shrewsbury School and later Bishop of Lichfield             Dr  Butler was the son of a tradesman and descended from a line of yeomen  despite his family s social class  his scholarly aptitude was recognised at a young age  and he was sent to Rugby and Cambridge  where he distinguished himself 
His only son  Thomas  wished to go into the Navy but succumbed to paternal pressure and entered the Anglican clergy  in which he led an undistinguished career  in contrast to his father s  Samuel s immediate family created for him an oppressive home environment  chronicled in The Way of All Flesh   Thomas Butler  states one critic   to make up for having been a servile son  became a bullying father             
Samuel Butler s relations with his parents  especially with his father  were largely antagonistic  His education began at home and included frequent beatings  as was not uncommon at the time  Samuel wrote later that his parents were  brutal and stupid by nature              He later recorded that his father  never liked me  nor I him  from my earliest recollections I can call to mind no time when I did not fear him and dislike him     I have never passed a day without thinking of him many times over as the man who was sure to be against me              Under his parents  influence  he was set on course to follow his father into the priesthood 
He was sent to Shrewsbury at age twelve  where he did not enjoy the hard life under its headmaster Benjamin Hall Kennedy  whom he later drew as  Dr  Skinner  in The Way of All Flesh             Then  in       he went up to St John s College  Cambridge  where he obtained a first in Classics in                  The graduate society of St John s is named the Samuel Butler Room  SBR  in his honour 

Career edit 
Butler at the age of         
After Cambridge  he went to live in a low income parish in London           as preparation for his ordination into the Anglican clergy  there he discovered that infant baptism made no apparent difference to the morals and behaviour of his peers and began questioning his faith  This experience would later serve as inspiration for his work The Fair Haven  Correspondence with his father about the issue failed to set his mind at peace  instead inciting his father s wrath  As a result  in September       on the ship Roman Emperor             he emigrated to New Zealand 
Butler went there  like many early British settlers of materially privileged origins  to maximise distance between himself and his family  He wrote of his arrival and life as a sheep farmer on Mesopotamia Station in A First Year in Canterbury Settlement         and he made a handsome profit when he sold his farm  but his chief achievement during his time there consisted of drafts and source material for much of his masterpiece Erewhon 
Erewhon revealed Butler s long interest in Darwin s theories of biological evolution  In       four years after Darwin published On the Origin of Species  the editor of a New Zealand newspaper  The Press  published a letter captioned  Darwin among the Machines   written by Butler  but signed Cellarius  It compares human evolution to machine evolution  prophesying that machines would eventually replace humans in the supremacy of the earth   In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race              The letter raises many of the themes now debated by proponents of the technological singularity  for example that computers evolve much faster than humans and that we are racing toward an unknowable future through explosive technological change 
Butler also spent time criticizing Darwin  partly because he  in the shadow of a previous Samuel Butler  believed that Darwin had not sufficiently acknowledged his grandfather Erasmus Darwin s contribution to his theory             
Butler returned to England in       settling in rooms in Clifford s Inn  near Fleet Street   where he lived for the rest of his life  In       the Utopian novel Erewhon appeared anonymously  causing some speculation as to who the author was  When Butler revealed himself  Erewhon made him a well known figure  more because of this speculation than for its literary merits  which have been undisputed 
He was less successful when he lost money investing in a Canadian steamship company and in the Canada Tanning Extract Company  in which he and his friend Charles Pauli were made nominal directors  In      Butler went to Canada   fighting fraud of every kind  in an attempt to save the company  which collapsed  reducing his own capital to                    
In      his grandfather Dr  Butler had left Samuel property at Whitehall in Abbey Foregate  Shrewsbury  so long as he survived his own father and his aunt  Dr  Butler s daughter Harriet Lloyd  While at Cambridge in      he sold the Whitehall mansion and six acres to his cousin Thomas Bucknall Lloyd  but kept the remaining land surrounding the mansion  When in the     s his old Shrewsbury School proposed to relocate to a site at Whitehall  Butler publicly opposed it and the school ultimately moved elsewhere  His aunt died in      and his father s death in      resolved his financial problems for the last    years of his own life  The land at Whitehall was sold for housing development  he laid out and named four roads   Bishop and Canon Streets after his grandfather s and father s clerical titles  Clifford Street after his London home  and Alfred Street in gratitude to his clerk             
Butler indulged himself  holidaying in Italy every summer and while there  producing his works on the Italian landscape and art  His close interest in the art of the Sacri Monti is reflected in Alps and Sanctuaries of Piedmont and the Canton Ticino        and Ex Voto         He wrote a number of other books  including a less successful sequel  Erewhon Revisited  His semi autobiographical novel  The Way of All Flesh  did not appear in print until after his death  as he considered its tone of satirical attack on Victorian morality too contentious at the time 

Death edit 
Butler died on    June       aged     in a nursing home             in St  John s Wood Road  London              By his wish  he was cremated at Woking Crematorium and by differing accounts  his ashes were dispersed or buried in an unmarked grave                         
The Way of All Flesh was published after Butler s death by his literary executor  R  A  Streatfeild  in       This version  however  altered Butler s text in many ways and cut important material  The manuscript was edited by Daniel F  Howard as Ernest Pontifex or The Way of All Flesh  Butler s original title  and published for the first time in      

Sexuality edit 
Butler s sexuality has been the subject of academic speculation and debate              Butler never married  although for years he made regular visits to a woman  Lucie Dumas  Herbert Sussman  having arrived at the conclusion that Butler was homosexual  opined that Butler s sexual association with Dumas was merely an outlet for his  intense same sex desire   Sussman s theory calls Butler s assumption of  bachelorhood  merely a means to retain middle class respectability in the absence of matrimony  he observes that there is no evidence of Butler s having any  genital contact with other men   but alleges that the  temptations of overstepping the line strained his close male relationships              
His first significant male friendship was with the young Charles Pauli  son of a German businessman in London  whom Butler met in New Zealand  They returned to England together in      and took neighbouring apartments in Clifford s Inn  Butler had made a large profit from the sale of his New Zealand farm and undertook to finance Pauli s study of law by paying him a regular sum  which Butler continued to do long after the friendship had cooled  until Butler had spent all his savings  On Pauli s death in       Butler was shocked to learn that Pauli had benefited from similar arrangements with other men and had died wealthy  but without leaving Butler anything in his will                         
After       Butler became close friends with Henry Festing Jones  whom he persuaded to give up his job as a solicitor to be his personal literary assistant and travelling companion  at a salary of      a year  Although Jones kept his own lodgings at Barnard s Inn  the two men saw each other daily until Butler s death in       collaborating on music and writing projects in the daytime  and attending concerts and theatres in the evenings  they also frequently toured Italy and other favorite parts of Europe together  After Butler s death  Jones edited Butler s notebooks for publication and published his own biography of him in                  
Another friendship was with Hans Rudolf Faesch  a Swiss student who stayed with Butler and Jones in London for two years  improving his English  before departing for Singapore  Both Butler and Jones wept when they saw him off at the railway station in early       and Butler subsequently wrote an emotional poem   In Memoriam H  R  F                instructing his literary agent to offer it for publication to several leading English magazines  However  once the Oscar Wilde trial began in the spring of that year  with revelations of homosexual behaviour among the literati  Butler feared being associated with the widely reported scandal and in a panic wrote to all the magazines  withdrawing his poem             
Some critics  beginning with Malcolm Muggeridge in The Earnest Atheist  A Study of Samuel Butler         concluded that Butler was a sublimated or repressed homosexual and that his lifelong status as an  incarnate bachelor  was comparable to that of his writer contemporaries Walter Pater  Henry James  and E  M  Forster  also thought to be closeted homosexuals 

Philosophy and personal thought edit 
Whether in his satire or fiction  Butler s studies on the evidence for Christianity  his works on evolutionary thought  or in his miscellaneous other writings  a consistent theme runs through  stemming largely from his personal struggle against the stifling of his own nature by his parents  which led him to seek more general principles of growth  development  and purpose   What concerned him was to establish his nature  his aspirations  and their fulfillment upon a philosophic basis  to identify them with the nature  the aspirations  the fulfillment of all humanity   and  more than that  with the fulfillment of the universe     His struggle became generalized  symbolic  tremendous             
The form that this search took was principally philosophical and   given the interests of the day   biological   Satirist  novelist  artist  and critic that he was  he was primarily a philosopher   and in particular  a philosopher who looked for biological foundations for his work   His biology was a bridge to a philosophy of life  which sought a scientific basis for religion  and endowed a naturalistically conceived universe with a soul              Indeed   philosophical writer  was ultimately the self description Butler chose as most fitting to his work             

Homer edit 
Butler developed a theory that the Odyssey came from the pen of a young Sicilian woman  and that the scenes of the poem reflected the coast of Sicily  especially the territory of Trapani  and its nearby islands  He described his evidence for this in The Authoress of the Odyssey        and in the introduction and footnotes to his prose translation of the Odyssey         Robert Graves elaborated on the hypothesis in his novel Homer s Daughter 
Butler argued in a lecture entitled  The Humour of Homer   delivered at The Working Men s College in London        that Homer s deities in the Iliad are like humans  but  without the virtue   and that he  must have desired his listeners not to take them seriously   Butler translated the Iliad         His other works include Shakespeare s Sonnets Reconsidered         a theory that the sonnets  if rearranged  tell a story about a homosexual affair 

Theology edit 
In a book of essays published after his death  entitled God the Known and God the Unknown  Samuel Butler argued for the existence of a single  corporeal deity  declaring belief in an incorporeal deity to be essentially the same as atheism  He asserted that this  body  of God was  in fact  composed of the bodies of all living things on earth  a belief that may be classed as  panzoism   He later changed his views  and decided that God was composed not only of all living things  but of all non living things as well  He argued  however  that  some vaster Person  may  loom     out behind our God  and     stand in relation to him as he to us  And behind this vaster and more unknown God there may be yet another  and another  and another              

Heredity edit 
Butler argued that each organism was not  in fact  distinct from its parents  Instead  he asserted that each being was merely an extension of its parents at a later stage of evolution   Birth   he once quipped   has been made too much of              

Evolution edit 
Butler wrote four books on evolution  Life and Habit  Evolution  Old and New  Unconscious Memory  and Luck  or Cunning  As the Main Means of Organic Modification   Butler accepted evolution but rejected Darwin s theory of natural selection              In his book Evolution  Old and New         he accused Darwin of borrowing heavily from Buffon  Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck  while playing down these influences and giving them little credit                                      In       the biologist Vernon Kellogg summed up Butler s views 

Butler  though strongly anti Darwinian  that is  anti natural selection and anti Charles Darwin  is not anti evolutionist  He professes  indeed  to be very much of an evolutionist  and in particular one who has taken it upon his shoulders to reinstate Buffon and Erasmus Darwin  and  as a follower of these two  Lamarck  in their rightful place as the most believable explainers of the factors and method of evolution  His evolution belief is a sort of Butlerized Lamarckism  tracing back originally to Buffon and Erasmus Darwin             
Historian Peter J  Bowler has described Butler as a defender of neo Lamarckian evolution  Bowler noted that  Butler began to see in Lamarckism the prospect of retaining an indirect form of the design argument  Instead of creating from without  God might exist within the process of living development  represented by its innate creativity                          
Butler s writings on evolution were criticised by scientists                          Critics have pointed out that Butler admitted to be writing entertainment rather than science  and his writings were not taken seriously by most professional biologists                          Butler s books were negatively reviewed in Nature by George Romanes and Alfred Russel Wallace  Romanes stated that Butler s views on evolution had no basis in science                         
Gregory Bateson often mentioned Butler and saw value in some of his ideas  calling him  the ablest contemporary critic of Darwinian evolution   He noted Butler s insight into the efficiencies of habit formation  patterns of behaviour and mental processes  in adapting to an environment 

 M ind and pattern as the explanatory principles  which  above all  required investigation  were pushed out of biological thinking in the later evolutionary theories  which were developed in the mid nineteenth century by Darwin  Huxley  etc  There were still some naughty boys  like Samuel Butler  who said that mind could not be ignored in this way   but they were weak voices  and  incidentally  they never looked at organisms  I don t think Butler ever looked at anything except his own cat  but he still knew more about evolution than some of the more conventional thinkers             
Music edit 
In Ernest Pontifex or The Way of All Flesh  protagonist Ernest Pontifex says that he had been trying all his life to like modern music but succeeded less and less as he grew older  On being asked when he considers modern music to have begun  he says   with Sebastian Bach   Butler liked only Handel  and in a letter to Miss Savage said   I only want Handel s Oratorios  I would have said and things of that sort  but there are no  things of that sort  except Handel s               With Henry Festing Jones  Butler composed choral works that Eric Blom characterised as  imitation Handel   although with satirical texts  Two of the works they collaborated on were the cantatas Narcissus  private rehearsal       published        and Ulysses  published posthumously in        both for solo voices  chorus  and orchestra              George Bernard Shaw wrote in a private letter that the music was invested with  a ridiculously complete command of the Handelian manner and technique               Around      Butler was engaged as music critic by The Drawing Room Gazette  From      he took counterpoint lessons with W  S  Rockstro             

Legacy and influence edit 
Butler s friend Henry Festing Jones wrote the authoritative biography  the two volume Samuel Butler  Author of Erewhon              A Memoir  commonly known as Jones s Memoir   published in       and reissued by HardPress Publishing in                   Project Gutenberg             hosts a shorter  Sketch  by Jones  first published in      in The Humour of Homer and Other Essays             and reissued in its own volume      by Jonathan Cape as Samuel Butler  A Sketch  The most recent biography of Butler is Peter Raby s Samuel Butler  A Biography  Hogarth Press        University of Iowa Press        
Butler belonged to no literary school and spawned no followers in his lifetime  He was a serious but amateur student of the subjects he undertook  especially religious orthodoxy and evolutionary thought  and his controversial assertions effectively shut him out from both the opposing factions of church and science that played such a large role in late Victorian cultural life   In those days one was either a religionist or a Darwinian  but he was neither             
His influence on literature  such as it was  came through The Way of All Flesh  which Butler completed in the     s  but left unpublished to protect his family  yet the novel   begun in      and not touched after       was so modern when it was published in       that it may be said to have started a new school   particularly for its use of psychoanalysis in fiction  which  his treatment of Ernest Pontifex  the hero  foreshadows             
Sue Zemka writes that  Among science fiction writers  The Book of the Machines has a canonical status  for it originates the conceit by which machines develop intelligent capacities and enslave mankind   For example  in Frank Herbert s Dune the  Butlerian Jihad     in universe ancient revolt against  thinking machines  that resulted in their prohibition    is named after Butler             
The English novelist Aldous Huxley acknowledged the influence of Erewhon on his novel Brave New World  Huxley s Utopian counterpart to Brave New World  Island  also refers prominently to Erewhon  In From Dawn to Decadence  Jacques Barzun asks   Could a man do more to bewilder the public
