Decision making process conducted with varying degrees of human oversight
Automated decision making  ADM  involves the use of data  machines and algorithms to make decisions in a range of contexts  including public administration  business  health  education  law  employment  transport  media and entertainment  with varying degrees of human oversight or intervention  ADM involves large scale data from a range of sources  such as databases  text  social media  sensors  images or speech  that is processed using various technologies including computer software  algorithms  machine learning  natural language processing  artificial intelligence  augmented intelligence and robotics  The increasing use of automated decision making systems  ADMS  across a range of contexts presents many benefits and challenges to human society requiring consideration of the technical  legal  ethical  societal  educational  economic and health consequences                                  


Overview edit 
There are different definitions of ADM based on the level of automation involved  Some definitions suggests ADM involves decisions made through purely technological means without human input             such as the EU s General Data Protection Regulation  Article      However  ADM technologies and applications can take many forms ranging from decision support systems that make recommendations for human decision makers to act on  sometimes known as augmented intelligence            or  shared decision making              to fully automated decision making processes that make decisions on behalf of individuals or organizations without human involvement             Models used in automated decision making systems can be as simple as checklists and decision trees through to artificial intelligence and deep neural networks  DNN  
Since the     s computers have gone from being able to do basic processing to having the capacity to undertake complex  ambiguous and highly skilled tasks such as image and speech recognition  gameplay  scientific and medical analysis and inferencing across multiple data sources  ADM is now being increasingly deployed across all sectors of society and many diverse domains from entertainment to transport 
An ADM system  ADMS  may involve multiple decision points  data sets  and technologies  ADMT  and may sit within a larger administrative or technical system such as a criminal justice system or business process 

Data edit 
Automated decision making involves using data as input to be analyzed within a process  model  or algorithm or for learning and generating new models             ADM systems may use and connect a wide range of data types and sources depending on the goals and contexts of the system  for example  sensor data for self driving cars and robotics  identity data for security systems  demographic and financial data for public administration  medical records in health  criminal records in law  This can sometimes involve vast amounts of data and computing power 

Data quality edit 
The quality of the available data and its ability to be used in ADM systems is fundamental to the outcomes  It is often highly problematic for many reasons  Datasets are often highly variable  corporations or governments may control large scale data  restricted for privacy or security reasons  incomplete  biased  limited in terms of time or coverage  measuring and describing terms in different ways  and many other issues 
For machines to learn from data  large corpora are often required  which can be challenging to obtain or compute  however  where available  they have provided significant breakthroughs  for example  in diagnosing chest X rays            

ADM technologies edit 
Automated decision making technologies  ADMT  are software coded digital tools that automate the translation of input data to output data  contributing to the function of automated decision making systems             There are a wide range of technologies in use across ADM applications and systems

Machine learning edit 
Main article  Machine learning
Machine learning  ML  involves training computer programs through exposure to large data sets and examples to learn from experience and solve problems             Machine learning can be used to generate and analyse data as well as make algorithmic calculations and has been applied to image and speech recognition  translations  text  data and simulations  While machine learning has been around for some time  it is becoming increasingly powerful due to recent breakthroughs in training deep neural networks  DNNs   and dramatic increases in data storage capacity and computational power with GPU coprocessors and cloud computing            
Machine learning systems based on foundation models run on deep neural networks and use pattern matching to train a single huge system on large amounts of general data such as text and images  Early models tended to start from scratch for each new problem however since the early     s many are able to be adapted to new problems             Examples of these technologies include Open AI s DALL E  an image creation program  and their various GPT language models  and Google s PaLM language model program 

Applications edit 
ADM is being used to replace or augment human decision making by both public and private sector organisations for a range of reasons including to help increase consistency  improve efficiency  reduce costs and enable new solutions to complex problems             

Debate edit 
Research and development are underway into uses of technology to assess argument quality                                      assess argumentative essays                         and judge debates                                                  Potential applications of these argument technologies span education and society  Scenarios to consider  in these regards  include those involving the assessment and evaluation of conversational  mathematical  scientific  interpretive  legal  and political argumentation and debate 

Law edit 
In legal systems around the world  algorithmic tools such as risk assessment instruments  RAI   are being used to supplement or replace the human judgment of judges  civil servants and police officers in many contexts              In the United States RAI are being used to generate scores to predict the risk of recidivism in pre trial detention and sentencing decisions              evaluate parole for prisoners and to predict  hot spots  for future crime                                      These scores may result in automatic effects or may be used to inform decisions made by officials within the justice system              In Canada ADM has been used since      to automate certain activities conducted by immigration officials and to support the evaluation of some immigrant and visitor applications             

Economics edit 
Automated decision making systems are used in certain computer programs to create buy and sell orders related to specific financial transactions and automatically submit the orders in the international markets  Computer programs can automatically generate orders based on predefined set of rules using trading strategies which are based on technical analyses  advanced statistical and mathematical computations  or inputs from other electronic sources 

Business edit 
Continuous auditing edit 
Continuous auditing uses advanced analytical tools to automate auditing processes  It can be utilized in the private sector by business enterprises and in the public sector by governmental organizations and municipalities              As artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to advance  accountants and auditors may make use of increasingly sophisticated algorithms which make decisions such as those involving determining what is anomalous  whether to notify personnel  and how to prioritize those tasks assigned to personnel 

Media and entertainment edit 
Digital media  entertainment platforms  and information services increasingly provide content to audiences via automated recommender systems based on demographic information  previous selections  collaborative filtering or content based filtering              This includes music and video platforms  publishing  health information  product databases and search engines  Many recommender systems also provide some agency to users in accepting recommendations and incorporate data driven algorithmic feedback loops based on the actions of the system user            
Large scale machine learning language models and image creation programs being developed by companies such as OpenAI and Google in the     s have restricted access however they are likely to have widespread application in fields such as advertising  copywriting  stock imagery and graphic design as well as other fields such as journalism and law            

Advertising edit 
Online advertising is closely integrated with many digital media platforms  websites and search engines and often involves automated delivery of display advertisements in diverse formats   Programmatic  online advertising involves automating the sale and delivery of digital advertising on websites and platforms via software rather than direct human decision making              This is sometimes known as the waterfall model which involves a sequence of steps across various systems and players  publishers and data management platforms  user data  ad servers and their delivery data  inventory management systems  ad traders and ad exchanges              There are various issues with this system including lack of transparency for advertisers  unverifiable metrics  lack of control over ad venues  audience tracking and privacy concerns              Internet users who dislike ads have adopted counter measures such as ad blocking technologies which allow users to automatically filter unwanted advertising from websites and some internet applications  In           of Australian internet users had ad blockers             

Health edit 
Deep learning AI image models are being used for reviewing x rays and detecting the eye condition macular degeneration 

Social services edit 
Governments have been implementing digital technologies to provide more efficient administration and social services since the early     s  often referred to as e government  Many governments around the world are now using automated  algorithmic systems for profiling and targeting policies and services including algorithmic policing based on risks  surveillance sorting of people such as airport screening  providing services based on risk profiles in child protection  providing employment services and governing the unemployed              A significant application of ADM in social services relates to the use of predictive analytics   eg predictions of risks to children from abuse neglect in child protection  predictions of recidivism or crime in policing and criminal justice  predictions of welfare tax fraud in compliance systems  predictions of long term unemployment in employment services  Historically these systems were based on standard statistical analyses  however from the early     s machine learning has increasingly been developed and deployed  Key issues with the use of ADM in social services include bias  fairness  accountability and explainability which refers to transparency around the reasons for a decision and the ability to explain the basis on which a machine made a decision              For example Australia s federal social security delivery agency  Centrelink  developed and implemented an automated processes for detecting and collecting debt which led to many cases of wrongful debt collection in what became known as the RoboDebt scheme             

Transport and mobility edit 
Connected and automated mobility  CAM  involves autonomous vehicles such as self driving cars and other forms of transport which use automated decision making systems to replace various aspects of human control of the vehicle              This can range from level    complete human driving  to level    completely autonomous              At level   the machine is able to make decisions to control the vehicle based on data models and geospatial mapping and real time sensors and processing of the environment  Cars with levels   to   are already available on the market in       In      The German government established an  Ethics Commission on Automated and Connected Driving  which recommended connected and automated vehicles  CAVs  be developed if the systems cause fewer accidents than human drivers  positive balance of risk   It also provided    ethical rules for the adaptation of automated and connected driving              In      the European Commission strategy on CAMs recommended that they be adopted in Europe to reduce road fatalities and lower emissions however self driving cars also raise many policy  security and legal issues in terms of liability and ethical decision making in the case of accidents  as well as privacy issues              Issues of trust in autonomous vehicles and community concerns about their safety are key factors to be addressed if AVs are to be widely adopted             

Surveillance edit 
Automated digital data collections via sensors  cameras  online transactions and social media have significantly expanded the scope  scale  and goals of surveillance practices and institutions in government and commercial sectors              As a result there has been a major shift from targeted monitoring of suspects to the ability to monitor entire populations              The level of surveillance now possible as a result of automated data collection has been described as surveillance capitalism or surveillance economy to indicate the way digital media involves large scale tracking and accumulation of data on every interaction 

Ethical and legal issues edit 
There are many social  ethical and legal implications of automated decision making systems  Concerns raised include lack of transparency and contestability of decisions  incursions on privacy and surveillance  exacerbating systemic bias and inequality due to data and algorithmic bias  intellectual property rights  the spread of misinformation via media platforms  administrative discrimination  risk and responsibility  unemployment and many others                          As ADM becomes more ubiquitous there is greater need to address the ethical challenges to ensure good governance in information societies             
ADM systems are often based on machine learning and algorithms which are not easily able to be viewed or analysed  leading to concerns that they are  black box  systems which are not transparent or accountable            
A report from Citizen Lab in Canada argues for a critical human rights analysis of the application of ADM in various areas to ensure the use of automated decision making does not result in infringements on rights  including the rights to equality and non discrimination  freedom of movement  expression  religion  and association  privacy rights and the rights to life  liberty  and security of the person             
Legislative responses to ADM include 

The European General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR   introduced in       is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union  EU   Article       enshrines the right of data subjects not to be subject to decisions  which have legal or other significant effects  being based solely on automatic individual decision making                          GDPR also includes some rules on the right to explanation however the exact scope and nature of these is currently subject to pending review by the Court of Justice of the European Union              These provisions were not first introduced in the GDPR  but have been present in a similar form across Europe since the Data Protection Directive in       and the      French law  the loi informatique et libert s           fr                   Similarly scoped and worded provisions with varying attached rights and obligations are present in the data protection laws of many other jurisdictions across the world  including Uganda  Morocco and the US state of Virginia             
Rights for the explanation of public sector automated decisions forming  algorithmic treatment  under the French loi pour une R publique num rique             
Bias edit 
ADM may incorporate algorithmic bias arising from 

Data sources  where data inputs are biased in their collection or selection            
Technical design of the algorithm  for example where assumptions have been made about how a person will behave            
Emergent bias  where the application of ADM in unanticipated circumstances creates a biased outcome            
Explainability edit 
Questions of biased or incorrect data or algorithms and concerns that some ADMs are black box technologies  closed to human scrutiny or interrogation  has led to what is referred to as the issue of explainability  or the right to an explanation of automated decisions and AI  This is also known as Explainable AI  XAI   or Interpretable AI  in which the results of the solution can be analysed and understood by humans  XAI algorithms are considered to follow three principles   transparency  interpretability and explainability 

Information asymmetry edit 
Automated decision making may increase the information asymmetry between individuals whose data feeds into the system and the platforms and decision making systems capable of inferring information from that data  On the other hand it has been observed that in financial trading the information asymmetry between two artificial intelligent agents may be much less than between two human agents or between human and machine agents              A research validated Daniel Kahneman s theory on noisy decisions by human experts in finance              It demonstrates the inherent inconsistencies in human judgments  which consequently affect the outcomes of automated decisions made by AI decision support systems  

Research fields edit 
Many academic disciplines and fields are increasingly turning their attention to the development  application and implications of ADM including business  computer sciences  human computer interaction  HCI   law  public administration  and media and communications  The automation of media content and algorithmically driven news  video and other content via search systems and platforms is a major focus of academic research in media studies             
The ACM Conference on Fairness  Accountability  and Transparency  ACM FAccT  was established in      to study transparency and explainability in the context of socio technical systems  many of which include ADM and AI
