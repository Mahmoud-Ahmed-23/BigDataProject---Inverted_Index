Biography edit 
Education edit 
Yu Chi Ho was born on March          in Shanghai  China  and left home at the age of    in      to complete his high school education in Hong Kong  In       Ho was accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and came to the U S   where he received a B S  in electrical engineering in the summer of       at the age of     Ho later reported that his initial interests were in mechanical engineering  due to a childhood experience repairing a European ornamental clock without any previous knowledge of its mechanisms  His application to MIT mechanical engineering  however  was routed to the electrical engineering department by mistake  and Ho decided to stay in the department             Ho continued his graduate studies at MIT  receiving a M S  degree in electrical engineering in      
After working for Bendix Aviation for three years  Ho moved to Harvard University in       where he completed a Ph D  in applied mathematics in       His thesis A Study of the Optimal Control of Dynamic Systems was advised by Arthur E  Bryson  Jr  and Kumpati S  Narendra 

Career edit 
After finishing his Ph D  in the spring of       Yu Chi Ho returned to Harvard in the fall of      for a teaching appointment  receiving tenure in                  and remained in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences until his retirement in       At Harvard  Ho held the title of Gordon McKay Professor of Systems Engineering  Emeritus  as well as the T  Jefferson Coolidge Chair of Applied Mathematics  Emeritus  He was also the visiting professor to the Cockrell Family Regent s Chair in Engineering at the University of Texas  Austin in       In       Ho retired from teaching duties at Harvard after    years of service and became a Research Professor  He was appointed  part time  the Chair Professor and Chief Scientist at the Center for Intelligent and Networked Systems  CFINS   Department of Automation  Tsinghua University  In his career  he has supervised    Ph D  students at Harvard and   students at Tsinghua

Personal life edit 
Ho became a naturalized citizen of the United States in       He and his wife Sophia             have three children  six grand children              and one great grandchild               They currently reside in Lexington  Massachusetts  Since April           Ho blogs on ScienceNet cn  a science blog network sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Engineering and the Academy of Sciences             

Work edit 
Control theory and optimization edit 
Yu Chi Ho s research in control theory began when he was a graduate student at MIT  His      paper time domain compensation for closed loop systems by a delay line method presented a new approach to the synthesis and analysis of closed loop systems in the time domain              Ho collaborated with Rudolf E  K lm n  a pioneer of modern control theory  Before K lm n  time series analysis and classical control theory studied the frequency domain  using harmonic analysis  especially Laplace and Fourier transforms  K lm n developed the study of the time domain using state space models  Joining K lm n  Ho showed that the state space representation  provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze dynamical systems with multiple inputs and outputs which would otherwise take multiple Laplace transforms to encode  further  the state space representation can be extended into nonlinear systems  Their paper  controllability of linear dynamic systems              developed the theory of controllability  then known as the  Kalman Bertram condition   
Together with Ho s student Robert Lee at MIT  the paper A Bayesian approach to problems in stochastic estimation and control formulated a general class of stochastic estimation and control problems from a Bayesian Decision Theoretic viewpoint             

Pattern recognition edit 
After joining the faculty of Harvard University  Ho developed the Ho Kashyap rule in pattern recognition with his first Ph D  student  Rangasami L  Kashyap                         

Game theory edit 
Turning his attention to game theory  Ho in      published the paper Differential Games and Optimal Pursuit Evasion Strategies              that proved the optimality of a proportional guidance scheme  His paper Nonzero Sum Differential Games             was an influential game theoretic study in systems and control  following earlier work by Samuel Karlin  for example 

Discrete event dynamic systems edit 
Since the     s  Ho focused on research in discrete event dynamic systems  making contributions in perturbation analysis and ordinal optimization  including the book Perturbation Analysis of Discrete Event Dynamic Systems             
and the book  Ordinal Optimization   Soft Optimization for Hard Problems   Springer
