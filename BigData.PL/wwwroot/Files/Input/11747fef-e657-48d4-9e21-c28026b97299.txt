Robotics is the interdisciplinary study and practice of the design  construction  operation  and use of robots            
Within mechanical engineering  robotics is the design and construction of the physical structures of robots  while in computer science  robotics focuses on robotic automation algorithms  Other disciplines contributing to robotics include electrical  control  software  information  electronic  telecommunication  computer  mechatronic  and materials engineering 
The goal of most robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans  Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people  such as finding survivors in unstable ruins  and exploring space  mines and shipwrecks  Others replace people in jobs that are boring  repetitive  or unpleasant  such as cleaning  monitoring  transporting  and assembling  Today  robotics is a rapidly growing field  as technological advances continue  researching  designing  and building new robots serve various practical purposes 


Robotics aspects edit 
Mechanical aspect
Electrical aspect
Software aspect
Robotics usually combines three aspects of design work to create robot systems 

Mechanical construction  a frame  form or shape designed to achieve a particular task  For example  a robot designed to travel across heavy dirt or mud might use caterpillar tracks  Origami inspired robots can sense and analyze in extreme environments             The mechanical aspect of the robot is mostly the creator s solution to completing the assigned task and dealing with the physics of the environment around it  Form follows function 
Electrical components that power and control the machinery  For example  the robot with caterpillar tracks would need some kind of power to move the tracker treads  That power comes in the form of electricity  which will have to travel through a wire and originate from a battery  a basic electrical circuit  Even petrol powered machines that get their power mainly from petrol still require an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol powered machines like cars  have batteries  The electrical aspect of robots is used for movement  through motors   sensing  where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat  sound  position  and energy status   and operation  robots need some level of electrical energy supplied to their motors and sensors in order to activate and perform basic operations 
Software  A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something  In the caterpillar track example  a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery  but would not be able to go anywhere without a program telling it to move  Programs are the core essence of a robot  it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction  but if its program is poorly structured  its performance will be very poor  or it may not perform at all   There are three different types of robotic programs  remote control  artificial intelligence  and hybrid  A robot with remote control programming has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source  typically a human being with remote control  It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics  Robots that use artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a control source  and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming  A hybrid is a form of programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions in them            


Applied robotics edit 
As many robots are designed for specific tasks  this method of classification becomes more relevant  For example  many robots are designed for assembly work  which may not be readily adaptable for other applications  They are termed  assembly robots   For seam welding  some suppliers provide complete welding systems with the robot i e  the welding equipment along with other material handling facilities like turntables  etc  as an integrated unit  Such an integrated robotic system is called a  welding robot  even though its discrete manipulator unit could be adapted to a variety of tasks  Some robots are specifically designed for heavy load manipulation  and are labeled as  heavy duty robots             
Current and potential applications include 

Manufacturing  Robots have been increasingly used in manufacturing since the     s  According to the Robotic Industries Association US data  in      the automotive industry was the main customer of industrial robots with     of total sales             In the auto industry  they can amount for more than half of the  labor   There are even  lights off  factories such as an IBM keyboard manufacturing factory in Texas that was fully automated as early as

Power source edit 
Further information  Power supply and Energy storage
The InSight lander with solar panels deployed in a cleanroom
At present  mostly  lead acid  batteries are used as a power source  Many different types of batteries can be used as a power source for robots  They range from lead acid batteries  which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy compared to silver cadmium batteries which are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive  Designing a battery powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety  cycle lifetime  and weight  Generators  often some type of internal combustion engine  can also be used  However  such designs are often mechanically complex and need fuel  require heat dissipation  and are relatively heavy  A tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely  This has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere  However  this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot  which can be difficult to manage              
Potential power sources could be 

pneumatic  compressed gases 
Solar power  using the sun s energy and converting it into electrical power 
hydraulics  liquids 
flywheel energy storage
organic garbage  through anaerobic digestion 
nuclear
Actuation edit 
Main article  Actuator
A robotic leg powered by air muscles 
Actuators are the  muscles  of a robot  the parts which convert stored energy into movement              By far the most popular actuators are electric motors that rotate a wheel or gear  and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories  There are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators  powered by electricity  chemicals  or compressed air 

Electric motors edit 
Main article  Electric motor
The vast majority of robots use electric motors  often brushed and brushless DC motors in portable robots or AC motors in industrial robots and CNC machines  These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads  and where the predominant form of motion is rotational 

Linear actuators edit 
Main article  Linear actuator
Various types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning  and often have quicker direction changes  particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics  They are typically powered by compressed and oxidized air  pneumatic actuator  or an oil  hydraulic actuator  Linear actuators can also be powered by electricity which usually consists of a motor and a leadscrew  Another common type is a mechanical linear actuator such as a rack and pinion on a car 

Series elastic actuators edit 
Series elastic actuation  SEA  relies on the idea of introducing intentional elasticity between the motor actuator and the load for robust force control  Due to the resultant lower reflected inertia  series elastic actuation improves safety when a robot interacts with the environment  e g   humans or workpieces  or during collisions              Furthermore  it also provides energy efficiency and shock absorption  mechanical filtering  while reducing excessive wear on the transmission and other mechanical components  This approach has successfully been employed in various robots  particularly advanced manufacturing robots             and walking humanoid robots                         
The controller design of a series elastic actuator is most often performed within the passivity framework as it ensures the safety of interaction with unstructured environments              Despite its remarkable stability and robustness  this framework suffers from the stringent limitations imposed on the controller which may trade off performance  The reader is referred to the following survey which summarizes the common controller architectures for SEA along with the corresponding sufficient passivity conditions              One recent study has derived the necessary and sufficient passivity conditions for one of the most common impedance control architectures  namely velocity sourced SEA              This work is of particular importance as it drives the non conservative passivity bounds in an SEA scheme for the first time which allows a larger selection of control gains 

Air muscles edit 
Main article  Pneumatic artificial muscles
Pneumatic artificial muscles also known as air muscles  are special tubes that expand  typically up to      when air is forced inside them  They are used in some robot applications                                     

Wire muscles edit 
Main article  Shape memory alloy
Muscle wire  also known as shape memory alloy  is a material that contracts  under     when electricity is applied  They have been used for some small robot applications                         

Electroactive polymers edit 
Main article  Electroactive polymers
EAPs or EPAMs are a plastic material that can contract substantially  up to      activation strain  from electricity  and have been used in facial muscles and arms of humanoid robots              and to enable new robots to float              fly  swim or walk             

Piezo motors edit 
Main article  Piezoelectric motor
Recent alternatives to DC motors are piezo motors or ultrasonic motors  These work on a fundamentally different principle  whereby tiny piezoceramic elements  vibrating many thousands of times per second  cause linear or rotary motion  There are different mechanisms of operation  one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line              Another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a screw  The advantages of these motors are nanometer resolution  speed  and available force for their size              These motors are already available commercially and being used on some robots                         

Elastic nanotubes edit 
Further information  Carbon nanotube
Elastic nanotubes are a promising artificial muscle technology in early stage experimental development  The absence of defects in carbon nanotubes enables these filaments to deform elastically by several percent  with energy storage levels of perhaps         J cm  for metal nanotubes  Human biceps could be replaced with an        mm diameter wire of this material  Such compact  muscle  might allow future robots to outrun and outjump humans             

Sensing edit 
Main articles  Robotic sensing and Robotic sensors
Sensors allow robots to receive information about a certain measurement of the environment  or internal components  This is essential for robots to perform their tasks  and act upon any changes in the environment to calculate the appropriate response  They are used for various forms of measurements  to give the robots warnings about safety or malfunctions  and to provide real time information about the task it is performing 

Touch edit 
Main article  Tactile sensor
Current robotic and prosthetic hands receive far less tactile information than the human hand  Recent research has developed a tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and touch receptors of human fingertips                          The sensor array is constructed as a rigid core surrounded by conductive fluid contained by an elastomeric skin  Electrodes are mounted on the surface of the rigid core and are connected to an impedance measuring device within the core  When the artificial skin touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed  producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object  The researchers expect that an important function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting the robotic grip on held objects 
Scientists from several European countries and Israel developed a prosthetic hand in       called SmartHand  which functions like a real one  allowing patients to write with it  type on a keyboard  play piano  and perform other fine movements  The prosthesis has sensors which enable the patient to sense real feelings in its fingertips             

Further information  Sensory motor map
Other edit 
Other common forms of sensing in robotics use lidar  radar  and sonar              Lidar measures the distance to a target by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflected light with a sensor  Radar uses radio waves to determine the range  angle  or velocity of objects  Sonar uses sound propagation to navigate  communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water 

Mechanical grippers edit 
One of the most common types of end effectors are  grippers   In its simplest manifestation  it consists of just two fingers that can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects  Fingers can  for example  be made of a chain with a metal wire running through it              Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the Shadow Hand and the Robonaut hand              Hands that are of a mid level complexity include the Delft hand                          Mechanical grippers can come in various types  including friction and encompassing jaws  Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction  Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place  using less friction 

Suction end effectors edit 
Suction end effectors  powered by vacuum generators  are very simple astrictive             devices that can hold very large loads provided the prehension surface is smooth enough to ensure suction 
Pick and place robots for electronic components and for large objects like car windscreens  often use very simple vacuum end effectors 
Suction is a highly used type of end effector in industry  in part because the natural compliance of soft suction end effectors can enable a robot to be more robust in the presence of imperfect robotic perception  As an example  consider the case of a robot vision system that estimates the position of a water bottle but has   centimeter of error  While this may cause a rigid mechanical gripper to puncture the water bottle  the soft suction end effector may just bend slightly and conform to the shape of the water bottle surface 

General purpose effectors edit 
Some advanced robots are beginning to use fully humanoid hands  like the Shadow Hand  MANUS              and the Schunk hand              They have powerful robot dexterity intelligence  RDI   with as many as    degrees of freedom and hundreds of tactile sensors

Further information  Control system and Principles of motion sensing
The mechanical structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks              The control of a robot involves three distinct phases   perception  processing  and action  robotic paradigms               Sensors give information about the environment or the robot itself  e g  the position of its joints or its end effector   This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators  motors   which move the mechanical structure to achieve the required co ordinated motion or force actions 
The processing phase can range in complexity  At a reactive level  it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands  e g  firing motor power electronic gates based directly upon encoder feedback signals to achieve the required torque velocity of the shaft   Sensor fusion and internal models may first be used to estimate parameters of interest  e g  the position of the robot s gripper  from noisy sensor data  An immediate task  such as moving the gripper in a certain direction until an object is detected with a proximity sensor  is sometimes inferred from these estimates  Techniques from control theory are generally used to convert the higher level tasks into individual commands that drive the actuators  most often using kinematic and dynamic models of the mechanical structure                                     
At longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks  the robot may need to build and reason with a  cognitive  model  Cognitive models try to represent the robot  the world  and how the two interact  Pattern recognition and computer vision can be used to track objects              Mapping techniques can be used to build maps of the world  Finally  motion planning and other artificial intelligence techniques may be used to figure out how to act  For example  a planner may figure out how to achieve a task without hitting obstacles  falling over  etc 
Modern commercial robotic control systems are highly complex  integrate multiple sensors and effectors  have many interacting degrees of freedom  DOF  and require operator interfaces  programming tools and real time capabilities              They are oftentimes interconnected to wider communication networks and in many cases are now both IoT enabled and mobile              Progress towards open architecture  layered  user friendly and  intelligent  sensor based interconnected robots has emerged from earlier concepts related to Flexible Manufacturing Systems  FMS   and several  open or  hybrid  reference architectures exist which assist developers of robot control software and hardware to move beyond traditional  earlier notions of  closed  robot control systems have been proposed              Open architecture controllers are said to be better able to meet the growing requirements of a wide range of robot users  including system developers  end users and research scientists  and are better positioned to deliver the advanced robotic concepts related to Industry                  In addition to utilizing many established features of robot controllers  such as position  velocity and force control of end effectors  they also enable IoT interconnection and the implementation of more advanced sensor fusion and control techniques  including adaptive control  Fuzzy control and Artificial Neural Network  ANN  based control              When implemented in real time  such techniques can potentially improve the stability and performance of robots operating in unknown or uncertain environments by enabling the control systems to learn and adapt to environmental changes              There are several examples of reference architectures for robot controllers  and also examples of successful implementations of actual robot controllers developed from them  One example of a generic reference architecture and associated interconnected  open architecture robot and controller implementation was used in a number of research and development studies  including prototype implementation of novel advanced and intelligent control and environment mapping methods in real time

Further information  Mobile manipulator
A definition of robotic manipulation has been provided by Matt Mason as   manipulation refers to an agent s control of its environment through selective contact              
Robots need to manipulate objects  pick up  modify  destroy  move or otherwise have an effect  Thus the functional end of a robot arm intended to make the effect  whether a hand  or tool  are often referred to as end effectors              while the  arm  is referred to as a manipulator              Most robot arms have replaceable end effectors  each allowing them to perform some small range of tasks  Some have a fixed manipulator that cannot be replaced  while a few have one very general purpose manipulator  for example  a humanoid hand             

Locomotion edit 
Main articles  Robot locomotion and Mobile robot
Rolling robots edit 
Segway in the Robot museum in Nagoya
For simplicity  most mobile robots have four wheels or a number of continuous tracks  Some researchers have tried to create more complex wheeled robots with only one or two wheels  These can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts  as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four wheeled robot would not be able to 

Two wheeled balancing robots edit 
Balancing robots generally use a gyroscope to detect how much a robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction  to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second  based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum              Many different balancing robots have been designed              While the Segway is not commonly thought of as a robot  it can be thought of as a component of a robot  when used as such Segway refer to them as RMP  Robotic Mobility Platform   An example of this use has been as NASA s Robonaut that has been mounted on a Segway             

One wheeled balancing robots edit 
Main article  Self balancing unicycle
A one wheeled balancing robot is an extension of a two wheeled balancing robot so that it can move in any  D direction using a round ball as its only wheel  Several one wheeled balancing robots have been designed recently  such as Carnegie Mellon University s  Ballbot  which is the approximate height and width of a person  and Tohoku Gakuin University s  BallIP               Because of the long  thin shape and ability to maneuver in tight spaces  they have the potential to function better than other robots in environments with people             

Spherical orb robots edit 
Main article  Spherical robot
Several attempts have been made in robots that are completely inside a spherical ball  either by spinning a weight inside the ball                          or by rotating the outer shells of the sphere                          These have also been referred to as an orb bot             or a ball bot                         

Six wheeled robots edit 
Using six wheels instead of four wheels can give better traction or grip in outdoor terrain such as on rocky dirt or grass 

Tracked robots edit 
Tracks provide even more traction than a six wheeled robot  Tracked wheels behave as if they were made of hundreds of wheels  therefore are very common for outdoor off road robots  where the robot must drive on very rough terrain  However  they are difficult to use indoors such as on carpets and smooth floors  Examples include NASA s Urban Robot  Urbie              

Walking robots edit 
Further information  Mantis the spider robot
Walking is a difficult and dynamic problem to solve  Several robots have been made which can walk reliably on two legs  however  none have yet been made which are as robust as a human  There has been much study on human inspired walking  such as AMBER lab which was established in      by the Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A amp M University              Many other robots have been built that walk on more than two legs  due to these robots being significantly easier to construct                          Walking robots can be used for uneven terrains  which would provide better mobility and energy efficiency than other locomotion methods  Typically  robots on two legs can walk well on flat floors and can occasionally walk up stairs  None can walk over rocky  uneven terrain  Some of the methods which have been tried are 

ZMP technique edit 
Main article  Zero moment point
The zero moment point  ZMP  is the algorithm used by robots such as Honda s ASIMO  The robot s onboard computer tries to keep the total inertial forces  the combination of Earth s gravity and the acceleration and deceleration of walking   exactly opposed by the floor reaction force  the force of the floor pushing back on the robot s foot   In this way  the two forces cancel out  leaving no moment  force causing the robot to rotate and fall over               However  this is not exactly how a human walks  and the difference is obvious to human observers  some of whom have pointed out that ASIMO walks as if it needs the lavatory                                      ASIMO s walking algorithm is not static  and some dynamic balancing is used  see below   However  it still requires a smooth surface to walk on 

Hopping edit 
Several robots  built in the     s by Marc Raibert at the MIT Leg Laboratory  successfully demonstrated very dynamic walking  Initially  a robot with only one leg  and a very small foot could stay upright simply by hopping  The movement is the same as that of a person on a pogo stick  As the robot falls to one side  it would jump slightly in that direction  in order to catch itself              Soon  the algorithm was generalised to two and four legs  A bipedal robot was demonstrated running and even performing somersaults              A quadruped was also demonstrated which could trot  run  pace  and bound              For a full list of these robots  see the MIT Leg Lab Robots page             

Dynamic balancing  controlled falling  edit 
A more advanced way for a robot to walk is by using a dynamic balancing algorithm  which is potentially more robust than the Zero Moment Point technique  as it constantly monitors the robot s motion  and places the feet in order to maintain stability              This technique was recently demonstrated by Anybots  Dexter Robot              which is so stable  it can even jump              Another example is the TU Delft Flame 

Passive dynamics edit 
Main article  Passive dynamics
Perhaps the most promising approach uses passive dynamics where the momentum of swinging limbs is used for greater efficiency  It has been shown that totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope  using only gravity to propel themselves  Using this technique  a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more to walk up a hill  This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers  like ASIMO                         


Flying edit 
A modern passenger airliner is essentially a flying robot  with two humans to manage it  The autopilot can control the plane for each stage of the journey  including takeoff  normal flight  and even landing              Other flying robots are uninhabited and are known as unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs   They can be smaller and lighter without a human pilot on board  and fly into dangerous territory for military surveillance missions  Some can even fire on targets under command  UAVs are also being developed which can fire on targets automatically  without the need for a command from a human  Other flying robots include cruise missiles  the Entomopter  and the Epson micro helicopter robot  Robots such as the Air Penguin  Air Ray  and Air Jelly have lighter than air bodies  are propelled by paddles  and are guided by sonar 

Biomimetic flying robots  BFRs  edit 
A flapping wing BFR generating lift and thrust 
BFRs take inspiration from flying mammals  birds  or insects  BFRs can have flapping wings  which generate the lift and thrust  or they can be propeller actuated  BFRs with flapping wings have increased stroke efficiencies  increased maneuverability  and reduced energy consumption in comparison to propeller actuated BFRs              Mammal and bird inspired BFRs share similar flight characteristics and design considerations  For instance  both mammal and bird inspired BFRs minimize edge fluttering and pressure induced wingtip curl by increasing the rigidity of the wing edge and wingtips  Mammal and insect inspired BFRs can be impact resistant  making them useful in cluttered environments 
Mammal inspired BFRs typically take inspiration from bats  but the flying squirrel has also inspired a prototype              Examples of bat inspired BFRs include Bat Bot             and the DALER              Mammal inspired BFRs can be designed to be multi modal  therefore  they re capable of both flight and terrestrial movement  To reduce the impact of landing  shock absorbers can be implemented along the wings              Alternatively  the BFR can pitch up and increase the amount of drag it experiences              By increasing the drag force  the BFR will decelerate and minimize the impact upon grounding  Different land gait patterns can also be implemented             

Dragonfly inspired BFR 
Bird inspired BFRs can take inspiration from raptors  gulls  and everything in between  Bird inspired BFRs can be feathered to increase the angle of attack range over which the prototype can operate before stalling              The wings of bird inspired BFRs allow for in plane deformation  and the in plane wing deformation can be adjusted to maximize flight efficiency depending on the flight gait              An example of a raptor inspired BFR is the prototype by Savastano et al              The prototype has fully deformable flapping wings and is capable of carrying a payload of up to          kg while performing a parabolic climb  steep descent  and rapid recovery  The gull inspired prototype by Grant et al  accurately mimics the elbow and wrist rotation of gulls  and they find that lift generation is maximized when the elbow and wrist deformations are opposite but equal             
Insect inspired BFRs typically take inspiration from beetles or dragonflies  An example of a beetle inspired BFR is the prototype by Phan and Park              and a dragonfly inspired BFR is the prototype by Hu et al              The flapping frequency of insect inspired BFRs are much higher than those of other BFRs  this is because of the aerodynamics of insect flight              Insect inspired BFRs are much smaller than those inspired by mammals or birds  so they are more suitable for dense environments 

Biologically inspired flying robots edit 
Visualization of entomopter flying on Mars  NASA 
A class of robots that are biologically inspired  but which do not attempt to mimic biology  are creations such as the Entomopter  Funded by DARPA  NASA  the United States Air Force  and the Georgia Tech Research Institute and patented by Prof  Robert C  Michelson for covert terrestrial missions as well as flight in the lower Mars atmosphere  the Entomopter flight propulsion system uses low Reynolds number wings similar to those of the hawk moth  Manduca sexta   but flaps them in a non traditional  opposed x wing fashion  while  blowing  the surface to enhance lift based on the Coand  effect as well as to control vehicle attitude and direction  Waste gas from the propulsion system not only facilitates the blown wing aerodynamics  but also serves to create ultrasonic emissions like that of a Bat for obstacle avoidance  The Entomopter and other biologically inspired robots leverage features of biological systems  but do not attempt to create mechanical analogs 

Snaking edit 
Two robot snakes  The left one has    motors  with   degrees of freedom per segment   the right one    
Several snake robots have been successfully developed  Mimicking the way real snakes move  these robots can navigate very confined spaces  meaning they may one day be used to search for people trapped in collapsed buildings               The Japanese ACM R  snake robot              can even navigate both on land and in water              

Skating edit 
A small number of skating robots have been developed  one of which is a multi mode walking and skating device  It has four legs  with unpowered wheels  which can either step or roll               Another robot  Plen  can use a miniature skateboard or roller skates  and skate across a desktop

Several different approaches have been used to develop robots that have the ability to climb vertical surfaces  One approach mimics the movements of a human climber on a wall with protrusions  adjusting the center of mass and moving each limb in turn to gain leverage  An example of this is Capuchin               built by Ruixiang Zhang at Stanford University  California  Another approach uses the specialized toe pad method of wall climbing geckoes  which can run on smooth surfaces such as vertical glass  Examples of this approach include Wallbot              and Stickybot              
China s Technology Daily reported on    November       that Li Hiu Yeung and his research group of New Concept Aircraft  Zhuhai  Co   Ltd  had successfully developed a bionic gecko robot named  Speedy Freelander   According to Yeung  the gecko robot could rapidly climb up and down a variety of building walls  navigate through ground and wall fissures  and walk upside down on the ceiling  It was also able to adapt to the surfaces of smooth glass  rough  sticky or dusty walls as well as various types of metallic materials  It could also identify and circumvent obstacles automatically  Its flexibility and speed were comparable to a natural gecko  A third approach is to mimic the motion of a snake climbing a pole             

Swimming  Piscine  edit 
It is calculated that when swimming some fish can achieve a propulsive efficiency greater than                   Furthermore  they can accelerate and maneuver far better than any man made boat or submarine  and produce less noise and water disturbance  Therefore  many researchers studying underwater robots would like to copy this type of locomotion               Notable examples are the Robotic Fish G                and Robot Tuna built to analyze and mathematically model thunniform motion               The Aqua Penguin               copies the streamlined shape and propulsion by front  flippers  of penguins  The Aqua Ray and Aqua Jelly emulate the locomotion of manta ray  and jellyfish  respectively 


Robotic Fish  iSplash II
In       iSplash II was developed as the first robotic fish capable of outperforming real carangiform fish in terms of average maximum velocity  measured in body lengths  second  and endurance  the duration that top speed is maintained               This build attained swimming speeds of     BL s  i e           m s                The first build  iSplash I        was the first robotic platform to apply a full body length carangiform swimming motion which was found to increase swimming speed by     over the traditional approach of a posterior confined waveform              

Sailing edit 
The autonomous sailboat robot Vaimos
Sailboat robots have also been developed in order to make measurements at the surface of the ocean  A typical sailboat robot is Vaimos               Since the propulsion of sailboat robots uses the wind  the energy of the batteries is only used for the computer  for the communication and for the actuators  to tune the rudder and the sail   If the robot is equipped with solar panels  the robot could theoretically navigate forever  The two main competitions of sailboat robots are WRSC  which takes place every year in Europe  and Sailbot 

Computational robotics areas edit

Control systems may also have varying levels of autonomy 

Direct interaction is used for haptic or teleoperated devices  and the human has nearly complete control over the robot s motion 
Operator assist modes have the operator commanding medium to high level tasks  with the robot automatically figuring out how to achieve them              
An autonomous robot may go without human interaction for extended periods of time   Higher levels of autonomy do not necessarily require more complex cognitive capabilities  For example  robots in assembly plants are completely autonomous but operate in a fixed pattern 
Another classification takes into account the interaction between human control and the machine motions 

Teleoperation  A human controls each movement  each machine actuator change is specified by the operator 
Supervisory  A human specifies general moves or position changes and the machine decides specific movements of its actuators 
Task level autonomy  The operator specifies only the task and the robot manages itself to complete it 
Full autonomy  The machine will create and complete all its tasks without human interaction 
Vision edit 
Main article  Computer vision
Computer vision is the science and technology of machines that see  As a scientific discipline  computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images  The image data can take many forms  such as video sequences and views from cameras 
In most practical computer vision applications  the computers are pre programmed to solve a particular task  but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common 
Computer vision systems rely on image sensors that detect electromagnetic radiation which is typically in the form of either visible light or infra red light  The sensors are designed using solid state physics  The process by which light propagates and reflects off surfaces is explained using optics  Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process  Robots can also be equipped with multiple vision sensors to be better able to compute the sense of depth in the environment  Like human eyes  robots   eyes  must also be able to focus on a particular area of interest  and also adjust to variations in light intensities 
There is a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological system  at different levels of complexity  Also  some of the learning based methods developed within computer vision have a background in biology

Though a significant percentage of robots in commission today are either human controlled or operate in a static environment  there is an increasing interest in robots that can operate autonomously in a dynamic environment  These robots require some combination of navigation hardware and software in order to traverse their environment  In particular  unforeseen events  e g  people and other obstacles that are not stationary  can cause problems or collisions  Some highly advanced robots such as ASIMO and Mein  robot have particularly good robot navigation hardware and software  Also  self controlled cars  Ernst Dickmanns  driverless car  and the entries in the DARPA Grand Challenge  are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information  including by a swarm of autonomous robots               Most of these robots employ a GPS navigation device with waypoints  along with radar  sometimes combined with other sensory data such as lidar  video cameras  and inertial guidance systems for better navigation between waypoints 

Human robot interaction edit 
Main article  Human robot interaction
Kismet can produce a range of facial expressions 
The state of the art in sensory intelligence for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum cleaning the floors  If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non industrial environments  the way they are instructed to perform their jobs  and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance  The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics  and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive  Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech  gestures  and facial expressions  rather than a command line interface  Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate  it is unnatural for the robot  It will probably be a long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictional C  PO  or Data of Star Trek  Next Generation  Even though the current state of robotics cannot meet the standards of these robots from science fiction  robotic media characters  e g   Wall E  R  D   can elicit audience sympathies that increase people s willingness to accept actual robots in the future               Acceptance of social robots is also likely to increase if people can meet a social robot under appropriate conditions  Studies have shown that interacting with a robot by looking at  touching  or even imagining interacting with the robot can reduce negative feelings that some people have about robots before interacting with them               However  if pre existing negative sentiments are especially strong  interacting with a robot can increase those negative feelings towards robots              

Speech recognition edit 
Main article  Speech recognition
Interpreting the continuous flow of sounds coming from a human  in real time  is a difficult task for a computer  mostly because of the great variability of speech               The same word  spoken by the same person may sound different depending on local acoustics  volume  the previous word  whether or not the speaker has a cold  etc   It becomes even harder when the speaker has a different accent               Nevertheless  great strides have been made in the field since Davis  Biddulph  and Balashek designed the first  voice input system  which recognized  ten digits spoken by a single user with      accuracy  in                    Currently  the best systems can recognize continuous  natural speech  up to     words per minute  with an accuracy of                   With the help of artificial intelligence  machines nowadays can use people s voice to identify their emotions such as satisfied or angry              

Robotic voice edit 
Other hurdles exist when allowing the robot to use voice for interacting with humans  For social reasons  synthetic voice proves suboptimal as a communication medium               making it necessary to develop the emotional component of robotic voice through various techniques                            An advantage of diphonic branching is the emotion that the robot is programmed to project  can be carried on the voice tape  or phoneme  already pre programmed onto the voice media  One of the earliest examples is a teaching robot named Leachim developed in      by Michael J  Freeman                            Leachim was able to convert digital memory to rudimentary verbal speech on pre recorded computer discs               It was programmed to teach students in The Bronx  New York              

Facial expression edit 
Further information  Emotion recognition
Facial expressions can provide rapid feedback on the progress of a dialog between two humans  and soon may be able to do the same for humans and robots  Robotic faces have been constructed by Hanson Robotics using their elastic polymer called Frubber  allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors  servos                The coating and servos are built on a metal skull  A robot should know how to approach a human  judging by their facial expression and body language  Whether the person is happy  frightened  or crazy looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot  Likewise  robots like Kismet and the more recent addition  Nexi              can produce a range of facial expressions  allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans              

Gestures edit 
Further information  Gesture recognition
One can imagine  in the future  explaining to a robot chef how to make a pastry  or asking directions from a robot police officer  In both of these cases  making hand gestures would aid the verbal descriptions  In the first case  the robot would be recognizing gestures made by the human  and perhaps repeating them for confirmation  In the second case  the robot police officer would gesture to indicate  down the road  then turn right   It is likely that gestures will make up a part of the interaction between humans and robots               A great many systems have been developed to recognize human hand gestures              

Proxemics edit 
Proxemics is the study of personal space  and HRI systems may try to model and work with its concepts for human interactions 

Artificial emotions edit 
Artificial emotions can also be generated  composed of a sequence of facial expressions or gestures  As can be seen from the movie Final Fantasy  The Spirits Within  the programming of these artificial emotions is complex and requires a large amount of human observation  To simplify this programming in the movie  presets were created together with a special software program  This decreased the amount of time needed to make the film  These presets could possibly be transferred for use in real life robots  An example of a robot with artificial emotions is Robin the Robot developed by an Armenian IT company Expper Technologies  which uses AI based peer to peer interaction  Its main task is achieving emotional well being  i e  overcome stress and anxiety  Robin was trained to analyze facial expressions and use his face to display his emotions given the context  The robot has been tested by kids in US clinics  and observations show that Robin increased the appetite and cheerfulness of children after meeting and talking              

Personality edit 
Many of the robots of science fiction have a personality  something which may or may not be desirable in the commercial robots of the future               Nevertheless  researchers are trying to create robots which appear to have a personality                            i e  they use sounds  facial expressions  and body language to try to convey an internal state  which may be joy  sadness  or fear  One commercial example is Pleo  a toy robot dinosaur  which can exhibit several apparent emotions              

Research robotics edit 
Further information  Areas of robotics
Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks  but on investigations into new types of robots  alternative ways to think about or design robots  and new ways to manufacture them  Other investigations  such as MIT s cyberflora project  are almost wholly academic 
To describe the level of advancement of a robot  the term  Generation Robots  can be used  This term is coined by Professor Hans Moravec  Principal Research Scientist at the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute in describing the near future evolution of robot technology  First generation robots  Moravec predicted in       should have an intellectual capacity comparable to perhaps a lizard and should become available by       Because the first generation robot would be incapable of learning  however  Moravec predicts that the second generation robot would be an improvement over the first and become available by       with the intelligence maybe comparable to that of a mouse  The third generation robot should have intelligence comparable to that of a monkey  Though fourth generation robots  robots with human intelligence  professor Moravec predicts  would become possible  he does not predict this happening before around      or                   

Dynamics and kinematics edit

External videos How the BB   Sphero Toy Works
The study of motion can be divided into kinematics and dynamics               Direct kinematics or forward kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position  orientation  velocity  and acceleration when the corresponding joint values are known  Inverse kinematics refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values  as done in path planning  Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy  different possibilities of performing the same movement   collision avoidance  and singularity avoidance  Once all relevant positions  velocities  and accelerations have been calculated using kinematics  methods from the field of dynamics are used to study the effect of forces upon these movements  Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known  Direct dynamics is used in computer simulations of the robot  Inverse dynamics refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end effector acceleration  This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot 
In each area mentioned above  researchers strive to develop new concepts and strategies  improve existing ones  and improve the interaction between these areas  To do this  criteria for  optimal  performance and ways to optimize design  structure  and control of robots must be developed and implemented 

Open source robotics edit 
Further information  Open source robotics  List of open source robotics hardware  and List of open source robotics software
Open source robotics research seeks standards for defining  and methods for designing and building  robots so that they can easily be reproduced by anyone  Research includes legal and technical definitions  seeking out alternative tools and materials to reduce costs and simplify builds  and creating interfaces and standards for designs to work together  Human usability research also investigates how to best document builds through visual  text or video instructions 

Evolutionary robotics edit 
Evolutionary robots is a methodology that uses evolutionary computation to help design robots  especially the body form  or motion and behavior controllers  In a similar way to natural evolution  a large population of robots is allowed to compete in some way  or their ability to perform a task is measured using a fitness function  Those that perform worst are removed from the population and replaced by a new set  which have new behaviors based on those of the winners  Over time the population improves  and eventually a satisfactory robot may appear  This happens without any direct programming of the robots by the researchers  Researchers use this method both to create better robots               and to explore the nature of evolution               Because the process often requires many generations of robots to be simulated               this technique may be run entirely or mostly in simulation  using a robot simulator software package  then tested on real robots once the evolved algorithms are good enough               Currently  there are about    million industrial robots toiling around the world  and Japan is the top country having high density of utilizing robots in its manufacturing industry      citation needed     

Bionics and biomimetics edit 
Bionics and biomimetics apply the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals to the design of robots  For example  the design of BionicKangaroo was based on the way kangaroos jump 

Swarm robotics edit 
Swarm robotics is an approach to the coordination of multiple robots as a system which consist of large numbers of mostly simple physical robots   In a robot swarm  the collective behavior of the robots results from local interactions between the robots and between the robots and the environment in which they act

Employment edit

Main article  Technological unemployment
Robotics is an essential component in many modern manufacturing environments  As factories increase their use of robots  the number of robotics related jobs grow and have been observed to be steadily rising               The employment of robots in industries has increased productivity and efficiency savings and is typically seen as a long term investment for benefactors  A study found that    percent of US jobs are at risk to automation  over some unspecified number of years                These claims have been criticized on the ground that social policy  not AI  causes unemployment               In a      article in The Guardian  Stephen Hawking stated  The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing  and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes  with only the most caring  creative or supervisory roles remaining                  The rise of robotics is thus often used as an argument for universal basic income 
According to a GlobalData September      report  the robotics industry was worth    bn in       and by       it will have grown at a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of     to     bn  driving jobs in robotics and related industries              

Occupational safety and health implications edit 
Main article  Workplace robotics safety
A discussion paper drawn up by EU OSHA highlights how the spread of robotics presents both opportunities and challenges for occupational safety and health  OSH               
The greatest OSH benefits stemming from the wider use of robotics should be substitution for people working in unhealthy or dangerous environments  In space  defense  security  or the nuclear industry  but also in logistics  maintenance  and inspection  autonomous robots are particularly useful in replacing human workers performing dirty  dull or unsafe tasks  thus avoiding workers  exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical  ergonomic and psychosocial risks  For example  robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks  to handle radioactive material or to work in explosive atmospheres  In the future  many other highly repetitive  risky or unpleasant tasks will be performed by robots in a variety of sectors like agriculture  construction  transport  healthcare  firefighting or cleaning services              
Moreover  there are certain skills to which humans will be better suited than machines for some time to come and the question is how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills  The advantages of robotics include heavy duty jobs with precision and repeatability  whereas the advantages of humans include creativity  decision making  flexibility  and adaptability  This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in collaborative robots and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the  man robot merger   Some European countries are including robotics in their national programs and trying to promote a safe and flexible cooperation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity  For example  the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  BAuA  organises annual workshops on the topic  human robot collaboration  
In the future  cooperation between robots and humans will be diversified  with robots increasing their autonomy and human robot collaboration reaching completely new forms  Current approaches and technical standards                           aiming to protect employees from the risk of working with collaborative robots will have to be revised 

User experience edit 
Great user experience predicts the needs  experiences  behaviors  language and cognitive abilities  and other factors of each user group  It then uses these insights to produce a product or solution that is ultimately useful and usable  For robots  user experience begins with an understanding of the robot s intended task and environment  while considering any possible social impact the robot may have on human operations and interactions with it              
It defines that communication as the transmission of information through signals  which are elements perceived through touch  sound  smell and sight               The author states that the signal connects the sender to the receiver and consists of three parts  the signal itself  what it refers to  and the interpreter  Body postures and gestures  facial expressions  hand and head movements are all part of nonverbal behavior and communication  Robots are no exception when it comes to human robot interaction  Therefore  humans use their verbal and nonverbal behaviors to communicate their defining characteristics  Similarly  social robots need this coordination to perform human like behaviors 

Careers edit 
Robotics is an interdisciplinary field  combining primarily mechanical engineering and computer science but also drawing on electronic engineering and other subjects  The usual way to build a career in robotics is to complete an undergraduate degree in one of these established subjects  followed by a graduate  masters   degree in Robotics  Graduate degrees are typically joined by students coming from all of the contributing disciplines  and include familiarization of relevant undergraduate level subject matter from each of them  followed by specialist study in pure robotics topics which build upon them  As an interdisciplinary subject  robotics graduate programmes tend to be especially reliant on students working and learning together and sharing their knowledge and skills from their home discipline first degrees 
Robotics industry careers then follow the same pattern  with most roboticists working as part of interdisciplinary teams of specialists from these home disciplines followed by the robotics graduate degrees which enable them to work together  Workers typically continue to identify as members of their home disciplines who work in robotics  rather than as  roboticists   This structure is reinforced by the nature of some engineering professions  which grant chartered engineer status to members of home disciplines rather than to robotics as a whole 
Robotics careers are widely predicted to grow in the   st century  as robots replace more manual and intellectual human work  Some workers who lose their jobs to robotics may be well placed to retrain to build and maintain these robots  using their domain specific knowledge and skills
