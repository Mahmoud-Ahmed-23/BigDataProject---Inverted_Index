            Biological intelligence vs  intelligence in general 
Russell  amp  Norvig             who make the analogy with aeronautical engineering 
McCorduck                 who writes that there are  two major branches of artificial intelligence  one aimed at producing intelligent behavior regardless of how it was accomplioshed  and the other aimed at modeling intelligent processes found in nature  particularly human ones  
Kolata       a paper in Science  which describes McCathy s indifference to biological models  Kolata quotes McCarthy as writing   This is AI  so we don t care if it s psychologically real                        McCarthy recently reiterated his position at the AI       AI     conference where he said  Artificial intelligence is not  by definition  simulation of human intelligence   Maker

   Electronic brain  was the term used by the press around this time                         

  Daniel Crevier wrote   the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science               Russell and Norvig called the conference  the inception of artificial intelligence              

  Russell and Norvig wrote  for the next    years the field would be dominated by these people and their students              

  
Russell and Norvig wrote  it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish              

  
The programs described are Arthur Samuel s checkers program for the IBM      Daniel Bobrow s STUDENT  Newell and Simon s Logic Theorist and Terry Winograd s SHRDLU 

  
Embodied approaches to AI             were championed by Hans Moravec             and Rodney Brooks             and went by many names  Nouvelle AI              Developmental robotics             

  Matteo Wong wrote in The Atlantic   Whereas for decades  computer science fields such as natural language processing  computer vision  and robotics used extremely different methods  now they all use a programming method called  deep learning   As a result  their code and approaches have become more similar  and their models are easier to integrate into one another              

  Jack Clark wrote in Bloomberg   After a half decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence       has been a landmark year  Computers are smarter and learning faster than ever   and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at Google increased from a  sporadic usage  in      to more than       projects in
