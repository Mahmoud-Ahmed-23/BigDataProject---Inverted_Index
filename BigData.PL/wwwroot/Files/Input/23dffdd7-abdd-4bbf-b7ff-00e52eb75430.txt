The Susquehanna Steam Electric Station is a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania  Susquehanna is capable of generating enough power to provide more than two million homes with safe  carbon free  reliable electricity  Susquehanna also supplies its carbon free       energy to an adjacent data center campus  It is located near the Susquehanna River in Salem Township  Luzerne County  Pennsylvania   


Operations edit 
Susquehanna Station Nuclear  a division of Talen Energy  serves as     owner and operator of the     gigawatt Susquehanna Steam Electric Station  PPL operated the plant until June      when Talen Energy was formed from PPL s competitive supply business  The plant has two General Electric boiling water reactors within a Mark II containment building            on a site of       acres           ha   with approximately          employees working on site and additional support employees in Allentown  Pennsylvania  Harrisburg based Allegheny Electric Cooperative purchased     of the plant in                            
The station has been in operation since       The prime builder was Bechtel Power Corporation of Reston  Virginia  In November       the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  extended the operation licenses of the reactors for an additional         years            and the station has received additional license extensions since then with Unit   licensed through      and Unit   through      

Data center edit 
Cumulus Data  a subsidiary of Talen Energy  developed a data center campus directly connected to the Susquehanna plant  On January           it completed the phase   construction             On March          it was sold to Amazon Web Services for     million dollars                         As part of the transaction  the Susquehanna station will provide power to the data center campus

Abandoned plans for an adjacent power plant edit 
In       PPL filed an application with the U S  Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a license to build and operate a new nuclear plant under consideration near Berwick  Pennsylvania  The Bell Bend Nuclear Power Plant would be built near the company s existing two unit Susquehanna nuclear power plant  On August           Talen Energy formally requested the license application be withdrawn              and the NRC officially accepted the application withdrawal on September                       officially cancelling the project  Unlike the existing two units  which are American designed boiling water reactors  the plan called for the French German EPR which is a pressurized water reactor  At     Gigawatt net electric nameplate capacity       GW in the case of Taishan nuclear power plant   the EPR is the nuclear power plant  design with the highest per reactor electric power output ever built 

Incidents edit 
In the plant s first emergency  an electrical fire erupted at a switch box that controls the supply of cooling water to emergency systems  No injuries were reported following the      incident             
Roughly        gallons of mildly radioactive water spilled at the Station s Unit   turbine building after a gasket failed in the filtering system in       No radiation was released from the building to the public  and no personnel were contaminated as a result of this incident             

Surrounding population edit 
One of the power plant s cooling towers from the north
The NRC defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants  a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of    miles          km   concerned primarily with exposure to  and inhalation of  airborne radioactive contamination  and an ingestion pathway zone of about    miles          km   concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity             
The      U S  population within    miles          km  of Susquehanna was         an increase of     percent in a decade  according to an analysis of U S  Census data for msnbc com  The      U S  population within    miles          km  was            an increase of     percent since       Cities within    miles include Wilkes Barre     miles to city center  and the larger city  Scranton     miles to center city              

Seismic risk edit 
The NRC s estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Susquehanna was   in         according to an NRC study published in August
