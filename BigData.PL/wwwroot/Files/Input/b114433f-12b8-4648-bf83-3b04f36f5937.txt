Form of shared internet based computing
 Cloud Computing  redirects here and is not to be confused with Cloud Computing  horse  



Cloud computing metaphor  the group of networked elements providing services does not need to be addressed or managed individually by users  instead  the entire provider managed suite of hardware and software can be thought of as an amorphous cloud 
Cloud computing is  a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with self service provisioning and administration on demand   according to ISO            


Essential Characteristics
In       the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  identified five  essential characteristics  for cloud systems             Below are the exact definitions according to NIST            

On demand self service   A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities  such as server time and network storage  as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider  
Broad network access   Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms  e g   mobile phones  tablets  laptops  and workstations   
Resource pooling    The provider s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi tenant model  with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand  
Rapid elasticity   Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released  in some cases automatically  to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand  To the consumer  the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time  
Measured service   Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service  e g   storage  processing  bandwidth  and active user accounts   Resource usage can be monitored  controlled  and reported  providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service 
By       the International Organization for Standardization  ISO  had expanded and refined the list            

History
Main article  History of cloud computing
The history of cloud computing extends back to the     s  with the initial concepts of time sharing becoming popularized via remote job entry  RJE   The  data center  model  where users submitted jobs to operators to run on mainframes  was predominantly used during this era  This was a time of exploration and experimentation with ways to make large scale computing power available to more users through time sharing  optimizing the infrastructure  platform  and applications  and increasing efficiency for end users            
The  cloud  metaphor for virtualized services dates to       when it was used by General Magic for the universe of  places  that mobile agents in the Telescript environment could  go   The metaphor is credited to David Hoffman  a General Magic communications specialist  based on its long standing use in networking and telecom             The expression cloud computing became more widely known in      when Compaq Computer Corporation drew up a business plan for future computing and the Internet  The company s ambition was to supercharge sales with  cloud computing enabled applications   The business plan foresaw that online consumer file storage would likely be commercially successful  As a result  Compaq decided to sell server hardware to internet service providers            
In the     s  the application of cloud computing began to take shape with the establishment of Amazon Web Services  AWS  in       which allowed developers to build applications independently  In      Amazon Simple Storage Service  known as Amazon S   and the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  EC   were released  In      NASA s development of the first open source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds                       
The following decade saw the launch of various cloud services  In       Microsoft launched Microsoft Azure  and Rackspace Hosting and NASA initiated an open source cloud software project  OpenStack  IBM introduced the IBM SmartCloud framework in       and Oracle announced the Oracle Cloud in       In December       Amazon launched AWS Outposts  a service that extends AWS infrastructure  services  APIs  and tools to customer data centers  co location spaces  or on premises facilities

Cloud computing can enable shorter time to market by providing pre configured tools  scalable resources  and managed services  allowing users to focus on their core business value instead of maintaining infrastructure  Cloud platforms can enable organizations and individuals to reduce upfront capital expenditures on physical infrastructure by shifting to an operational expenditure model  where costs scale with usage  Cloud platforms also offer managed services and tools  such as artificial intelligence  data analytics  and machine learning  which might otherwise require significant in house expertise and infrastructure investment                                     
While cloud computing can offer cost advantages through effective resource optimization  organizations often face challenges such as unused resources  inefficient configurations  and hidden costs without proper oversight and governance  Many cloud platforms provide cost management tools  such as AWS Cost Explorer and Azure Cost Management  and frameworks like FinOps have emerged to standardize financial operations in the cloud  Cloud computing also facilitates collaboration  remote work  and global service delivery by enabling secure access to data and applications from any location with an internet connection                                     
Cloud providers offer various redundancy options for core services  such as managed storage and managed databases  though redundancy configurations often vary by service tier  Advanced redundancy strategies  such as cross region replication or failover systems  typically require explicit configuration and may incur additional costs or licensing fees                                     
Cloud environments operate under a shared responsibility model  where providers are typically responsible for infrastructure security  physical hardware  and software updates  while customers are accountable for data encryption  identity and access management  IAM   and application level security  These responsibilities vary depending on the cloud service model Infrastructure as a Service  IaaS   Platform as a Service  PaaS   or Software as a Service  SaaS  with customers typically having more control and responsibility in IaaS environments and progressively less in PaaS and SaaS models  often trading control for convenience and managed services                                     

Factors influencing the adoption and suitability of cloud computing
This section cites its sources but does not provide page references  You can help by providing page numbers for existing citations    January        Learn how and when to remove this message 
The decision to adopt cloud computing or maintain on premises infrastructure depends on factors such as scalability  cost structure  latency requirements  regulatory constraints  and infrastructure customization                                                 
Organizations with variable or unpredictable workloads  limited capital for upfront investments  or a focus on rapid scalability benefit from cloud adoption  Startups  SaaS companies  and e commerce platforms often prefer the pay as you go operational expenditure  OpEx  model of cloud infrastructure  Additionally  companies prioritizing global accessibility  remote workforce enablement  disaster recovery  and leveraging advanced services such as AI ML and analytics are well suited for the cloud  In recent years  some cloud providers have started offering specialized services for high performance computing and low latency applications  addressing some use cases previously exclusive to on premises setups                                                 
On the other hand  organizations with strict regulatory requirements  highly predictable workloads  or reliance on deeply integrated legacy systems may find cloud infrastructure less suitable  Businesses in industries like defense  government  or those handling highly sensitive data often favor on premises setups for greater control and data sovereignty  Additionally  companies with ultra low latency requirements  such as high frequency trading  HFT  firms  rely on custom hardware  e g   FPGAs  and physical proximity to exchanges  which most cloud providers cannot fully replicate despite recent advancements  Similarly  tech giants like Google  Meta  and Amazon build their own data centers due to economies of scale  predictable workloads  and the ability to customize hardware and network infrastructure for optimal efficiency  However  these companies also use cloud services selectively for certain workloads and applications where it aligns with their operational needs                                                 
In practice  many organizations are increasingly adopting hybrid cloud architectures  combining on premises infrastructure with cloud services  This approach allows businesses to balance scalability  cost effectiveness  and control  offering the benefits of both deployment models while mitigating their respective limitations                                                 

Challenges and limitations
Main article  Cloud computing issues
One of the main challenges of cloud computing  in comparison to more traditional on premises computing  is data security and privacy  Cloud users entrust their sensitive data to third party providers  who may not have adequate measures to protect it from unauthorized access  breaches  or leaks  Cloud users also face compliance risks if they have to adhere to certain regulations or standards regarding data protection  such as GDPR or HIPAA             
Another challenge of cloud computing is reduced visibility and control  Cloud users may not have full insight into how their cloud resources are managed  configured  or optimized by their providers  They may also have limited ability to customize or modify their cloud services according to their specific needs or preferences              Complete understanding of all technology may be impossible  especially given the scale  complexity  and deliberate opacity of contemporary systems  however  there is a need for understanding complex technologies and their interconnections to have power and agency within them              The metaphor of the cloud can be seen as problematic as cloud computing retains the aura of something noumenal and numinous  it is something experienced without precisely understanding what it is or how it works             
Additionally  cloud migration is a significant challenge  This process involves transferring data  applications  or workloads from one cloud environment to another  or from on premises infrastructure to the cloud  Cloud migration can be complicated  time consuming  and expensive  particularly when there are compatibility issues between different cloud platforms or architectures  If not carefully planned and executed  cloud migration can lead to downtime  reduced performance  or even data loss             

Cloud migration challenges
According to the      State of the Cloud Report by Flexera  approximately     of respondents identified the following top challenges when migrating workloads to public clouds             

 Understanding application dependencies 
 Comparing on premise and cloud costs 
 Assessing technical feasibility  
Implementation challenges
Applications hosted in the cloud are susceptible to the fallacies of distributed computing  a series of misconceptions that can lead to significant issues in software development and deployment             

Cloud cost overruns
In a report by Gartner  a survey of     IT leaders revealed that     experienced budget overruns in their organizations  cloud expenditures during       Conversely      of IT leaders whose organizations stayed within budget attributed their success to accurate forecasting and budgeting  proactive monitoring of spending  and effective optimization             
The      Flexera State of Cloud Report identifies the top cloud challenges as managing cloud spend  followed by security concerns and lack of expertise  Public cloud expenditures exceeded budgeted amounts by an average of      The report also reveals that cost savings is the top cloud initiative for     of respondents  Furthermore      measure cloud progress through cost savings  while     prioritize shorter time to market  indicating that cloud s promise of accelerated deployment is often overshadowed by cost concerns             

Service Level Agreements
Typically  cloud providers  Service Level Agreements  SLAs  do not encompass all forms of service interruptions  Exclusions typically include planned maintenance  downtime resulting from external factors such as network issues  human errors  like misconfigurations  natural disasters  force majeure events  or security breaches  Typically  customers bear the responsibility of monitoring SLA compliance and must file claims for any unmet SLAs within a designated timeframe  Customers should be aware of how deviations from SLAs are calculated  as these parameters may vary by service  These requirements can place a considerable burden on customers  Additionally  SLA percentages and conditions can differ across various services within the same provider  with some services lacking any SLA altogether  In cases of service interruptions due to hardware failures in the cloud provider  the company typically does not offer monetary compensation  Instead  eligible users may receive credits as outlined in the corresponding SLA                                                 

Leaky abstractions
Cloud computing abstractions aim to simplify resource management  but leaky abstractions can expose underlying complexities  These variations in abstraction quality depend on the cloud vendor  service and architecture  Mitigating leaky abstractions requires users to understand the implementation details and limitations of the cloud services they utilize                                     

Service lock in within the same vendor
Service lock in within the same vendor occurs when a customer becomes dependent on specific services within a cloud vendor  making it challenging to switch to alternative services within the same vendor when their needs change                         

Security and privacy
Cloud suppliers security and privacy agreements must be aligned to the demand s  requirements and regulations 
Main article  Cloud computing security
Cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time   It could accidentally or deliberately alter or delete information              Many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order without a warrant  That is permitted in their privacy policies  which users must agree to before they start using cloud services  Solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as end users  choices for how data is stored              Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access              Identity management systems can also provide practical solutions to privacy concerns in cloud computing  These systems distinguish between authorized and unauthorized users and determine the amount of data that is accessible to each entity              The systems work by creating and describing identities  recording activities  and getting rid of unused identities 
According to the Cloud Security Alliance  the top three threats in the cloud are Insecure Interfaces and APIs  Data Loss  amp  Leakage  and Hardware Failure which accounted for          and     of all cloud security outages respectively  Together  these form shared technology vulnerabilities  In a cloud provider platform being shared by different users  there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on the same data server  Additionally  Eugene Schultz  chief technology officer at Emagined Security  said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud   There are some real Achilles  heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into   Because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers  hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack a process he called  hyperjacking   Some examples of this include the Dropbox security breach  and iCloud      leak              Dropbox had been breached in October       having over seven million of its users passwords stolen by hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by Bitcoins  BTC   By having these passwords  they are able to read private data as well as have this data be indexed by search engines  making the information public              
There is the problem of legal ownership of the data  If a user stores some data in the cloud  can the cloud provider profit from it    Many Terms of Service agreements are silent on the question of ownership              Physical control of the computer equipment  private cloud  is more secure than having the equipment off site and under someone else s control  public cloud   This delivers great incentive to public cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure services              Some small businesses that do not have expertise in IT security could find that it is more secure for them to use a public cloud  There is the risk that end users do not understand the issues involved when signing on to a cloud service  persons sometimes do not read the many pages of the terms of service agreement  and just click  Accept  without reading   This is important now that cloud computing is common and required for some services to work  for example for an intelligent personal assistant  Apple s Siri or Google Assistant   Fundamentally  private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the owner  however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money investment from the user             
The attacks that can be made on cloud computing systems include man in the middle attacks  phishing attacks  authentication attacks  and malware attacks  One of the largest threats is considered to be malware attacks  such as Trojan horses  Recent research conducted in      has revealed that the Trojan horse injection method is a serious problem with harmful impacts on cloud computing systems

Comparison of on premise  IaaS  PaaS  and SaaS
Cloud computing service models arranged as layers in a stack
The National Institute of Standards and Technology recognized three cloud service models in       Infrastructure as a Service  IaaS   Platform as a Service  PaaS   and Software as a Service  SaaS              The International Organization for Standardization  ISO  later identified additional models in       including  Network as a Service    Communications as a Service    Compute as a Service   and  Data Storage as a Service             

Infrastructure as a service  IaaS 
Main article  Infrastructure as a service
Infrastructure as a service  IaaS  refers to online services that provide high level APIs used to abstract various low level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources  location  data partitioning  scaling  security  backup  etc  A hypervisor runs the virtual machines as guests  Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers  varying requirements  Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single Linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware  Linux cgroups and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate  secure and manage the containers  The use of containers offers higher performance than virtualization because there is no hypervisor overhead  IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual machine disk image library  raw block storage  file or object storage  firewalls  load balancers  IP addresses  virtual local area networks  VLANs   and software bundles             

Further information  CloudBioLinux
The NIST s definition of cloud computing describes IaaS as  where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software  which can include operating systems and applications  The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems  storage  and deployed applications  and possibly limited control of select networking components  e g   host firewalls              
IaaS cloud providers supply these resources on demand from their large pools of equipment installed in data centers  For wide area connectivity  customers can use either the Internet or carrier clouds  dedicated virtual private networks   To deploy their applications  cloud users install operating system images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure  In this model  the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software  Cloud providers typically bill IaaS services on a utility computing basis  cost reflects the number of resources allocated and consumed             

Platform as a service  PaaS 
Main article  Platform as a service
The NIST s definition of cloud computing defines Platform as a Service as            

The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer created or acquired applications created using programming languages  libraries  services  and tools supported by the provider  The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network  servers  operating systems  or storage  but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application hosting environment 
PaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers  The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment  In the PaaS models  cloud providers deliver a computing platform  typically including an operating system  programming language execution environment  database  and the web server  Application developers develop and run their software on a cloud platform instead of directly buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers  With some PaaS  the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually                  need quotation to verify     
Some integration and data management providers also use specialized applications of PaaS as delivery models for data  Examples include iPaaS  Integration Platform as a Service  and dPaaS  Data Platform as a Service   iPaaS enables customers to develop  execute and govern integration flows              Under the iPaaS integration model  customers drive the development and deployment of integrations without installing or managing any hardware or middleware              dPaaS delivers integration and data management products as a fully managed service              Under the dPaaS model  the PaaS provider  not the customer  manages the development and execution of programs by building data applications for the customer  dPaaS users access data through data visualization tools             

Software as a service  SaaS 
Main article  Software as a service
The NIST s definition of cloud computing defines Software as a Service as            

The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider s applications running on a cloud infrastructure  The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface  such as a web browser  e g   web based email   or a program interface  The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network  servers  operating systems  storage  or even individual application capabilities  with the possible exception of limited user specific application configuration settings 
In the software as a service  SaaS  model  users gain access to application software and databases  Cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications  SaaS is sometimes referred to as  on demand software  and is usually priced on a pay per use basis or using a subscription fee              In the SaaS model  cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients  Cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs  This eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud user s own computers  which simplifies maintenance and support  Cloud applications differ from other applications in their scalability which can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple virtual machines at run time to meet changing work demand              Load balancers distribute the work over the set of virtual machines  This process is transparent to the cloud user  who sees only a single access point  To accommodate a large number of cloud users  cloud applications can be multitenant  meaning that any machine may serve more than one cloud user organization 
The pricing model for SaaS applications is typically a monthly or yearly flat fee per user              so prices become scalable and adjustable if users are added or removed at any point  It may also be free              Proponents claim that SaaS gives a business the potential to reduce IT operational costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the cloud provider  This enables the business to reallocate IT operations costs away from hardware software spending and from personnel expenses  towards meeting other goals  In addition  with applications hosted centrally  updates can be released without the need for users to install new software  One drawback of SaaS comes with storing the users  data on the cloud provider s server  As a result      citation needed      there could be unauthorized access to the data              Examples of applications offered as SaaS are games and productivity software like Google Docs and Office Online  SaaS applications may be integrated with cloud storage or File hosting services  which is the case with Google Docs being integrated with Google Drive  and Office Online being integrated with OneDrive             

Serverless computing
Main article  Serverless computing
Serverless computing allows customers to use various cloud capabilities without the need to provision  deploy  or manage hardware or software resources  apart from providing their application code or data  ISO IEC              classifies serverless alongside Infrastructure as a Service  IaaS   Platform as a Service  PaaS   and Software as a Service  SaaS  under the broader category of cloud service categories  Notably  while ISO refers to these classifications as cloud service categories  the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  refers to them as service models                       

Deployment models
Cloud computing types
 A cloud deployment model represents the way in which cloud computing can be organized based on the control and sharing of physical or virtual resources              Cloud deployment models define the fundamental patterns of interaction between cloud customers and cloud providers  They do not detail implementation specifics or the configuration of resources            

Private
Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization  whether managed internally or by a third party  and hosted either internally or externally             Undertaking a private cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment  and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources  It can improve business  but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities  Self run data centers             are generally capital intensive  They have a significant physical footprint  requiring allocations of space  hardware  and environmental controls  These assets have to be refreshed periodically  resulting in additional capital expenditures  They have attracted criticism because users  still have to buy  build  and manage them  and thus do not benefit from less hands on management              essentially   lacking  the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept                          

Public
For a comparison of cloud computing software and providers  see Cloud computing comparison
Cloud services are considered  public  when they are delivered over the public Internet  and they may be offered as a paid subscription  or free of charge              Architecturally  there are few differences between public  and private cloud services  but security concerns increase substantially when services  applications  storage  and other resources  are shared by multiple customers  Most public cloud providers offer direct connection services that allow customers to securely link their legacy data centers to their cloud resident applications                         
Several factors like the functionality of the solutions  cost  integrational and organizational aspects as well as safety  amp  security are influencing the decision of enterprises and organizations to choose a public cloud or on premises solution             

Hybrid
See also  Hybrid cloud storage
Hybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment  such as a private cloud or on premises resources                          that remain distinct entities but are bound together  offering the benefits of multiple deployment models  Hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation  managed and or dedicated services with cloud resources             Gartner defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private  public and community cloud services  from different service providers              A hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it cannot be simply put in one category of private  public  or community cloud service  It allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service  by aggregation  integration or customization with another cloud service 
Varied use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist  For example  an organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud application  but interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service              This example of hybrid cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service through the addition of externally available public cloud services  Hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of factors such as data security and compliance requirements  level of control needed over data  and the applications an organization uses             
Another example of hybrid cloud is one where IT organizations use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that can not be met by the private cloud              This capability enables hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds             Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or data center and  bursts  to a public cloud when the demand for computing capacity increases  A primary advantage of cloud bursting and a hybrid cloud model is that an organization pays for extra compute resources only when they are needed              Cloud bursting enables data centers to create an in house IT infrastructure that supports average workloads  and use cloud resources from public or private clouds  during spikes in processing demands             

Community
Community cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns  security  compliance  jurisdiction  etc    whether it is managed internally or by a third party  and hosted internally or externally  the costs are distributed among fewer users compared to a public cloud  but more than a private cloud   As a result  only a portion of the potential cost savings of cloud computing is achieved 
           

Multi cloud
Main article  Multicloud
According to ISO IEC           multi cloud is a cloud deployment model in which a customer uses public cloud services provided by two or more cloud service providers                      Poly cloud refers to the use of multiple public clouds for the purpose of leveraging specific services that each provider offers  It differs from Multi cloud in that it is not designed to increase flexibility or mitigate against failures but is rather used to allow an organization to achieve more than could be done with a single provider             

Market
According to International Data Corporation  IDC   global spending on cloud computing services has reached      billion and is expected to reach      trillion by                   Gartner estimated that global public cloud services end user spending would reach      billion by                   According to a McKinsey  amp  Company report  cloud cost optimization levers and value oriented business use cases foresee more than    trillion in run rate EBITDA across Fortune     companies as up for grabs in                   In       more than      trillion in enterprise IT spending was at stake from the shift to the cloud  growing to almost      trillion in       according to Gartner             
The European Commission s      Communication identified several issues which were impeding the development of the cloud computing market                         Section         

fragmentation of the digital single market across the EU
concerns about contracts including reservations about data access and ownership  data portability  and change control
variations in standards applicable to cloud computing
The Communication set out a series of  digital agenda actions  which the Commission proposed to undertake in order to support the development of a fair and effective market for cloud computing services                         Pages            

Cloud Computing Vendors
As of       the three largest cloud computing providers by market share  commonly referred to as hyperscalers  are Amazon Web Services  AWS   Microsoft Azure  and Google Cloud                          These companies dominate the global cloud market due to their extensive infrastructure  broad service offerings  and scalability  
In recent years  organizations have increasingly adopted alternative cloud providers  which offer specialized services that distinguish them from hyperscalers  These providers may offer advantages such as lower costs  improved cost transparency and predictability  enhanced data sovereignty  particularly within regions such as the European Union to comply with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR    stronger alignment with local regulatory requirements  or industry specific services             
Alternative cloud providers are often part of multi cloud strategies  where organizations use multiple cloud services both from hyperscalers and specialized providers to optimize performance  compliance  and cost efficiency  However  they do not necessarily serve as direct replacements for hyperscalers  as their offerings are typically more specialized             

Alternative Cloud Providers
Several alternative cloud providers offer specialized services that differentiate them from hyperscalers

Similar concepts
The goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take benefit from all of these technologies  without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them  The cloud aims to cut costs and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by IT obstacles              The main enabling technology for cloud computing is virtualization  Virtualization software separates a physical computing device into one or more  virtual  devices  each of which can be easily used and managed to perform computing tasks  With operating system level virtualization essentially creating a scalable system of multiple independent computing devices  idle computing resources can be allocated and used more efficiently  Virtualization provides the agility required to speed up IT operations and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure utilization  Autonomic computing automates the process through which the user can provision resources on demand  By minimizing user involvement  automation speeds up the process  reduces labor costs and reduces the possibility of human errors             
Cloud computing uses concepts from utility computing to provide metrics for the services used  Cloud computing attempts to address QoS  quality of service  and reliability problems of other grid computing models
