Graph exploring search algorithm
Best first search is a class of search algorithms which explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule 
Judea Pearl described best first search as estimating the promise of node n by a  heuristic evaluation function 
  
    
      
        f
         
        n
         
      
    
      displaystyle f n  
  
 which  in general  may depend on the description of n  the description of the goal  the information gathered by the search up to that point  and most importantly  on any extra knowledge about the problem domain                        
Some authors have used  best first search  to refer specifically to a search with a heuristic that attempts to predict how close the end of a path is to a solution  or  goal   so that paths which are judged to be closer to a solution  or  goal  are expanded first  This specific type of search is called greedy best first search            or pure heuristic search            
Efficient selection of the current best candidate for extension is typically implemented using a priority queue 
The A  search algorithm is an example of a best first search algorithm  as is B   Best first algorithms are often used for path finding in combinatorial search  Neither A  nor B  is a greedy best first search  as they incorporate the distance from the start in addition to estimated distances to the goal 


Greedy BeFS edit 
Using a greedy algorithm  expand the first successor of the parent  After a successor is generated            

If the successor s heuristic is better than its parent  the successor is set at the front of the queue  with the parent reinserted directly behind it   and the loop restarts 
Else  the successor is inserted into the queue  in a location determined by its heuristic value   The procedure will evaluate the remaining successors  if any  of the parent 
Below is a pseudocode example of this algorithm  where queue represents a priority queue which orders nodes based on their heuristic distances from the goal  This implementation keeps track of visited nodes  and can therefore be used for undirected graphs  It can be modified to retrieve the path 

procedure GBS start  target  is 
  mark start as visited
  add start to queue
  while queue is not empty do 
    current node         vertex of queue with min distance to target
    remove current node from queue
    foreach neighbor n of current node do 
      if n not in visited then 
        if n is target 
          return n
        else 
          mark n as visited
          add n to queue
  return failure
