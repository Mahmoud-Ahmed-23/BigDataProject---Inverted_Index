Privacy  UK    pr v si   US    pra                           is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves  and thereby express themselves selectively 
The domain of privacy partially overlaps with security  which can include the concepts of appropriate use and protection of information  Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity 
Throughout history  there have been various conceptions of privacy  Most cultures acknowledge the right of individuals to keep aspects of their personal lives out of the public domain  The right to be free from unauthorized invasions of privacy by governments  corporations  or individuals is enshrined in the privacy laws of many countries and  in some instances  their constitutions 
With the rise of technology  the debate regarding privacy has expanded from a bodily sense to include a digital sense  In most countries  the right to digital privacy is considered an extension of the original right to privacy  and many countries have passed acts that further protect digital privacy from public and private entities 
There are multiple techniques to invade privacy  which may be employed by corporations or governments for profit or political reasons  Conversely  in order to protect privacy  people may employ encryption or anonymity measures 


Etymology edit 
The word privacy is derived from the Latin word and concept of  privatus   which referred to things set apart from what is public  personal and belonging to oneself  and not to the state             Literally   privatus  is the past participle of the Latin verb  privere  meaning  to be deprived of

Philosophical views on privacy edit 
The concept of privacy has been explored and discussed by numerous philosophers throughout history 
Privacy has historical roots in ancient Greek philosophical discussions  The most well known of these was Aristotle s distinction between two spheres of life  the public sphere of the polis  associated with political life  and the private sphere of the oikos  associated with domestic life             Privacy is valued along with other basic necessities of life in the Jewish deutero canonical Book of Sirach            
Islam s holy text  the Qur an  states the following regarding privacy   Do not spy on one another            Do not enter any houses except your own homes unless you are sure of their occupants  consent                     
English philosopher John Locke s             writings on natural rights and the social contract laid the groundwork for modern conceptions of individual rights  including the right to privacy  In his Second Treatise of Civil Government        Locke argued that a man is entitled to his own self through one s natural rights of life  liberty  and property             He believed that the government was responsible for protecting these rights so individuals were guaranteed private spaces to practice personal activities            
In the political sphere  philosophers hold differing views on the right of private judgment  German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel             makes the distinction between moralit t  which refers to an individual s private judgment  and sittlichkeit  pertaining to one s rights and obligations as defined by an existing corporate order  On the contrary  Jeremy Bentham              an English philosopher  interpreted law as an invasion of privacy  His theory of utilitarianism argued that legal actions should be judged by the extent of their contribution to human wellbeing  or necessary utility             
Hegel s notions were modified by prominent   th century English philosopher John Stuart Mill  Mill s essay On Liberty        argued for the importance of protecting individual liberty against the tyranny of the majority and the interference of the state  His views emphasized the right of privacy as essential for personal development and self expression             
Discussions surrounding surveillance coincided with philosophical ideas on privacy  Jeremy Bentham developed the phenomenon known as the Panoptic effect through his      architectural design of a prison called Panopticon  The phenomenon explored the possibility of surveillance as a general awareness of being watched that could never be proven at any particular moment              French philosopher Michel Foucault             concluded that the possibility of surveillance in the instance of the Panopticon meant a prisoner had no choice but to conform to the prison s rules

As technology has advanced  the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it  In the case of some technologies  such as the printing press or the Internet  the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached  It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the United States was the      article by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis   The Right to Privacy               and that it was written mainly in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies             
In             written by George Orwell  was published  A classic dystopian novel       describes the life of Winston Smith in       located in Oceania  a totalitarian state  The all controlling Party  the party in power led by Big Brother  is able to control power through mass surveillance and limited freedom of speech and thought  George Orwell provides commentary on the negative effects of totalitarianism  particularly on privacy and censorship              Parallels have been drawn between      and modern censorship and privacy  a notable example being that large social media companies  rather than the government  are able to monitor a user s data and decide what is allowed to be said online through their censorship policies  ultimately for monetary purposes             
In the     s  people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy              Vance Packard s The Naked Society was a popular book on privacy from that era and led US discourse on privacy at that time              In addition  Alan Westin s Privacy and Freedom shifted the debate regarding privacy from a physical sense  how the government controls a person s body  i e  Roe v  Wade  and other activities such as wiretapping and photography  As important records became digitized  Westin argued that personal data was becoming too accessible and that a person should have complete jurisdiction over their data  laying the foundation for the modern discussion of privacy             
New technologies can also create new ways to gather private information  In       the legal case Kyllo v  United States      U S      determined that the use of thermal imaging devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant constitutes a violation of privacy  In       after developing a corporate rivalry in competing voice recognition software  Apple and Amazon required employees to listen to intimate moments and faithfully transcribe the contents

Police and citizens often conflict on what degree the police can intrude a citizen s digital privacy  For instance  in       the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in United States v  Jones      U S        in the case of Antoine Jones who was arrested of drug possession using a GPS tracker on his car that was placed without a warrant  that warrantless tracking infringes the Fourth Amendment  The Supreme Court also justified that there is some  reasonable expectation of privacy  in transportation since the reasonable expectation of privacy had already been established under Griswold v  Connecticut         The Supreme Court also further clarified that the Fourth Amendment did not only pertain to physical instances of intrusion but also digital instances  and thus United States v  Jones became a landmark case             
In       the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Riley v  California      U S        where David Leon Riley was arrested after he was pulled over for driving on expired license tags when the police searched his phone and discovered that he was tied to a shooting  that searching a citizen s phone without a warrant was an unreasonable search  a violation of the Fourth Amendment  The Supreme Court concluded that the cell phones contained personal information different from trivial items  and went beyond to state that information stored on the cloud was not necessarily a form of evidence  Riley v  California evidently became a landmark case  protecting the digital protection of citizen s privacy when confronted with the police             
A recent notable occurrence of the conflict between law enforcement and a citizen in terms of digital privacy has been in the      case  Carpenter v  United States      U S         In this case  the FBI used cell phone records without a warrant to arrest Timothy Ivory Carpenter on multiple charges  and the Supreme Court ruled that the warrantless search of cell phone records violated the Fourth Amendment  citing that the Fourth Amendment protects  reasonable expectations of privacy  and that information sent to third parties still falls under data that can be included under  reasonable expectations of privacy              
Beyond law enforcement  many interactions between the government and citizens have been revealed either lawfully or unlawfully  specifically through whistleblowers  One notable example is Edward Snowden  who released multiple operations related to the mass surveillance operations of the National Security Agency  NSA   where it was discovered that the NSA continues to breach the security of millions of people  mainly through mass surveillance programs whether it was collecting great amounts of data through third party private companies  hacking into other embassies or frameworks of international countries  and various breaches of data  which prompted a culture shock and stirred international debate related to digital privacy             

Internet edit

The Internet and technologies built on it enable new forms of social interactions at increasingly faster speeds and larger scales  Because the computer networks which underlie the Internet introduce such a wide range of novel security concerns  the discussion of privacy on the Internet is often conflated with security              Indeed  many entities such as corporations involved in the surveillance economy inculcate a security focused conceptualization of privacy which reduces their obligations to uphold privacy into a matter of regulatory compliance              while at the same time lobbying to minimize those regulatory requirements             
The Internet s effect on privacy includes all of the ways that computational technology and the entities that control it can subvert the privacy expectations of their users                          In particular  the right to be forgotten is motivated by both the computational ability to store and search through massive amounts of data as well as the subverted expectations of users who share information online without expecting it to be stored and retained indefinitely  Phenomena such as revenge porn and deepfakes are not merely individual because they require both the ability to obtain images without someone s consent as well as the social and economic infrastructure to disseminate that content widely              Therefore  privacy advocacy groups such as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative and the Electronic Frontier Foundation argue that addressing the new privacy harms introduced by the Internet requires both technological improvements to encryption and anonymity as well as societal efforts such as legal regulations to restrict corporate and government power                         
While the Internet began as a government and academic effort up through the     s  private corporations began to enclose the hardware and software of the Internet in the     s  and now most Internet infrastructure is owned and managed by for profit corporations              As a result  the ability of governments to protect their citizens  privacy is largely restricted to industrial policy  instituting controls on corporations that handle communications or personal data                          Privacy regulations are often further constrained to only protect specific demographics such as children              or specific industries such as credit card bureaus             

Social networking edit 
Main article  Privacy concerns with social networking services
Several online social network sites  OSNs  are among the top    most visited websites globally  Facebook for example  as of August       was the largest social networking site  with nearly     billion             members  who upload over      billion pieces of content daily  While Twitter is significantly smaller with     million registered users  the US Library of Congress recently announced that it will be acquiring and permanently storing the entire archive of public Twitter posts since                  
A review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals  privacy of online social networking show the following results   first  adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users  second  policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs  third  in the case of using OSNs and its services  traditional one dimensional privacy approaches fall short               This is exacerbated by deanonymization research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation  race  religious and political views  personality  or intelligence can be inferred based on a wide variety of digital footprints  such as samples of text  browsing logs  or Facebook Likes             
Intrusions of social media privacy are known to affect employment in the United States  Microsoft reports that    percent of U S  recruiters and human resource professionals now do online research about candidates  often using information provided by search engines  social networking sites  photo video sharing sites  personal web sites and blogs  and Twitter  They also report that    percent of U S  recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information  This has created a need by many candidates to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations  the conjunction of which has led to legal suits against both social media sites and US employers

Selfies are popular today  A search for photos with the hashtag  selfie retrieves over    million results on Instagram and    million with the hashtag  me              However  due to modern corporate and governmental surveillance  this may pose a risk to privacy              In a research study which takes a sample size of       researchers found that for users posting selfies on social media  women generally have greater concerns over privacy than men  and that users  privacy concerns inversely predict their selfie behavior and activity             

Online harassment edit 
Main article  Online harassment
Further information  Revenge porn  Doxxing  and Content moderation
An invasion of someone s privacy may be widely and quickly disseminated over the Internet  When social media sites and other online communities fail to invest in content moderation  an invasion of privacy can expose people to a much greater volume and degree of harassment than would otherwise be possible  Revenge porn may lead to misogynist or homophobic harassment  such as in the suicide of Amanda Todd and the suicide of Tyler Clementi  When someone s physical location or other sensitive information is leaked over the Internet via doxxing  harassment may escalate to direct physical harm such as stalking or swatting 
Despite the way breaches of privacy can magnify online harassment  online harassment is often used as a justification to curtail freedom of speech  by removing the expectation of privacy via anonymity  or by enabling law enforcement to invade privacy without a search warrant  In the wake of Amanda Todd s death  the Canadian parliament proposed a motion purporting to stop bullying  but Todd s mother herself gave testimony to parliament rejecting the bill due to its provisions for warrantless breaches of privacy  stating  I don t want to see our children victimized again by losing privacy rights                                      
Even where these laws have been passed despite privacy concerns  they have not demonstrated a reduction in online harassment  When the Korea Communications Commission introduced a registration system for online commenters in       they reported that malicious comments only decreased by       and in      it was repealed              A subsequent analysis found that the set of users who posted the most comments actually increased the number of  aggressive expressions  when forced to use their real name             
In the US  while federal law only prohibits online harassment based on protected characteristics such as gender and race              individual states have expanded the definition of harassment to further curtail speech  Florida s definition of online harassment includes  any use of data or computer software  that  Has the effect of substantially disrupting the orderly operation of a school              

Privacy and location based services edit 
Main article  Location based service
Increasingly  mobile devices facilitate location tracking   This creates user privacy problems   A user s location and preferences constitute personal information  and their improper use violates that user s privacy   A recent MIT study by de Montjoye et al  showed that four spatio temporal points constituting approximate places and times are enough to uniquely identify     of    M people in a mobility database  The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low  Therefore  even coarse or blurred datasets confer little privacy protection             
Several methods to protect user privacy in location based services have been proposed  including the use of anonymizing servers and blurring of information  Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed  to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of obtaining accurate location information and the risks of breaching an individual s privacy             

Ethical controversies over location privacy edit 
There have been scandals regarding location privacy  One instance was the scandal concerning AccuWeather  where it was revealed that AccuWeather was selling locational data  This consisted of a user s locational data  even if they opted out within Accuweather  which tracked users  location  Accuweather sold this data to Reveal Mobile  a company that monetizes data related to a user s location               Other international cases are similar to the Accuweather case  In       a leaky API inside the McDelivery App exposed private data  which consisted of home addresses  of     million users             
In the wake of these types of scandals  many large American technology companies such as Google  Apple  and Facebook have been subjected to hearings and pressure under the U S  legislative system  In       US Senator Al Franken wrote an open letter to Steve Jobs  noting the ability of iPhones and iPads to record and store users  locations in unencrypted files                          Apple claimed this was an unintentional software bug  but Justin Brookman of the Center for Democracy and Technology directly challenged that portrayal  stating  I m glad that they are fixing what they call bugs  but I take exception with their strong denial that they track users               In       the U S  state of Arizona found in a court case that Google misled its users and stored the location of users regardless of their location settings

The Internet has become a significant medium for advertising  with digital marketing making up approximately half of the global ad spending in                   While websites are still able to sell advertising space without tracking  including via contextual advertising  digital ad brokers such as Facebook and Google have instead encouraged the practice of behavioral advertising  providing code snippets used by website owners to track their users via HTTP cookies  This tracking data is also sold to other third parties as part of the mass surveillance industry  Since the introduction of mobile phones  data brokers have also been planted within apps  resulting in a      billion digital industry especially focused on mobile devices             
Digital privacy has become the main source of concern for many mobile users  especially with the rise of privacy scandals such as the Facebook Cambridge Analytica data scandal              Apple has received  some reactions for features that prohibit advertisers from tracking a user s data without their consent              Google attempted to introduce an alternative to cookies named FLoC which it claimed reduced the privacy harms  but it later retracted the proposal due to antitrust probes and analyses that contradicted their claims of privacy

Privacy International      privacy ranking  On one end of the spectrum  green indicates countries that uphold human rights standards while on the other end  red indicates countries considered endemic surveillance societies  This ranking was the last global report conducted by Privacy International  and it is demonstrated that countries that do have the legal right to privacy explicitly mentioned in their constitutions trend closer to yellow and green while those that do not trend closer to red 
Most countries give citizens rights to privacy in their constitutions              Representative examples of this include the Constitution of Brazil  which says  the privacy  private life  honor and image of people are inviolable   the Constitution of South Africa says that  everyone has a right to privacy   and the Constitution of the Republic of Korea says  the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed               The Italian Constitution also defines the right to privacy              Among most countries whose constitutions do not explicitly describe privacy rights  court decisions have interpreted their constitutions to intend to give privacy rights

Free market vs consumer protection edit 
Main article         Conceptions of Privacy
Approaches to privacy can  broadly  be divided into two categories  free market or consumer protection             
One example of the free market approach is to be found in the voluntary OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data              The principles reflected in the guidelines  free of legislative interference  are analyzed in an article putting them into perspective with concepts of the GDPR put into law later in the European Union             
In a consumer protection approach  in contrast  it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices  or may not have reasonable alternatives available  In support of this view  Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person

Although there are comprehensive regulations for data protection in the European Union  one study finds that despite the laws  there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws              The European Union also champions the Right to be Forgotten concept in support of its adoption by other countries

Unlike the EU and most EU member states  the US does not recognize the right to privacy of non US citizens  The UN s Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy  Joseph A  Cannataci  criticized this distinction              

Conceptions of privacy edit 
Privacy as contextual integrity edit 
Main article  Contextual integrity
The theory of contextual integrity               developed by Helen Nissenbaum  defines privacy as an appropriate information flow  where appropriateness  in turn  is defined as conformance with legitimate  informational norms specific to social contexts 

Right to be let alone edit 
In       the United States jurists Samuel D  Warren and Louis Brandeis wrote  The Right to Privacy   an article in which they argued for the  right to be let alone   using that phrase as a definition of privacy               This concept relies on the theory of natural rights and focuses on protecting individuals  The citation was a response to recent technological developments  such as photography  and sensationalist journalism  also known as yellow journalism              
There is extensive commentary over the meaning of being  let alone   and among other ways  it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose seclusion from the attention of others if they wish to do so  and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings  such as one s own home               Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy  it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights in the US              

Limited access edit 
Limited access refers to a person s ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about them              
Various theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one s personal information               Edwin Lawrence Godkin wrote in the late   th century that  nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life  or  in other words  the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself  and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion                             Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison              Nine years earlier               Sissela Bok said that privacy is  the condition of being protected from unwanted access by others either physical access  personal information  or attention                            

Control over information edit 
Control over one s personal information is the concept that  privacy is the claim of individuals  groups  or institutions to determine for themselves when  how  and to what extent information about them is communicated to others   Generally  a person who has consensually formed an interpersonal relationship with another person is not considered  protected  by privacy rights with respect to the person they are in the relationship with                            Charles Fried said that  Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others  rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves  Nevertheless  in the era of big data  control over information is under pressure                                This quote needs a citation          check quotation syntax     

States of privacy edit 
Alan Westin defined four states or experiences of privacy  solitude  intimacy  anonymity  and reserve  Solitude is a physical separation from others               Intimacy is a  close  relaxed  and frank relationship between two or more individuals  that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals               Anonymity is the  desire of individuals for times of  public privacy                 Lastly  reserve is the  creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion   this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual s need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning themself              
In addition to the psychological barrier of reserve  Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers  physical  behavioral  and normative  Physical barriers  such as walls and doors  prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual                In this sense   accessing  an individual includes accessing personal information about them                Behavioral barriers communicate to others verbally  through language  or non verbally  through personal space  body language  or clothing that an individual does not want the other person to access or experience them               Lastly  normative barriers  such as laws and social norms  restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual              

Privacy as personal control edit 
Psychologist Carl A  Johnson has identified the psychological concept of  personal control  as closely tied to privacy  His concept was developed as a process containing four stages and two behavioural outcome relationships  with one s outcomes depending on situational as well as personal factors               Privacy is described as  behaviors falling at specific locations on these two dimensions               
Johnson examined the following four stages to categorize where people exercise personal control  outcome choice control is the selection between various outcomes  Behaviour selection control is the selection between behavioural strategies to apply to attain selected outcomes  Outcome effectance describes the fulfillment of selected behaviour to achieve chosen outcomes  Outcome realization control is the personal interpretation of one s achieved outcome  The relationship between two factors  primary and secondary control  is defined as the two dimensional phenomenon where one reaches personal control  primary control describes behaviour directly causing outcomes  while secondary control is behaviour indirectly causing outcomes               Johnson explores the concept that privacy is a behaviour that has secondary control over outcomes 
Lorenzo Magnani expands on this concept by highlighting how privacy is essential in maintaining personal control over one s identity and consciousness               He argues that consciousness is partly formed by external representations of ourselves  such as narratives and data  which are stored outside the body  However  much of our consciousness consists of internal representations that remain private and are rarely externalized  This internal privacy  which Magnani refers to as a form of  information property  or  moral capital   is crucial for preserving free choice and personal agency  According to Magnani               when too much of our identity and data is externalized and subjected to scrutiny  it can lead to a loss of personal control  dignity  and responsibility  The protection of privacy  therefore  safeguards our ability to develop and pursue personal projects in our own way  free from intrusive external forces 
Acknowledging other conceptions of privacy while arguing that the fundamental concern of privacy is behavior selection control  Johnson converses with other interpretations including those of Maxine Wolfe and Robert S  Laufer  and Irwin Altman  He clarifies the continuous relationship between privacy and personal control  where outlined behaviours not only depend on privacy  but the conception of one s privacy also depends on his defined behavioural outcome relationships              

Secrecy edit 
Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy  Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to  conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage                            
In various legal contexts  when privacy is described as secrecy  a conclusion is reached  if privacy is secrecy  then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed               When privacy as secrecy is discussed  it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private              

Personhood and autonomy edit 
Privacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood  Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of one s ownership of their physical and mental reality and a moral right to self determination               Through the  social ritual  of privacy  or the social practice of respecting an individual s privacy barriers  the social group communicates to developing children that they have exclusive moral rights to their bodies in other words  moral ownership of their body               This entails control over both active  physical  and cognitive appropriation  the former being control over one s movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience one s physical existence and when              
Alternatively  Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agency as an individual with the capacity to choose               Privacy is required to exercise choice               Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a  determinate character  and  limited probabilities                Covert observation  on the other hand  changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consent              
In addition  privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy  a concept closely connected to that of personhood  According to Joseph Kufer  an autonomous self concept entails a conception of oneself as a  purposeful  self determining  responsible agent  and an awareness of one s capacity to control the boundary between self and other that is  to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent               Furthermore  others must acknowledge and respect the self s boundaries in other words  they must respect the individual s privacy              
The studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that  as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent  they develop an autonomous self concept               In addition  studies of adults in particular institutions  such as Erving Goffman s study of  total institutions  such as prisons and mental institutions               suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate one s sense of autonomy over time              

Self identity and personal growth edit 
Privacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of self identity  Privacy barriers  in particular  are instrumental in this process  According to Irwin Altman  such barriers  define and limit the boundaries of the self  and thus  serve to help define  the self                 This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others               Control over the  permeability  of the self s boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the self              
In addition  privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth  a process integral to the development of self identity  Hyman Gross suggested that  without privacy solitude  anonymity  and temporary releases from social roles individuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in self discovery and self criticism               Such self discovery and self criticism contributes to one s understanding of oneself and shapes one s sense of identity              

Intimacy edit 
In a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual  the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or intimate relationships with other humans               Because part of human relationships includes individuals volunteering to self disclose most if not all personal information  this is one area in which privacy does not apply              
James Rachels advanced this notion by writing that privacy matters because  there is a close connection between our ability to control who has access to us and to information about us  and our ability to create and maintain different sorts of social relationships with different people                             Protecting intimacy is at the core of the concept of sexual privacy  which law professor Danielle Citron argues should be protected as a unique form of privacy              

Physical privacy edit 
Physical privacy could be defined as preventing  intrusions into one s physical space or solitude                An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the U S  Fourth Amendment  which guarantees  the right of the people to be secure in their persons  houses  papers  and effects  against unreasonable searches and seizures               
Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity  personal dignity  and or shyness  There may also be concerns about safety  if  for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or stalking               There are different things that can be prevented to protect one s physical privacy  including people watching  even through recorded images  one s intimate behaviours or intimate parts and unauthorized access to one s personal possessions or places  Examples of possible efforts used to avoid the former  especially for modesty reasons  are clothes  walls  fences  privacy screens  cathedral glass  window coverings  etc 

Organizational edit 
Government agencies  corporations  groups societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals  adopting various security practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential  Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets  For example  a government administration may be able to invoke executive privilege              or declare certain information to be classified  or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as trade secrets              

Privacy self synchronization edit 
Privacy self synchronization is a hypothesized mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program s maximum success  The stakeholders may be customers  employees  managers  executives  suppliers  partners or investors  When self synchronization is reached  the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals              

An individual right edit 
David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy  He develops  data protection  as an aspect of privacy  which involves  the collection  use  and dissemination of personal information   This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally  Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control    i ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used               
Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control  Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information  which reduces market efficiency  For Posner  employment is selling oneself in the labour market  which he believes is like selling a product  Any  defect  in the  product  that is not reported is fraud               For Lessig  privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law  Lessig claims  the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right                and that  individuals should be able to control information about themselves               

A collective value and a human right edit 
There have been attempts to establish privacy as one of the fundamental human rights  whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies              
Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy  She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions  shared perceptions  public values  and collective components  Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought  Public values guarantee democratic participation  including freedoms of speech and association  and limits government power  Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided  Regan s goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making   if we did recognize the collective or public good value of privacy  as well as the common and public value of privacy  those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection               
Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation  and ensures human dignity and autonomy  Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed  and if this is appropriate  Violations of privacy depend on context  The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights   Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression  this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek  receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers                Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people centered perspective  and not through the marketplace              
Dr  Eliza Watt  Westminster Law School  University of Westminster in London  UK  proposes application of the International Human Right Law  IHRL  concept of  virtual control  as an approach to deal with extraterritorial mass surveillance by state intelligence agencies  Dr  Watt envisions the  virtual control  test  understood as a remote control over the individual s right to privacy of communications  where privacy is recognized under the ICCPR  Article     This  she contends  may help to close the normative gap that is being exploited by nation states              

Privacy paradox and economic valuation edit 
The privacy paradox is a phenomenon in which online users state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave as if they were not               While this term was coined as early as                    it was not used in its current popular sense until the year                                
Susan B  Barnes similarly used the term privacy paradox to refer to the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media               When compared to adults  young people tend to disclose more information on social media  However  this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy  Susan B  Barnes gave a case in her article  in a television interview about Facebook  a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online  However  when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page  she put her home address  phone numbers  and pictures of her young son on the page 
The privacy paradox has been studied and scripted in different research settings  Several studies have shown this inconsistency between privacy attitudes and behavior among online users               However  by now an increasing number of studies have also shown that there are significant and at times large correlations between privacy concerns and information sharing behavior               which speaks against the privacy paradox  A meta analysis of     studies published on the topic reported an overall small but significant relation between privacy concerns and informations sharing or use of privacy protection measures               So although there are several individual instances or anecdotes where behavior appear paradoxical  on average privacy concerns and privacy behaviors seem to be related  and several findings question the general existence of the privacy paradox              
However  the relationship between concerns and behavior is likely only small  and there are several arguments that can explain why that is the case  According to the attitude behavior gap  attitudes and behaviors are in general and in most cases not closely related               A main explanation for the partial mismatch in the context of privacy specifically is that users lack awareness of the risks and the degree of protection               Users may underestimate the harm of disclosing information online              On the other hand  some researchers argue that the mismatch comes from lack of technology literacy and from the design of sites                For example  users may not know how to change their default settings even though they care about their privacy  Psychologists Sonja Utz and Nicole C  Kr mer particularly pointed out that the privacy paradox can occur when users must trade off between their privacy concerns and impression management              

Research on irrational decision making edit 
Further information         Social networking  and        Advertising on Mobile Devices
A study conducted by Susanne Barth and Menno D T  de Jo demonstrates that decision making takes place on an irrational level  especially when it comes to mobile computing  Mobile applications in particular are often built up in such a way that spurs decision making that is fast and automatic without assessing risk factors  Protection measures against these unconscious mechanisms are often difficult to access while downloading and installing apps  Even with mechanisms in place to protect user privacy  users may not have the knowledge or experience to enable these mechanisms              
Users of mobile applications generally have very little knowledge of how their personal data are used  When they decide which application to download  they typically are not able to effectively interpret the information provided by application vendors regarding the collection and use of personal data               Other research finds that this lack of interpretability means users are much more likely to be swayed by cost  functionality  design  ratings  reviews and number of downloads than requested permissions for usage of their personal data              

The economic valuation of privacy edit 
See also  Surveillance capitalism and Mass surveillance industry
The willingness to incur a privacy risk is suspected to be driven by a complex array of factors including risk attitudes  personal value for private information  and general attitudes to privacy  which are typically measured using surveys                One experiment aiming to determine the monetary value of several types of personal information indicated relatively low evaluations of personal information               Despite claims that ascertaining the value of data requires a  stock market for personal information                surveillance capitalism and the mass surveillance industry regularly place price tags on this form of data as it is shared between corporations and governments 

Information asymmetry edit 
Users are not always given the tools to live up to their professed privacy concerns  and they are sometimes willing to trade private information for convenience  functionality  or financial gain  even when the gains are very small               One study suggests that people think their browser history is worth the equivalent of a cheap meal               Another finds that attitudes to privacy risk do not appear to depend on whether it is already under threat or not               The methodology of user empowerment describes how to provide users with sufficient context to make privacy informed decisions 

Inherent necessity for privacy violation edit 
Further information  Privacy concerns with social networking services
It is suggested by Andr a Belliger and David J  Krieger that the privacy paradox should not be considered a paradox  but more of a privacy dilemma  for services that cannot exist without the user sharing private data               However  the general public is typically not given the choice whether to share private data or not                          making it difficult to verify any claim that a service truly cannot exist without sharing private data 

Privacy calculus model edit 
This section needs expansion     with  more description of the mechanics of the privacy calculus model and how it relates to the privacy paradox  You can help by adding to it    June      
The privacy calculus model posits that two factors determine privacy behavior  namely privacy concerns  or perceived risks  and expected benefits                            By now  the privacy calculus has been supported by several studies                           

Actions which reduce privacy edit 
As with other conceptions of privacy  there are various ways to discuss what kinds of processes or actions remove  challenge  lessen  or attack privacy  In      legal scholar William Prosser created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection                           

Intrusion into a person s private space  own affairs  or wish for solitude             
Public disclosure of personal information about a person which could be embarrassing for them to have revealed             
Promoting access to information about a person which could lead the public to have incorrect beliefs about them             
Encroaching someone s personality rights  and using their likeness to advance interests which are not their own             
From      to       building from this and other historical precedents  Daniel J  Solove presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy  including collection of information which is already somewhat public  processing of information  sharing information  and invading personal space to get private information              

Collecting information edit 
In the context of harming privacy  information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it               Examples include surveillance and interrogation               Another example is how consumers and marketers also collect information in the business context through facial recognition which has recently caused a concern for things such as privacy  There is currently research being done related to this topic              
Companies like Google and Meta collect vast amounts of personal data from their users through various services and platforms  This data includes browsing habits  search history  location information  and even personal communications  These companies then analyze and aggregate this data to create detailed user profiles  which are sold to advertisers and other third parties  This practice is often done without explicit user consent  leading to an invasion of privacy as individuals have little control over how their information is used  The sale of personal data can result in targeted advertising  manipulation  and even potential security risks  as sensitive information can be exploited by malicious actors  This commercial exploitation of personal data undermines user trust and raises significant ethical and legal concerns regarding data protection and privacy rights              

Aggregating information edit 
It can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available  but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set  then processed together in such a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy               Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following              

data aggregation  which is connecting many related but unconnected pieces of information             
identification  which can mean breaking the de identification of items of data by putting it through a de anonymization process  thus making facts which were intended to not name particular people to become associated with those people             
insecurity  such as lack of data security  which includes when an organization is supposed to be responsible for protecting data instead suffers a data breach which harms the people whose data it held             
secondary use  which is when people agree to share their data for a certain purpose  but then the data is used in ways without the data donors  informed consent             
exclusion is the use of a person s data without any attempt to give the person an opportunity to manage the data or participate in its usage             
Information dissemination edit 
Count not him among your friends who will retail your privacies to the world         Publilius Syrus
Information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the information              
There are various examples of this               Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a person s information private  then breaks that promise               Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information  regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available               Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share  such as revealing their private life experiences  their nudity  or perhaps private body functions               Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it  as in the case of doxing               Blackmail is making a threat to share information  perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone               Appropriation is an attack on the personhood of someone  and can include using the value of someone s reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated               Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person              

Invasion edit 
Invasion of privacy  a subset of expectation of privacy  is a different concept from the collecting  aggregating  and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data  whereas invasion is an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets               An invasion is an attack in which information  whether intended to be public or not  is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken              

Intrusion edit 
An intrusion is any unwanted entry into a person s private personal space and solitude for any reason  regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space               Decisional interference is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decision making process of another person  perhaps to influence that person s private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has              

Examples of invasions of privacy edit 
In       contract workers for Apple and Amazon reported being forced to continue listening to  intimate moments  captured on the companies  smart speakers in order to improve the quality of their automated speech recognition software             
Techniques to improve privacy edit

Anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like I P and Tor can be used to prevent Internet service providers  ISP  from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates  by hiding IP addresses and location  but does not necessarily protect a user from third party data mining  Anonymizing proxies are built into a user s device  in comparison to a Virtual Private Network  VPN   where users must download software               Using a VPN hides all data and connections that are exchanged between servers and a user s computer  resulting in the online data of the user being unshared and secure  providing a barrier between the user and their ISP  and is especially important to use when a user is connected to public Wi Fi  However  users should understand that all their data does flow through the VPN s servers rather than the ISP  Users should decide for themselves if they wish to use either an anonymizing proxy or a VPN 
In a more non technical sense  using incognito mode or private browsing mode will prevent a user s computer from saving history  Internet files  and cookies  but the ISP will still have access to the users  search history  Using anonymous search engines will not share a user s history  clicks  and will obstruct ad blockers              

User empowerment edit 
Further information  End user

Concrete solutions on how to solve paradoxical behavior still do not exist  Many efforts are focused on processes of decision making  like restricting data access permissions during application installation  but this would not completely bridge the gap between user intention and behavior  Susanne Barth and Menno D T  de Jong believe that for users to make more conscious decisions on privacy matters  the design needs to be more user oriented               That being said  delivering on privacy protections is difficult due to the complexity of online consent processes  for example              

Other security measures edit 
In a social sense  simply limiting the amount of personal information that users posts on social media could increase their security  which in turn makes it harder for criminals to perform identity theft                Moreover  creating a set of complex passwords and using two factor authentication can allow users to be less susceptible to their accounts being compromised when various data leaks occur  Furthermore  users should protect their digital privacy by using anti virus software  which can block harmful viruses like a pop up scanning for personal information on a users  computer              

Legal methods edit 
Although there are laws that promote the protection of users  in some countries  like the U S   there is no federal digital privacy law and privacy settings are essentially limited by the state of current enacted privacy laws  To further their privacy  users can start conversing with representatives  letting representatives know that privacy is a main concern  which in turn increases the likelihood of further privacy laws being enacted              

Privacy in non human animals edit 
David Attenborough  a biologist and natural historian  affirmed that gorillas  value their privacy  while discussing a brief escape by a gorilla in London Zoo              
Lack of privacy in public spaces  caused by overcrowding  increases health issues in animals  including heart disease and high blood pressure  Also  the stress from overcrowding is connected to an increase in infant mortality rates and maternal stress  The lack of privacy that comes with overcrowding is connected to other issues in animals  which causes their relationships with others to diminish  How they present themselves to others of their species is a necessity in their life  and overcrowding causes the relationships to become disordered              
For example  David Attenborough claims that the gorilla s right to privacy is being violated when they are looked at through glass enclosures  They are aware that they are being looked at  therefore they do not have control over how much the onlookers can see of them  Gorillas and other animals may be in the enclosures due to safety reasons  however Attenborough states that this is not an excuse for them to be constantly watched by unnecessary eyes  Also  animals will start hiding in unobserved spaces               Animals in zoos have been found to exhibit harmful or different behaviours due to the presence of visitors watching them              

Cotton top tamarins in zoos engage in less social behaviours  including physical contact and sex  than ones in off exhibit buildings 
Chimpanzees become more aggressive towards each other 
Lion tailed macaques pace and bite themselves more in direct proportions to human visitors 
In one zoo  orangutans have been shown to cover their heads less as the density of visitors decreased
