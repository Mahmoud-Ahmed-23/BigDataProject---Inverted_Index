							The celebrated Somya El Khashab continues to leave an enduring imprint on Arab audiences through her compelling performances and discerning artistic choices  This time  she ventures into uncharted territory with the Gulf drama  Om Arbaa Wa Arbaeen  her first leading role in a Gulf based production  In this series  she portrays an Egyptian woman living in a Gulf society  navigating a story woven with suspense and rich emotional layers  In this exclusive conversation  Somya shares the story behind the series  her creative journey  and the challenges she faced in what she calls her most treasured work 
What compelled you to take on  Om Arbaa Wa Arbaeen  
 Om Arbaa Wa Arbaeen  is unlike anything I ve done before both in its narrative depth and its cultural context  The script is brimming with complex character arcs and powerful themes  particularly those surrounding Arab women in their post marital lives and during their forties  I was actively seeking a fresh challenge within Gulf drama  and the moment I read the script  I felt an immediate connection  There was no hesitation I knew I had to be part of it 
What sets your character  Mahtaba  apart from your previous roles 
Mahtaba isn t your typical wife or mother  She represents the quintessential Egyptian woman living in the Gulf  dealing with the intricacies of married life  her dynamic with her mother in law  and the layered experience of motherhood  She s a richly written character  blending comedy  sorrow  and romantic longing  It s undoubtedly one of the most multifaceted and emotionally intense roles I ve ever played 
What was your experience like working with the ensemble cast 
I ve always believed that strong ensemble work is the foundation of any great artistic project  It fosters cohesion and enriches the storytelling  especially in a narrative like  Om Arbaa Wa Arbaeen   which weaves together multiple storylines  I ve had the pleasure of working in acclaimed ensemble dramas like  Heena Maysara  and  Alrayes Omar Harb   and I ve found that this format consistently resonates with audiences in a profound way

How was it collaborating with Gulf and Arab stars 
It was truly an exceptional experience  Working alongside prominent talents from across the Arab world brought a dynamic richness to the project  I was fortunate to share the screen with the esteemed Saudi actor Nayef Khalaf  the brilliant Kuwaiti star Shahab Hajiya  the talented Iraqi actress Mays Qamar  and the powerful Emirati performer Huda Al Khatib  among others  The atmosphere on set was filled with warmth  respect  and creative synergy very much like the spirited camaraderie I cherished during the filming of  Aelat Al Hajj Mutualiy  
What was your impression of filming in Saudi Arabia 
While extended absences from Egypt are never easy for me  filming in Saudi Arabia was truly a remarkable experience  I felt an immediate sense of comfort and belonging  immersed in the Kingdom s spiritually resonant atmosphere  Saudi Arabia is currently undergoing a vibrant cultural and artistic renaissance  and throughout the production  we were met with unwavering support at every turn 
Did you set any conditions before accepting the role 
Not at all  This project encompassed everything I look for in a production ambitious in scale  generously resourced  and executed with exceptional quality  It was produced by MBC  one of the most influential media networks in the Arab world  and an institution I am always eager to work with 
Which scene was the most challenging to film 
Mahtaba s journey is emotionally intense  and nearly every scene demanded a high level of performance  She experiences deep personal turmoil and confronts difficult societal realities  A number of scenes will undoubtedly resonate strongly with viewers particularly those touching on sensitive issues that are often left unspoken 
How do you view the competitive landscape of the Ramadan      television season 
Competition is a constant in our field  but I measure myself against my own growth  My focus is always on surpassing my previous work and offering audiences my very best  While I welcome healthy competition  my priority remains crafting work that is impactful and memorable

What s next after  Om Arbaa Wa Arbaeen  
Several proposals are currently under consideration  but I m waiting to see how  Om Arbaa Wa Arbaeen  is received before making any decisions  I take a very selective approach to my work I strive to choose projects with true artistic value that will endure and connect meaningfully with audiences 
What led to your recent hiatus from the screen 
My absence was a conscious  principled choice both for my own integrity and out of respect for my audience  I cannot commit to a role that doesn t ignite my artistic passion  and viewers  as discerning as they are  would sense that lack of conviction  I received numerous offers  but none resonated with me creatively  Every artist needs time to recharge it s a natural part of the journey 
Have you ever taken on roles that didn t meet audience expectations 
Yes  I won t deny it  In the early stages of my career  I accepted certain roles simply to establish a foothold in the industry  But with time  I ve become far more selective  I now choose projects that align with my artistic values and help me grow as a performer 
How do you view competition among actresses of your generation 
I ve never been overly concerned with competition  I believe each actress brings her own unique artistry to the table  I have no desire to emulate anyone  nor do I want to be emulated  Imitation is often the fastest path to obscurity 
Are there any upcoming cinematic projects 
Absolutely I ve dearly missed the world of cinema  I ve been reviewing several scripts  and I intend to return to the silver screen with a film that reflects the strength of my comeback 
Any final message for your audience 
To my loyal audience  I say this  the best is yet to come  I carefully choose every project  and I promise to return with work that honors your trust and matches the depth of your continued support
