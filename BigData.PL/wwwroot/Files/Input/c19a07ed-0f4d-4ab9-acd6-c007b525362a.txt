The Shura Council discussed the proposed NGO law on Monday  amid fears over deteriorating human rights conditions 
During the discussion  Mohamed Al Demerdash  an advisor to the Ministry of Insurance and Social Affairs  said the ministry does not object to the formation of NGOs by notification and called for this practice to be incorporated in the law  state run EGYNews reported 
Al Demerdash also commended the Shura Council s efforts to limit the role of security in civil society 
However  the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights  EOHR  expressed  intensive worry for the deteriorating situation of all the international and local civil society organisations in Egypt and the fund drying measures that are badly affecting the defence of human rights   in a statement published on its website 
The EOHR received a letter from the Ministry of Insurance and Social Solidarity several days ago informing the organisation that no local entity is allowed to engage with international entities without permission from security bodies 
In response  the human rights organisation said it always takes official measures even if that means that its projects are rejected without  any objective reasons  
Amnesty International reported that the government refused to grant the human rights group permission to work on a project on the freedom to form associations last year 
Hafez Abu Se da  Chairman of the EOHR  also expressed concerns over continued attempts to exclude human rights organisations  the group said on its website  The group added that human rights groups hoped the      revolution would remove restrictions and obstacles in the way of civil society s progress 
Amnesty said the draft law tightens restrictions on NGOs and in some cases restricts their ability to conduct fact finding missions and obtain funding 
In December       several NGOs were raided and over    people  including foreigners  were arrested and put on trial for receiving illegal funding 
EOHR called for amending the current law to give NGOs more space to carry out public service activities
