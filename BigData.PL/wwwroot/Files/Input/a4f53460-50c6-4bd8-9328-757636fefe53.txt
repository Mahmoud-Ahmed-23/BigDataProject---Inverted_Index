LeCun at the University of Minnesota      
LeCun was born on   July       at Soisy sous Montmorency in the suburbs of Paris  His name  Le Cun  originates from the old Breton form Le Cunff  and was from the region of Guingamp in northern Brittany   Yann  is the Breton form for  John             
He received a Dipl me d Ing nieur from the ESIEE Paris in      and a Ph D  in computer science from Universit  Pierre et Marie Curie  today Sorbonne University  in      during which he proposed an early form of the back propagation learning algorithm for neural networks              Before joining AT amp T              LeCun was a postdoc for a year  starting in       under Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto 

Career edit 
Bell Labs edit 
In       LeCun joined the Adaptive Systems Research Department at AT amp T Bell Laboratories in Holmdel  New Jersey  United States  headed by Lawrence D  Jackel  where he developed a number of new machine learning methods  such as a biologically inspired model of image recognition called convolutional neural networks  LeNet               the  Optimal Brain Damage  regularization methods              and the Graph Transformer Networks method  similar to conditional random field   which he applied to handwriting recognition and Optical character recognition  OCR               The bank check recognition system that he helped develop was widely deployed by NCR and other companies  reading over     of all the checks in the US in the late     s and early     s      citation needed     
In       he joined AT amp T Labs Research as head of the Image Processing Research Department  which was part of Lawrence Rabiner s Speech and Image Processing Research Lab  and worked primarily on the DjVu image compression technology              used by many websites  notably the Internet Archive  to distribute scanned documents      citation needed      His collaborators at AT amp T include L on Bottou and Vladimir Vapnik 

New York University edit 
After a brief tenure as a Fellow of the NEC Research Institute  now NEC Labs America  in Princeton  NJ  LeCun joined New York University  NYU  in       where he is Jacob T  Schwartz Chaired Professor of Computer Science and Neural Science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the Center for Neural Science  He is also a professor at the Tandon School of Engineering                          At NYU  he has worked primarily on Energy Based Models for supervised and unsupervised learning              feature learning for object recognition in Computer Vision              and mobile robotics
