Marvin Lee Minsky  August           January           was an American cognitive and computer scientist concerned largely with research in artificial intelligence  AI   He co founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology s AI laboratory and wrote extensively about AI and philosophy                                                 
Minsky received many accolades and honors  including the      Turing Award 


Early life and education edit 
Marvin Lee Minsky was born in New York City  to Henry  an eye surgeon  and Fannie  Reiser   a Zionist activist                                      His family was Jewish  He attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School and the Bronx High School of Science  He later attended Phillips Academy in Andover  Massachusetts  He then served in the US Navy from      to       He received a B A  in mathematics from Harvard University in      and a Ph D  in mathematics from Princeton University in       His doctoral dissertation was titled  Theory of neural analog reinforcement systems and its application to the brain model problem                                       He was a Junior Fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows from      to                              
Minsky was on the MIT faculty from      to his death  He joined the staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in       a year later  he and John McCarthy initiated what was  as of          update       named the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory                           He was the Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences as well as professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT 

Contributions in computer science edit

Minsky s inventions include the first head mounted graphical display                    and the confocal microscope                note               a predecessor to today s widely used confocal laser scanning microscope   With Seymour Papert  he developed the first Logo  turtle   In       Minsky built the first randomly wired neural network learning machine  SNARC  In       he worked on small universal Turing machines and published his well known   state    symbol machine             
Minsky s book Perceptrons  written with Papert  attacked the work of Frank Rosenblatt  and became the foundational work in the analysis of artificial neural networks  The book is the center of a controversy in the history of AI  as some claim it greatly discouraged research on neural networks in the     s and contributed to the so called  AI winter               Minsky also founded several other AI models  His paper  A framework for representing knowledge              created a new paradigm in knowledge representation  Perceptrons is now more a historical than practical book  but the theory of frames is in wide use              Minsky also wrote of the possibility that extraterrestrial life may think like humans  thus permitting communication             
In the early     s  at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab  Minsky and Papert started developing what came to be known as the Society of Mind theory  The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non intelligent parts  Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas for the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm  a videocamera  and a computer to build with children s blocks  In       he published The Society of Mind  a comprehensive book on the theory which  unlike most of his previously published work  was written for the general public

In       Minsky published The Emotion Machine  a book that critiques many popular theories of how human minds work and suggests alternative theories  often replacing simple ideas with more complex ones  Drafts of the book are available on his website             
Minsky also invented a  gravity machine  that will ring a bell if the gravitational constant changes  a theoretical possibility that is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future            

Role in popular culture edit 
Minsky was an adviser             on Stanley Kubrick s movie       A Space Odyssey  one of the movie s characters  Victor Kaminski  was named in Minsky s honor              Minsky is mentioned explicitly in Arthur C  Clarke s derivative novel of the same name  where he is portrayed as achieving a crucial breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the then future     s  paving the way for HAL      in the early   st century 

In the     s  Minsky and Good had shown how artificial neural networks could be generated automatically self replicated in accordance with any arbitrary learning program  Artificial brains could be grown by a process strikingly analogous to the development of a human brain  In any given case  the precise details would never be known  and even if they were  they would be millions of times too complex for human understanding             
In  The Law of Non Contradiction   episode   of the television anthology series Fargo  Season     at least two allusions to Minsky are made  The first is through the depiction of a  useless machine   a device Minsky invented as a philosophical joke  The second is through the depiction of an animation of a robot called  minsky  a character in a sci fi novel called The Planet Wyh 

Personal life edit

In       Minsky married pediatrician Gloria Rudisch  together they had three children              Minsky was a talented improvisational pianist             who published musings on the relations between music and psychology 

Opinions edit 
Minsky was an atheist              He was a signatory to the Scientists  Open Letter on Cryonics             
He was a critic of the Loebner Prize for conversational robots              and argued that a fundamental difference between humans and machines is that while humans are machines  they are machines in which intelligence emerges from the interplay of the many unintelligent but semi autonomous agents the brain comprises              He argued that  somewhere down the line  some computers will become more intelligent than most people   but that it was very hard to predict how fast progress would be              He cautioned that an artificial superintelligence designed to solve an innocuous mathematical problem might decide to assume control of Earth s resources to build supercomputers to help achieve its goal              but believed that such scenarios are  hard to take seriously  because he felt confident that AI would be well tested before being deployed             

Association with Jeffrey Epstein edit 
Minsky received a          research grant from Jeffrey Epstein in       four years before Epstein s first arrest for sex offenses  it was the first from Epstein to MIT  Minsky received no further research grants from him                         
Minsky organized two academic symposia on Epstein s private island Little Saint James  one in      and another in       after Epstein was a registered sex offender              Virginia Giuffre testified in a      deposition in her defamation lawsuit against Epstein s associate Ghislaine Maxwell that Maxwell  directed  her to have sex with Minsky  among others  There has been no allegation that sex between them took place nor a lawsuit against Minsky s estate              Minsky s widow  Gloria Rudisch  says that he could not have had sex with any of the women at Epstein s residences  as they were always together during all the visits to Epstein s residences             

Death edit 
Minsky died of a cerebral hemorrhage in January       at age                 Minsky was a member of Alcor Life Extension Foundation s Scientific Advisory Board              Alcor will neither confirm nor deny whether Minsky was cryonically preserved
