							In her Heliopolis salon  where the scent of coffee mingles with the fragrance of memory  Elham Shahin welcomed us after her return from Los Angeles  The room was unmistakably hers walls lined with vintage film stills  shelves adorned with trophies and accolades  each whispering tales of an artist who waged the battles of art with unwavering conviction  We spoke about her recent role as jury president at the Hollywood Arab Film Festival  her performance in Seed El Nass  and her comeback to radio after two decades 
 nbsp 
What did it mean to you to chair the jury at the Hollywood Arab Film Festival 
It was a mix of pride and responsibility  Being invited to preside over a jury in the heart of Hollywood the world s cinema capital wasn t just an honor for me  but for Arab cinema  It felt like we ve moved beyond simply submitting our films to global festivals  we re now contributing to the conversation and shaping standards 
What was your impression of the films in competition 
I was truly impressed  The films showed maturity  boldness  and a fearless approach to storytelling  They tackled taboos and reflected reality with strong cinematic tools  Some of them hit me hard  like a mirror reflecting both our dreams and our wounds not just stories  but statements 
Was this experience different from judging at Arab festivals 
Absolutely  At Arab festivals  I m on familiar ground I understand the audience and cultural nuances  But in Hollywood  the challenge was greater  to stay rooted in my identity while engaging with a global lens  I wasn t just an artist there I was representing the Arab woman  the intellectual  the cinematic voice 
Was there a specific moment that moved you during the festival 
Yes  during the screening of a short Palestinian film  The standing ovation lasted over two minutes  It wasn t just applause it was recognition of a cause  a collective grief  and a glimmer of hope  That s the power of art it can say what politics never can  One truthful image can shift perception 
What stood out to you about the young filmmakers there 
Many were Arab students of cinema in the US  Their films were fresh  passionate  and deeply connected to identity  The dialogues around them were thoughtful  and the festival became a bridge linking communities and reconnecting generations with their cultural roots 
Do you feel festivals like this can truly support Arab cinema 
It s a step forward  It s not enough for our films to be screened they must be understood  critiqued  and appreciated  The Hollywood Arab Film Festival is a platform for cultural dialogue  not just recognition  We don t need flattery we need real engagement 
How would you describe this stage of your artistic journey 
I m more at peace  but the fire still burns  I watch everything  I get excited about new talents  and I still want to make a difference even with a word  a gesture  or being part of a sincere festival  That s how I stay alive in art not just alive 
You had two major roles this Ramadan  How did the audience respond 
I was in the TV drama Seed El Nass and the radio series  El Giran Liba daha   Each came with its own challenge  In Seed El Nass  I played a controversial character   El Giran Liba daha  marked my return to radio after more than    years it felt like coming home 
Let s talk about Etemad El Hawary in Seed El Nass  The character sparked strong reactions 
I despised that character more than any I ve ever played  She was mentally unwell  full of inner scars  forced into early marriage  deprived of education  and humiliated throughout her life  That bred bitterness  But from an acting standpoint  she was a goldmine full of layers and challenges  That s what any real actor lives for 
Some critics found her emotional outbursts and loudness excessive  Your take 
That loudness was a mask her weakness trying to pose as strength  She was broken inside  desperate for attention  Even her eccentric clothes and jewelry weren t vanity they were a cry for acknowledgment 
Did you consult psychologists while preparing for the role 
No need  Etemad exists in our reality  I ve seen her in the streets  in communities  With my life experience and years of acting  I drew on real people I ve encountered and built her from there 
Weren t you afraid the audience would hate her 
Not at all  That s the sign of success  When the love I ve earned through past roles turns into glares on the street  I know I ve done something right  They re not hating me they re hating the truth in the performance 
You ve often played mothers even to older actors  Was that ever awkward 
Never  I played Hussein Fahmy s mother in  Al Embrator  and Hisham Selim s in  Al Harafeesh   and I never hesitated  I m not chasing the stereotype of the glamorous heroine  I seek the soul of the character  Acting is a love affair not a status ladder 
What pulled you back into radio after such a long hiatus 
The script         El Giran Liba daha        is a soul stirring work  centered on values like love  forgiveness  and solidarity  It s presented with gentle simplicity  and that kind of depth always draws me in 
What s your take on the rise of    episode series 
I prefer them  They re more focused  more authentic  Unlike    episode series  which sometimes stretch too thin  these feel tighter and more honest  And frankly     hour filming days  That s brutal it s not humane 
Finally where is Elham Shahin heading next 
Wherever the truth is  To cinema that dares to question  To festivals that recognize talent  not fame  To films that confront rather than flatter  And to an audience that understands art isn t a luxury it s a necessity
